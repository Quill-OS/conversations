[matrix] Szybet actually not, the discord bot gets confused


[9/17/2023 3:27 AM] dandelionkoi
have you thought about porting InkBox to the Hisense A5?


[9/17/2023 3:27 AM] dandelionkoi
would that even be possible/reasonably easy?


[9/17/2023 3:35 AM] tux_linux
Probably not


[9/17/2023 3:35 AM] kuratius
Easiest ports are those whereyou have a way to recover from bricks+ serial access afsik


[9/17/2023 3:36 AM] kuratius
So removable storage


[9/17/2023 3:36 AM] kuratius
Or a Flashing tool that works with corrupted main storage


[9/17/2023 3:36 AM] tux_linux
Yes, but even then, Hisense has an Android platform afaik


[9/17/2023 3:37 AM] tux_linux
Which makes it kind of harder to port inkbox kernel over


[9/17/2023 3:38 AM] dandelionkoi
yeah, its android with a lot of built in chinese apps, and you have to install aurora/fdroid to get apps unless you happen to read chinese (i can't)


[9/17/2023 3:38 AM] kuratius
If you're lucky someone will port pmOS to the a5


[9/17/2023 3:38 AM] kuratius
If you're lucky twice or pay szybet for it you could run inkbox on pmOS


[9/17/2023 3:39 AM] kuratius

[9/17/2023 3:40 AM] tux_linux
Well, unless you want to run inkbox in a VM, porting it to pmOS is probably a no-go as already discussed


[9/17/2023 3:41 AM] kuratius
Dont want /=/no go


[9/17/2023 3:41 AM] tux_linux
Well, \*probably\* I said


[9/17/2023 3:42 AM] tux_linux
But just from the infrastructure standpoint, it's not doable
You would lose like 80% of the features


[9/17/2023 3:43 AM] kuratius
Inkbox relies on old packages, and uses a chroot to run on newer devices with newer kernel/OS right?


[9/17/2023 3:44 AM] tux_linux
Uses chroots for everything

[9/17/2023 3:46 AM] tux_linux
Containerizes everything


[9/17/2023 3:47 AM] kuratius
@dandelion  would still suggest pmOS and then figuring out a way to port a reader if you're set on the a5. Their project has more people, but very few who do eink optimized ui as good as inkbox


[9/17/2023 3:47 AM] kuratius
Then on a pmos install that would probably work too


[9/17/2023 3:47 AM] dandelionkoi
it looks like pmOS is working on the Hisense A9, that's cool


[9/17/2023 3:48 AM] tux_linux
Not with chroots


[9/17/2023 3:49 AM] tux_linux
Would need proot or some other things


[9/17/2023 3:49 AM] tux_linux
It wouldn't let it use UID 0


[9/17/2023 3:50 AM] dandelionkoi
mostly it was a "just wondering" question. sounds like it's difficult/not really possible, and would strain the resources of a small team, so i'm not wondering anymore


[9/17/2023 3:51 AM] tux_linux
Probably better to get it on a supported reader


[9/17/2023 3:51 AM] tux_linux
Like nia


[9/17/2023 3:51 AM] kuratius
I think andi also had some suggested tweaks that would make running inkbox on devices with different kernel seemless, have you had time to look at that?


[9/17/2023 3:51 AM] tux_linux
Not *that* seamless


[9/17/2023 3:52 AM] tux_linux
I looked at it, these are good ideas I don't have time to implement
But it probably wouldn't help as for pmOS
Inkbox lives in its sandbox, it's programmed to think it has the whole room for itself


[9/17/2023 3:52 AM] kuratius
If you spend some time you can probably figure out how to compile koreader or plato for pmOS


[9/17/2023 3:52 AM] tux_linux
Including root


[9/17/2023 3:53 AM] tux_linux
Yes, that will probably work better right away


[9/17/2023 3:53 AM] tux_linux
Koreader already ships Linux appimages


[9/17/2023 3:53 AM] tux_linux
For x86


[9/17/2023 3:55 AM] kuratius
So: get pmOS on highsense a9, then compile koreader for it I guess


[9/17/2023 3:55 AM] kuratius
@dandelion


[9/17/2023 3:55 AM] kuratius
Should get you close to what you want I think?


[9/17/2023 3:55 AM] tux_linux
Maybe just get it on your nia if you like it more


[9/17/2023 3:55 AM] tux_linux
Also there is a koreader Android app


[9/17/2023 3:56 AM] dandelionkoi
yeah, i think the starting place is once my nia arrives, figure out how to open it without breaking it, or see if my friend will help, etcher an sd card, and go from there

{Reactions}
👍 

[9/17/2023 3:57 AM] kuratius
Btw, there is a pmOS port for the nia, if you want to play around with that


[9/17/2023 3:57 AM] kuratius
It's missing an efficient ui like inkbox though


[9/17/2023 3:58 AM] kuratius
Nia has too little ram for xfce to be usable


[9/17/2023 3:58 AM] kuratius
It works, but you dont really have much left for programs


[9/17/2023 3:58 AM] tux_linux
Maybe you can try openbox and tint2?

[9/17/2023 4:00 AM] kuratius

[9/17/2023 4:01 AM] dandelionkoi
i have no programming skills, experience.   i'm at a very basic level, and a slow learner with tech things.  i can usually figure out intermediate level user stuff


[9/17/2023 4:02 AM] kuratius
pmOS is really close to a normal Linux distro

just trying to move out of that ecosystem.  Yeah, it's android.  if I cover the camera when it's locked, and try to unlock it, i get a message, "Do not cover the top of the screen" with a rectangle with the top 3rd shaded


[9/17/2023 4:12 AM] dandelionkoi
it gives you the option to press the power and volume up button to turn that off, but i think i'd have to do that every time i open my phone if i put a sticker on the camera

Hi,
I'm a full stack developer (but with no experience in C++). Recently, I bought a Kobo Clara 2E and would love to support with testing / porting. I commented in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/issues/50

So, first step would be to open the Kobo and flash the current image on the SD card?

Ah, I see where I can do a build for it. I’ll give it a go and poke around, thanks.


[11/29/2023 10:58 AM] andi15701
well, the full reason for all that is: I do not want to change sd cards, so I examine possibilities to multi-boot, so I have inkbox, debian and postmarketos on one card, and to avoid mess with changing partition numbers, I tried to use gpt


[11/29/2023 10:59 AM] andi15701
which causes some mess on inkbox side


[11/29/2023 10:59 AM] [matrix] Szybet

[3/1/2024 7:24 AM] ansraer
Out of curiosity, why exactly do you need the official kernels from Kobo?


[3/1/2024 7:25 AM] ansraer
Afaik every linux kernel should contain information about how it was built in /proc/config.gz, so unless they made massive changes I don't see why you couldn't use that file to build a vanilla kernel with a generic eink driver.


[3/1/2024 7:38 AM] szybet
Because both NXP and kobo do some changes that are horrible hacks most of the time


[3/1/2024 7:38 AM] szybet
And those are weird and device specific


[3/1/2024 7:38 AM] szybet
For older models its worse, for newer its getting better


[3/1/2024 7:39 AM] szybet
If we get a mainline kernel running on a kobo clara 2e or a device that runs it, other devices could also run mainline

@andi : Which model does `kobo,aura2` map to in your kernel? (Remember, Kobo's naming scheme is terrible, there are eleven billion devices with "aura" in the name). The Aura Second Edition?


[3/2/2024 5:04 PM] ninuje
The other contender on an imx6sl would be the Aura H2O (which is often shortened to "H2O" to avoid the Aura mess)

the PCB inscription on those is 37NB-E60QL0+4C0


[3/2/2024 7:20 PM] andi15701
so these refresh issues?


[3/2/2024 7:20 PM] andi15701

[3/2/2024 7:20 PM] andi15701
well, the clara2e is next in my porting queue


[3/2/2024 7:21 PM] szybet
yep


[3/2/2024 7:21 PM] andi15701
the more devices run somehow mainline the easier we can debug things


[3/2/2024 7:21 PM] andi15701
and fix probably issues on several devices


[3/2/2024 7:26 PM] andi15701
clara2e will be interesting because if refresh problems are not there, then it is probably something with the epd pmic


[3/2/2024 7:26 PM] andi15701
so we can narrow things down


[3/2/2024 7:28 PM] dferrg_30526
That PMIC is TPS65186?

65185


[3/2/2024 7:28 PM] andi15701
yes, that one is for the display


[3/2/2024 7:28 PM] andi15701
clara2e has a sy7636


[3/2/2024 7:30 PM] dferrg_30526
I tried it for a project some years ago, it was very problematic


[3/2/2024 7:30 PM] andi15701
there is something near mainline for the clara2e too


[3/2/2024 7:31 PM] dferrg_30526
i don't remember if mine was 65185 or 65186


[3/2/2024 8:00 PM] andi15701
clara hd vendor vs. mainline, there are bugs fixed in mainline and later also fixed in the vendor kernel, and there are bugs in the near-mainline kernel but not in the vendor kernel.


[3/2/2024 11:38 PM] ninuje
Yeah, curious how the Clara 2E's PMIC would fare on mainline, because it's.... fairly fucked up on vendor.


[3/2/2024 11:39 PM] ninuje
Yeah, that one was a doozy. Same PCB ID, *completely* different SoC.

but again there is A and B. Difference is the epd pmic, and the one in b was afaik never forward ported to anything near mainline. And I have b 😦


[3/23/2024 10:53 AM] andi15701
for a there is some older mainline port although it is a bit messed up regarding the regulators


[3/23/2024 10:55 AM] andi15701
I think cpufreq is not working properly on any kobo kernel with the rohm pmic


[3/30/2024 12:54 AM] carnivorous_snow
Greetings everyone. Is this the place to ask if Inkbox might possibly work with Kobo Aura H2O?


[3/30/2024 12:56 AM] szybet
yes but you would need to port it you need time, linux knowledge is welcome documentation are the threads in #porting you are welcome


[3/30/2024 12:56 AM] szybet
and hello btw


[3/30/2024 1:00 AM] carnivorous_snow
Thanks man. I'll have to look into it. I'm actually not sure what to do with my unit. I got it as a gift, but it had been cleaned with a damp cloth.. damp. It's supposed to be water proof. Well water got in, and the top left quadrant of the screen won't register touch. So as of yet, I'm unable to simply install the regular Kobo OS as I can't select English as the language. XD. Because half of width and half of height doesn't work, I do wonder if it is some sort of firmware glitch with the version I've been trying to install - which I have to look up.


[3/30/2024 1:00 AM] carnivorous_snow
You're familiar, do you play Soldat? Or do I know you from somewhere else.


[3/30/2024 1:01 AM] szybet
Nope, i dont play games much


[3/30/2024 1:02 AM] carnivorous_snow
Hmm, must be some programming community I had joined once upon a time. I basically deleted all my Discord and left. But rejoined just for this. 😛


[3/30/2024 1:02 AM] szybet
idk, inkbox won't resolve hardware issues but im sure you could use it at least to some extend without the part of the screen


[3/30/2024 1:02 AM] carnivorous_snow
That's what I'm hoping


[3/30/2024 1:02 AM] szybet
idk maybe even a photo frame, second screen, news agregator or anything


[3/30/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
a small server


[3/30/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
whatever really


[3/30/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
its a pure linux device then


[3/30/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
just a underpowered one


[3/30/2024 1:04 AM] szybet
maybe, idk im not that active on discord


[3/30/2024 1:04 AM] carnivorous_snow
It will work as an e-reader, just so long as I can select books, get to settings and flip pages with the bottom half of screen.


[3/30/2024 1:04 AM] szybet
koreader will do the trick i think


[3/30/2024 1:05 AM] szybet
it has some bad ui but i think its pretty resilient to such things


[3/30/2024 1:05 AM] szybet
ping me in the porting thread if i dont respond normally, discord threads sometimes dont show up


[3/30/2024 1:06 AM] carnivorous_snow
Ok will do. Thank you so much. 🙂

anyone here thought about a pinenote port?


[4/1/2024 1:19 AM] szybet
We talked with pinenote, they dont have a real pinenote to give us but aprototype without a touchscreen


[4/1/2024 1:19 AM] szybet
and we arent doing it because we focus on other things for now


[4/1/2024 1:19 AM] szybet
eg. no time ;o


[4/1/2024 1:42 AM] exparrot
Ah yep. I’ve got a pine note sitting here


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] szybet
huh


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] szybet
are you a developer?


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] exparrot
Yeah


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] szybet
then you could port inkbox


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[4/1/2024 1:43 AM] exparrot
I ported koreader a while back, kind of tempting to try inkbox instead


[4/1/2024 1:44 AM] szybet
inkbox will give you access to a few other apps


[4/1/2024 1:44 AM] szybet
the rest is not perfect


[4/1/2024 1:44 AM] exparrot
Yeah nice


[4/1/2024 1:44 AM] exparrot
I wrote some writing software for the pine note too but there are some driver issues still


[4/1/2024 1:44 AM] szybet
the system if between "kind of a rpi with eink screen" and "a full edged eink os" but we are working on it

{Reactions}
👌 

[4/1/2024 1:45 AM] szybet
sad


[4/1/2024 1:45 AM] szybet
we use fbink mostly


[4/1/2024 1:45 AM] exparrot
I gotta head out but cool to have found this  project. I’ll be back at some point


[4/1/2024 1:46 AM] szybet
cool


[4/1/2024 1:46 AM] szybet
we plan to develop inkbox a lot in the summer


[4/1/2024 1:46 AM] szybet
and later


[4/1/2024 1:46 AM] szybet
now its a pause really


[4/1/2024 1:46 AM] szybet
school and things


[4/1/2024 1:48 AM] tux_linux
remember i have summer classes until july 17th


[4/1/2024 1:48 AM] szybet
Im talking about me


[4/1/2024 1:48 AM] tux_linux
ok


[4/3/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
a new toy

[4/3/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
for dumping voltages of the bd71879


[4/3/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
found in the nia c


[4/3/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
clara2e


[4/3/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
some libra2


[4/3/2024 9:12 AM] andi15701
so run it on every device


[4/3/2024 9:12 AM] andi15701
which uses that regulator to understand whether there is something unexpected done in kernel


[4/3/2024 9:13 AM] andi15701
you need to specify the bus number the pmic is on


[4/3/2024 9:33 AM] szybet
You could detect it automatically i think?


[4/3/2024 9:33 AM] szybet
But thats very cool anyway


[4/3/2024 9:34 AM] szybet
such toys if done properly could enavle us gathering info on devices that arw not yet supported via Quillwrite


[4/3/2024 2:20 PM] andi15701
well, i was just too lazy to do that


[4/3/2024 2:20 PM] andi15701
```root@bookworm:~# BUSNUM=`echo /sys/bus/i2c/devices/?-004b | sed 's|.*/\(.\).*|\1|'`
root@bookworm:~# echo $BUSNUM
2
root@bookworm:~#```


[4/3/2024 2:58 PM] szybet
huh, awesome


[4/3/2024 2:58 PM] szybet
so instead of booting uboot just run this?


[4/3/2024 3:08 PM] andi15701
run this on any device with bd71879 in it


[4/3/2024 3:08 PM] andi15701
when it is running normally


[4/3/2024 3:09 PM] andi15701
to find out how the regulators are really set up


[4/3/2024 3:30 PM] andi15701
to put that into any devicetree or verify that the vendor kernel sources match at least what is actually running in case of regulator configuration


[4/3/2024 4:14 PM] andi15701
uboot hacks would be to detect board versions to load the correct devicetree (+ hwconfig binaries if kobo vendor kernel is run)
