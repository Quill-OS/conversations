[6/12/2022 1:40 AM] tux_linux
first, why would you post nsfw content on a server that is meant for developing an OS for eReaders?


[6/12/2022 1:41 AM] raycast_
Linux porn


[6/12/2022 1:41 AM] tux_linux
please post some and I will decide accordingly (and not ban you)
nsfw content is not something I like
but I want to see what you mean by 'linux porn'

@tux-linux do you know how to upload a kernel when download mode is on?


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
i think no


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
depends on this


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
It's a big risk...


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
the risk is only when the cpu things the bootloader is working and its actually not working


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
then yes, big problem


[9/26/2022 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah


[9/26/2022 9:24 PM] szybet
but very unlikely


[9/26/2022 9:24 PM] the.mightydill
Then something about fastboot...


[9/26/2022 9:24 PM] the.mightydill

[9/26/2022 11:26 PM] the.mightydill
Especially since my parents are very strict

I'm 15m away from Montreal


[11/29/2022 1:17 AM] aryetis
If I ever got bored of working where I am at right now I'll probably try to move to either : valve, montreal, japan... Cause I sure don't want to ever live in Paris.


[11/29/2022 1:18 AM] aryetis
So yeah canada is on the "why not" list. But again, it's probably not gonna happen for some years. But if it ever does I'll let you know :p

Why are you scared of software that takes 800 peta bytes of human know how and regurgitates it in its own sequence of words?


[12/3/2022 12:06 PM] nonasuomy
Ask it how to easily make a lot of money


[12/3/2022 12:07 PM] nonasuomy
Ask how to always win at trading stocks


[12/3/2022 12:08 PM] nonasuomy
Ask it what stocks should you pick

[12/3/2022 12:46 PM] nonasuomy
you look at it like a caveman looked at fire for the first time. instead of looking at it like a chemical combustion.


[12/3/2022 12:46 PM] szybet
fire won't replace humanity work in 10 years... ;p


[12/3/2022 12:47 PM] nonasuomy
It's technically been around for 10 years and it's still basically the same so...


[12/3/2022 12:47 PM] szybet
go into web archive and send me a conversation with an ai so good than this


[12/3/2022 12:47 PM] nonasuomy
It's already eaten all the human data what is left for it to get better with?


[12/3/2022 12:48 PM] szybet
you dont seem to understand, with your logic, why image generators were non existing basically 3 years ago?


[12/3/2022 12:49 PM] nonasuomy
The organization was founded in San Francisco in late 2015 2 more years and it will be 10 years old.


[12/3/2022 12:50 PM] nonasuomy
They existed just not publicly.


[12/3/2022 12:50 PM] szybet
...

find a tweet from 2019 saying "this image was ai generated :D"


[12/3/2022 12:51 PM] nonasuomy
Why bother I look at research papers all day.


[12/3/2022 12:52 PM] nonasuomy
twitters just a lump of slow slop put your finger on the pulse of information.


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
just an example


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
following your logic, skynet exists now but its on a private network?


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] nonasuomy
yes


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
im a bit scared of the progress ai is making, and in your opinion its just regular as fire


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
nice


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] nonasuomy
fire can burn you.


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] nonasuomy
get ready.


[12/3/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
we can both agree :D


[12/3/2022 12:54 PM] nonasuomy
Essentially though you will be dead before any of this matters and impact you from living.


[12/3/2022 12:55 PM] nonasuomy
So nothing really to worry about in the hear and now for you.


[12/3/2022 12:55 PM] szybet
i know, thats why i get exited to try the best public technology of my time


[12/3/2022 12:55 PM] nonasuomy
you can maybe worry about your kids not being able to breath the atmosphere on earth though.


[12/3/2022 12:55 PM] szybet
i dont plan kids


[12/3/2022 12:56 PM] nonasuomy
Essentially if we want to keep living on earth we will have to assimilate technology to be able to take our final breath.


[12/3/2022 12:56 PM] szybet
no, overpopulation is the problem


[12/3/2022 12:56 PM] szybet
just stop breeding like animals


[12/3/2022 12:56 PM] nonasuomy
Not many of your generation do as to another reason why the humans are done for in your understanding.

i dont understand this sentence


[12/3/2022 12:57 PM] szybet
propably because of my english


[12/3/2022 12:57 PM] nonasuomy
Overpopulation is not a problem we are actually in a bad spiral of population collapse.


[12/3/2022 12:57 PM] szybet
only in developed countries


[12/3/2022 12:58 PM] nonasuomy
Everyone on earth would have to have 2.1 kids to prevent it.


[12/3/2022 12:58 PM] nonasuomy
We are all dying too quickly.


[12/3/2022 12:59 PM] nonasuomy
Even in developing countries.


[12/3/2022 12:59 PM] szybet
70~ years too less?


[12/3/2022 12:59 PM] nonasuomy
yes.


[12/3/2022 12:59 PM] nonasuomy
most of those 70yr olds do nothing for producing children.


[12/3/2022 1:00 PM] nonasuomy
If you look at age vs productive child producing you will understand how the collapse works.


[12/3/2022 1:00 PM] szybet
i understand


[12/3/2022 1:01 PM] nonasuomy
It takes far to long to create a functioning human.


[12/3/2022 1:01 PM] szybet
but the solution isin't rising the population forever


[12/3/2022 1:01 PM] nonasuomy
And then they stop production for way too many years.


[12/3/2022 1:01 PM] szybet
bruh, maybe


[12/3/2022 1:01 PM] szybet
naybe


[12/3/2022 1:02 PM] szybet
a humans goal shouldn't be "rush rush be productive then die"


[12/3/2022 1:02 PM] szybet
just live a good life


[12/3/2022 1:03 PM] nonasuomy
You would have to basically constantly produce children all your life to prevent collapse.


[12/3/2022 1:03 PM] szybet
how do you expact that, 15 milion people soon?


[12/3/2022 1:04 PM] nonasuomy
There won't be any life to have a good life when there is nothing left for you to have a life with.


[12/3/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
maybe maybe


[12/3/2022 1:05 PM] nonasuomy
The quantity is not the problem. The replacement is the problem.


[12/3/2022 1:05 PM] nonasuomy
Also if we want to explore outside of our earth we would need to produce a billion fold what we do now.


[12/3/2022 1:06 PM] nonasuomy
That is where proper regenerative ai will come in to play.


[12/3/2022 1:07 PM] nonasuomy
We are the bootloader for it to explore the galaxy.


[12/3/2022 1:07 PM] szybet
maybe focusing on better redistributing of goods, abanding wars, conflicts would fix the issue?...


[12/3/2022 1:07 PM] nonasuomy
We are not doing a great job but hopefully we make it before we collapse the earths environment.


[12/3/2022 1:08 PM] szybet
~~hope~~


[12/3/2022 1:09 PM] nonasuomy
You can only fix that with a lobotomy to remove our lizard brain parts.

were at a plateau of information watch some stuff from peter theil where he talks about how hard it's getting to find smart people any more to build bigger and better things so without Ai to generate new interesting things we won't be inspired to do much of anything.


[12/3/2022 1:14 PM] szybet
yes thats propably true


[12/3/2022 1:14 PM] nonasuomy
You should be looking at generative production and be thinking how can I use this to create the next level. Not lets run in fear.


[12/3/2022 1:15 PM] nonasuomy
If it kills you, so what. What was your purpose anyways.

[12/3/2022 1:15 PM] szybet
fear that 1% of the population will use ai, and the rest will be fucked becauce they are not needed, yes

It will only kill you if you are useless... so make yourself less useless.

as here are many canadians, I am a bit wondering about some canadian phone numbers  in this format: 1-124-areacode-....


[12/29/2022 2:47 PM] andi15701
what is the 124 doing there


[12/29/2022 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
never seen that


[12/29/2022 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
124 is probably the areacode


[12/29/2022 9:35 PM] andi15701
the next three numbers are a sane areacode. I was a bit alerted because the numbers are a bit dangerous here in Europe. 112 basically = 911 So I was a bit afraid because my mum is hearing impaired. So if that number is carelessly entered without the international prefix (=00 here), that might be an emergency call and my mum would probably get confused and could not explain. Who knows what gets triggered then... So I immediatedly prefixed the 00 to avoid such trouble


[12/30/2022 8:59 PM] szybet
fun fact: all ( i didn't found one ) online seconds to minutes converter doesnt work, the simply divide by 60 which doesnt give the correct answer of 4,10 in this example, soxi does it right

@Szybet framework AMD laptop, steamdeck could be considerations

Ryzen APUs with rdna2/3 can mostly replace dedicated GPUs for light gaming


[7/13/2023 7:59 PM] kuratius
Framework 16 will come with a swappable gpu


[7/13/2023 8:00 PM] kuratius
Framework 13 has a 7840H or 7840U


[7/13/2023 8:00 PM] kuratius
Mendocino laptops are super cheap, but the gpu is 1/4 as good as in the steam deck

framework 16, if reasonable price i want it

as for amd and integrated graphics - CAD software wont like it


[7/13/2023 8:02 PM] kuratius
Possibly 1/3, the clck is higher but less compute units, so still weaker


[7/13/2023 8:03 PM] kuratius
Then you have to use nvidia and it doesn't have super great linux drivers


[7/13/2023 8:03 PM] kuratius
Amd integratred vs amd dedicated isn't that different

Your cad software doesn't work on amd cards? That is weird, I would double check thst assumption

they are integrated in the cpu and it would be a downgrade compared to 1050 Ti

Malbolge
Malbolge () is a public domain esoteric programming language invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, named after the eighth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno, the Malebolge. It was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive 'crazy operation', base-three arithmetic, and self-altering code. It builds on the difficulty ...

From what I can tell the idea is to provide an easy way to convert arbitrary C programs to Malbolge

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/24/2023 6:28 AM] kuratius
You could probably design a language that is cryptographically secure enough to make it impossible to program in without brute forcing every output+input , but I would argue that that isn't a language anymore, it's just an encryption mechanism.
If the program halts then you have a mapping of inputs to finite outputs.
If if doesn't halt then you have a mapping from inputs to infinite outputs.
All programs should result in deterministic behavior.
So the entire thing is more like a very weird one-time pad than a programming language.
The infinite sequence thing reminds me a bit of p-adic numbers, but it's late and I can't tell if that's a useful concept for it.

no animations / ui?


[7/29/2023 7:22 PM] kuratius
animations can be offloaded to the device that loads the page, and the UI isnt going to be very complex. Even images only need to be loaded once, then they get cached by the client


[7/29/2023 7:22 PM] kuratius
and you can completely offload the UI part into an app anyway

as an example: New World has a skill that deals damage to x players in the aoe every 0.25 seconds, and if 50 players are in that aoe the server and client start chugging
it's literally just doing a subtraction 200 times a second


[7/29/2023 7:28 PM] kuratius
I remember reading that it's related to their netcode being garbage that sends the entire world/player state for subtraction of health, but that's equally stupid

in other news, apparently it's looking good for the room temperature superconductor, just produces really shitty yields so most the material isnt superconducting


[8/3/2023 8:03 AM] szybet
really? from where is this info


[8/3/2023 8:03 AM] szybet
eevblog roasted it


[8/3/2023 8:05 AM] kuratius
there's some papers with simulations that suggest it might be superconducting and people are getting reproduction of some of the behavior


[8/3/2023 8:05 AM] szybet
still, not confirmed kinda


[8/3/2023 8:06 AM] kuratius
the thing is, even if it actually is superconducting, it might be hard to manufacture and/or hard to use


[8/3/2023 8:06 AM] szybet
lol they said its easy in both


[8/3/2023 8:07 AM] kuratius
Iiirc the simulation said it's only superconducting in some parts of the crystal lattice that are under the right stress


[8/3/2023 8:07 AM] szybet
so, pressure is needed? lol...


[8/3/2023 8:07 AM] kuratius
so you cant actually use it for anything other than meissner effect knockoffs


[8/3/2023 8:08 AM] kuratius
but I havent read the paper


[8/3/2023 8:08 AM] kuratius
maybe, yes

[8/10/2023 12:56 PM] kuratius
you can turn on software rendering, technically


[8/10/2023 12:56 PM] kuratius
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./lapce


[8/10/2023 12:57 PM] kuratius
the issue is not having a gpu, it's supporting a specific openGL version


[8/10/2023 12:57 PM] kuratius
which is imo bad design because you dont need fancy graphics for 2d stuff


[8/10/2023 12:57 PM] szybet
so it needs opengl?


[8/10/2023 12:57 PM] szybet
so no kobo xorg?


[8/10/2023 12:57 PM] kuratius
it can run with llvmpipe


[8/10/2023 12:58 PM] szybet
doesnt tell me much


[8/10/2023 12:58 PM] kuratius
probably not unless you want to install a bunch of extra packages


[8/10/2023 12:58 PM] kuratius
llvmpipe is a cpu based opengl backend basically

Sorry I don't think I follow. Are you saying that you are fine with having a dependency? Or is xkbcommon somehow related to lapce?

I guess it is a lapce dependency? dont remember it well

[8/10/2023 1:02 PM] kuratius
oh so it is


[8/10/2023 1:03 PM] kuratius
anyway lapce will fail quietly if it doesnt find an openGL renderer instead of switching to software or giving an error


[8/10/2023 1:03 PM] kuratius
I think there is an option you can change to not make it fail quietly


[8/10/2023 1:03 PM] kuratius
or you can force to use a software renderer


[8/10/2023 1:03 PM] kuratius
have you tested it before?


[8/10/2023 1:04 PM] szybet
nope


[8/10/2023 1:04 PM] kuratius
I did at one point on my rpi, but it took several hours compile
Performance was acceptable even with software rendering, though I didnt really do anything heavy


[8/10/2023 1:05 PM] szybet
cross compilators exist?


[8/10/2023 1:05 PM] kuratius
also can only compile on 64 bit arm because there is apparently a dependency that is borked


[8/10/2023 1:05 PM] kuratius
I know but I wasnt using the rpi for anything and I could do other stuff meanwhile so I didnt care enough


[8/10/2023 1:06 PM] kuratius
also now I wonder if rust targets baseline or native cpu features


[8/10/2023 1:06 PM] kuratius
by default I mean


[8/10/2023 1:06 PM] kuratius
if it targets baseline I should probably change that behavior for low power targets lol


[8/10/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
to my knowledge at least for kobo's, no


[8/10/2023 1:07 PM] kuratius
so it targets what? baseline?

I dont have a 3d printer so printing my own is a bit expensive


[1/9/2024 5:55 PM] szybet
should be not more than a few euros in your local print farm


[1/9/2024 5:55 PM] szybet
even less


[1/9/2024 5:56 PM] kuratius
I asked a local 3d printing service for a case for an rpi, they quoted me 90 €


[1/9/2024 5:56 PM] kuratius
was ~3 years ago

ask on your local facebook if anyone has a 3d printer and will print a few grams for 10 euros


[1/9/2024 5:57 PM] kuratius
and they probably most got companies

then I dont have good advice for you other than trying to export to a pdf or something or doing postprocessing manually


[1/23/2024 12:33 AM] kuratius
you'd have to write a parser, replace relevant parts, and write the thing to a file again


[1/23/2024 12:33 AM] kuratius
you can do some trickery with command line tools for post processing, like if the cropping is bad and whatnot


[1/23/2024 12:34 AM] kuratius
there are autocrop tools


[1/23/2024 12:34 AM] kuratius
but then you cant change things like font size easily


[1/23/2024 12:35 AM] kuratius
there's probably a way to daisy chain format conversions that fixes that somewhat?


[1/23/2024 12:35 AM] kuratius
like if the html isnt semantic, and for example kindle uses a fundamentally different format, then converting to kindle and back to epub probably fixes it?

but you'd lose some things

it's a header setting in calibre somewhere

it's intended to be applied to the entire book

like imagine setting a standard for a book that can be overriden locally if the book chooses


[1/23/2024 4:10 PM] kuratius
if you also add the override qualifier to the standard setting it'd probably ignore the local version

because if it could compile to C you'd have rust safety guarantees on any platform with a c compiler

I assume is hardware related. And I am not that savvy checking if there is any shorts in the board

I think zig is better than rust just for the reduced binary size and less complex syntax.
I like C adjacent-languages because with too much syntax you have no idea what kind of assembly might be generated


[2/3/2024 9:02 PM] kuratius
like, Rust just seems like C++ with extra heads and longer compile times to me


[2/3/2024 9:03 PM] kuratius
for safety you can probably just use zig's release-safe mode anyway


[2/3/2024 9:05 PM] szybet
Rust also targets c compilers in some weird way - plato uses kobo toolchain in some way by adding it to cargo config

Dont ask me how it works, its doing something with it


[2/3/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
Rust compiler is worth it.


[2/3/2024 9:07 PM] szybet
Rust has sometimes complex sytnax but its still good

Yep, zig is more minimal but binary size is not really important in those days


[2/3/2024 9:43 PM] szybet
rust on embedded is doing great


[2/3/2024 9:44 PM] szybet
~~libraries are missing for various external chips~~ but if you get it to work then holy shit it's faster, more efficient, less power consuming and more


[2/3/2024 9:45 PM] szybet
and thats only the beginning


[2/3/2024 9:47 PM] kuratius
wish mozilla hadnt dumped it


[2/3/2024 9:48 PM] szybet
it's not a c replacement as for "It's minimal, hard to use, cant do anything without some libraries" It's a c replacement as for "Should be used **everywhere** as C was in it's peak, **It's great**"


[2/3/2024 9:49 PM] szybet
rust in embedded, kernel, apps, browser, networking, services - **yes**
where c in apps, browser, services is non existing nowadays

I’m thinking of buying a kobo to try out this project. Which one do you all recommend


[3/16/2024 8:01 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Kobo glo hd or kobo nia


[3/16/2024 8:02 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Also define "try the project"


[3/16/2024 8:13 AM] curley2012
Hands on with inkbox


[3/16/2024 8:15 AM] curley2012
Idk I have never owned a kobo. Just something affordable but also I would actually want to use


[3/16/2024 8:29 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet
Inkbox is experimental in some aspect, keep that in mind


[3/16/2024 8:30 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet
Then the most affordable is a kobo glo / kobo glo hd but used, can be get at like that 20$


[3/16/2024 8:30 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Or its tolino counterpart


[3/16/2024 8:30 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Used tolinos are cheap too but you would need to make sure its compatible with inkbox


[3/16/2024 8:31 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet
Depending on what you want or what to expect, you may be disappointed


[3/16/2024 8:32 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Oh also kobo mini is the cheapest probably but its the "worst" model


[3/16/2024 8:32 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Support for it on inkbox is questionable, you would need to fix a few shell scripts for sure


[3/16/2024 8:33 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Thats it I think


[3/16/2024 8:33 AM] [matrix] Szybet
I should add it to the faq


[3/17/2024 5:14 AM] curley2012
I don’t mind it being experimental. I just like the idea of having a free software ereader.


[3/17/2024 5:17 AM] curley2012
I live in the US so I would have to buy a device off of eBay as they are not really widely available here, especially used. Is the Kobo Aura N236 supported well? I can get that one for a reasonable price.

I figured out a way to run this with full accuracy with no performance hit hehe
just requires a long mult, you can shift the operands such that the leading 23 bits of the result are all in the Hi register


[3/19/2024 2:18 AM] kuratius

I'd look at models with a long term memory feature, and if you want something that runs locally probably look at mistral's mixture of experts stuff. Yes you can do your own fine tune on models (e.g. NovelAI offers automatic fine tune as a feature if you give it a text body to work with, they call the feature "modules", but their stuff is geared towards making stories )
>image generation on AMD gpus, easy to use?

This one I can actually answer, I've set up stable diffusion on fedora on an amd gpu before. The guide I followed had a lot of errors but it worked in the end. I dont really use it because it makes my gpu sound like it's dying because the workload is uneven,  gives coil whine issues.



Only thing idk about is voice cloning on amd gpus, last I checked that was difficult to do.
