[1/29/2022 12:06 AM] andi15701
how many buttons?


[1/29/2022 12:06 AM] tux_linux
Reset and power


[1/29/2022 12:06 AM] tux_linux
There's probably a hall sensor and other things but I can't really check evtest now


[1/29/2022 12:07 AM] andi15701
i have already the fcc internal photos pdf here

[1/29/2022 12:09 AM] andi15701
so, 1 button, probably 1 hall sensor, 1 led?


[1/29/2022 12:09 AM] tux_linux
yes


[1/29/2022 12:10 AM] andi15701
everything else looks the same as for the Shine 2 HD


[1/29/2022 12:10 AM] tux_linux
Well, with the device tree provided for that device, we should have some basic things already working


[1/29/2022 12:15 AM] andi15701
I would expect no missing drivers


[1/29/2022 12:15 AM] andi15701
in my branches for it


[1/29/2022 12:15 AM] andi15701
so just the devicetree

[1/29/2022 12:17 AM] andi15701
I would expect that suspend is not working


[1/29/2022 12:17 AM] andi15701
with the old one


[1/29/2022 12:17 AM] andi15701
and near-mainline-kernel


[1/29/2022 12:17 AM] tux_linux
suspend of what?


[1/29/2022 12:18 AM] andi15701
echo mem >/sys/power/state


[1/29/2022 12:18 AM] tux_linux
oh


[1/29/2022 12:18 AM] tux_linux
You would expect that suspend would not be possible with near-mainline kernel?


[1/29/2022 12:19 AM] andi15701
stone-age u-boot + near-mainline kernel


[1/29/2022 12:19 AM] tux_linux
But is U-Boot not overwritten in RAM after loading and starting the kernel?


[1/29/2022 12:19 AM] tux_linux
What would it have to do with this?


[1/29/2022 12:20 AM] andi15701
I do not fully understand that yet, I guess there are different expectation about who sets up self-refresh of the RAM  and how


[1/29/2022 12:21 AM] tux_linux
Probably that there are differences between the way it is handled on sunxi and imx


[1/29/2022 12:23 AM] andi15701
basically the u-boot also sets up hardware stuff for its own purposes


[1/29/2022 12:23 AM] andi15701
and sometimes the kernel expects a certain state


[1/29/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
oh


[1/29/2022 12:23 AM] andi15701
which is not good


[1/29/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[1/29/2022 12:24 AM] andi15701
but I think just use the new u-boot and that's it


[1/29/2022 12:24 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[1/29/2022 12:24 AM] andi15701
but for first testing, we do not need suspend


[1/29/2022 12:24 AM] tux_linux
no, it's fine


[1/29/2022 12:25 AM] andi15701
and when you set /sys/power/mem_sleep to something other than deep


[1/29/2022 12:25 AM] andi15701
it also works

[1/29/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
I did not know about that sysfs node


[1/29/2022 12:26 AM] tux_linux
only knew `state` and `state-extended`


[1/29/2022 12:26 AM] andi15701
state-extended is kobo-specific


[1/29/2022 12:26 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[1/29/2022 12:26 AM] tux_linux
They do some pretty agressive sleep when the UI is idle in Nickel that's for sure


[1/29/2022 12:27 AM] tux_linux
not always fun to be locked out of serial console


[1/29/2022 12:28 AM] andi15701

I might have gotten a bit too far, the first partition actually starts at sector 30720, I thought it would be 49152 as it was for the N236, but apparently not

andi1, if you have any pointers about this since you got it working on a newer kernel, it'd be nice...
dhd is truly, truly, truly a nightmare


[2/8/2022 3:43 AM] tux_linux
Meanwhile, I'll try with other nvram configs and firmwares...


[2/8/2022 4:10 AM] tux_linux
Also, I'm sad. Kernel randomly faults and prints a trace at random times after touching the screen while the QPA is running.
Not sure what to do, if it's the QPA's problem, the kernel's or both.
But anyways, that's a whole different issue


[2/8/2022 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Ok, hopeful fact is that the kernel traces/panics are practically nonexistent when X11 is started at boot, UI is super stable and never crashes, to the best of what I've observed.
Current behavior is that it only happens when getting out of an X11 app, thus restarting Qt and InkBox UI. Sometimes it is "non-blocking", meaning it doesn't panic, but hangs when trying to reboot/poweroff the device (can also render device unstable by triggering nonsensical I/O errors at random places, probably by overwriting memory areas that it should not), or "blocking", where it completely panics or keeps outputting trace information on the serial console.

Ok, progress on the Wi-Fi. Not fully working, but it's better.
I had to take the `rtecdc.bin.WC121A2` firmware instead. I wonder if this could make it work on the imx507s too.
NVRAM file is `nvram-E60Q90.txt`.
Now it complains about not being able to scan anything.
And it really can't, since the `iwlist` command used for scanning doesn't work either.

A newer platform plugin apparently fixes the kernel panics/traces bug. Which is awesome.


[5/17/2022 5:32 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction  + @NiLuJe : I've got this strange bug sometimes (not only) when waking up from sleep mode on the Glo HD.
The two small rectangles at the top are updated at the same time if there is an event that does it, but the big viewport is frozen.
The only fix I know about is to relaunch the binary (i.e., platform plugin).
Any ideas why it does that?

In here, the LED, when the `ioctl(light, CM_nLED, 1);` ioctl is performed on it, behaves like that
Is there a way to make it light up still?


[8/2/2022 6:08 AM] tux_linux
(@andi, sorry for bothering you, but I could use some help 🙂 
also, it could be useful for improving a future device tree source)


[8/2/2022 12:59 PM] ninuje
By not using the ioctl and using the lit sysfs node manually instead? :o)


[8/2/2022 1:07 PM] ninuje
`CM_nLED` doesn't touch the right LED channel (it touches the "green" one while you apparently you want the "red" channel (ignore the color name, it's fairly meaningless) for a "connected" hint), but try sending a `CM_LED_BLINK` 0 first anyway?

TL;DR: There's a reason Nickel doesn't use those 😉

a 2 color diode? glo hd is the best ereader then


[8/2/2022 1:30 PM] ninuje
It's a historical quirk of the ntx led driver


[8/2/2022 1:30 PM] ninuje
each channel is named after a color


[8/2/2022 1:30 PM] ninuje
doesn't necessarily reflects reality


[8/2/2022 3:39 PM] tux_linux
There isn't


[8/2/2022 3:41 PM] tux_linux
CM_LED_BLINK does exactly what it says on the tin
Even if put before/after the other ioctl call


[8/2/2022 3:41 PM] tux_linux
Touch has a 4-color LED


[8/2/2022 3:45 PM] tux_linux
```
kobo:/sys# find /sys | grep led
/sys/devices/platform/gpio-keys/disabled_keys
/sys/devices/platform/gpio-keys/disabled_switches
/sys/devices/platform/gpio-keys/input/input0/capabilities/led
/sys/devices/virtual/input/input1/capabilities/led
/sys/module/usbhid/parameters/ignoreled
kobo:/sys# find /sys | grep LED
kobo:/sys#
```


[8/2/2022 4:00 PM] tux_linux
There is a light node though, but it doesn't do anything


[8/2/2022 4:01 PM] tux_linux
`pmic_light.1`


[8/2/2022 4:35 PM] szybet
even cooler


[8/2/2022 4:35 PM] szybet
i want an rgb led on a ereader


[8/2/2022 4:39 PM] tux_linux
it is rgb


[8/2/2022 4:39 PM] tux_linux
plus white when you combine all 3

[8/2/2022 4:41 PM] tux_linux
admittedly, he could have used an easier method than JTAG...


[8/2/2022 4:42 PM] szybet
sooo cool


[8/2/2022 8:25 PM] ninuje
It's *really* called `lit`, that wasn't a typo on my part 😉


[8/2/2022 8:25 PM] tux_linux
Yes, I know, it doesn't work


[8/2/2022 8:25 PM] ninuje
`static DEVICE_ATTR(lit, 0644, lit_info, lit_ctl);` @ `drivers/misc/ntx_misc_light.c`


[8/2/2022 8:25 PM] tux_linux
it's in `pmic_light.1`


[8/2/2022 8:25 PM] ninuje
Syntax is clunky as fuck, though


[8/2/2022 8:26 PM] tux_linux
you can't just write 1 or 0 to it?


[8/2/2022 8:26 PM] ninuje
No


[8/2/2022 8:26 PM] tux_linux
oh

[8/2/2022 8:28 PM] tux_linux
it doesn't work, or I made a typo while sending commands


[8/2/2022 8:29 PM] tux_linux
are we talking about the same thing?
```
kobo:/sys/devices/platform/pmic_light.1# ls
driver     lit        modalias   power      subsystem  uevent
kobo:/sys/devices/platform/pmic_light.1#
```


[8/2/2022 8:30 PM] ninuje
I'd strace a nickel startup, like the comments say, that's a Mk.7+ command stream


[8/2/2022 8:30 PM] ninuje
It's quite possible the Glo requires tweaking a different channel


[8/2/2022 8:30 PM] tux_linux
nickel just turns off the light at start up


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
we can already do that


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] ninuje
That's enough to tell you which channels to fiddle


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
`CM_LIGHT_BLINK`


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
but ok


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] ninuje
(I've never seen it use the ioctl on my devices, FWIW)


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
it behaves a bit strange but it turns the led off


[8/2/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
so I guess it's fine


[8/2/2022 9:07 PM] tux_linux
To turn it off

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-5226A.txt


[8/2/2022 9:08 PM] tux_linux
it's the same as yours it seems
but it turns off the led
I want to turn it on


[8/2/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
```
/sys/devices/platform/pmic_light.1 # echo "ch 4" > lit
/sys/devices/platform/pmic_light.1 # echo "cur 1" > lit
/sys/devices/platform/pmic_light.1 # echo "dc 63" > lit
```
Ok, when using this, the light briefly turns on and then shuts off


[8/3/2022 12:02 AM] ninuje
That's... interesting 😄


[8/3/2022 12:03 AM] ninuje
I do remember a host of weird little issues on older devices, and, AFAICT, that option is gone from Nickel on said wonky devices


[8/3/2022 12:03 AM] tux_linux
Is there any way to keep it still on? I can modify kernel code


[8/3/2022 12:03 AM] tux_linux
U-Boot at least manages to do it without a problem


[8/3/2022 12:04 AM] ninuje
`arch/arm/mach-mx6/mx6sl_ntx_io.c` & `drivers/misc/ntx_misc_light.c`


[8/3/2022 12:06 AM] tux_linux
ntx_io is probably a lost cause


[8/3/2022 12:14 AM] ninuje
it's where some of the led backend lives on older kernels, though


[8/3/2022 12:14 AM] ninuje
which doesn't excuse the mess ;p


[8/3/2022 12:14 AM] tux_linux
it works on the Aura SE fine


[8/3/2022 12:14 AM] tux_linux
which is just a few months older than the Glo HD


[8/3/2022 12:16 AM] ninuje
Never looked at an Aura SE kernel, and apparently I don't even have it on hand, so I can't even diff it ;p


[8/3/2022 12:17 AM] tux_linux
you can go look in the inkbox kernel repo


[8/3/2022 12:17 AM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/tree/master/kernel/linux-3.0.35-n236


[8/24/2022 10:30 PM] andi15701
hmm, did you try tolino shine2hd kernel and backlight?


[8/24/2022 10:30 PM] tux_linux
No, you're talking about the mainline one?


[8/24/2022 10:31 PM] andi15701
yes


[8/24/2022 10:31 PM] andi15701
I heard that people have just booted the Tolino Shine2HD stuff from pmOS on the Glo HD


[8/24/2022 10:31 PM] andi15701
i will check the comparision


[8/24/2022 10:31 PM] tux_linux
cool


[8/24/2022 10:31 PM] tux_linux
basically it just can't light up still


[8/24/2022 10:39 PM] andi15701
I think I will have more time for ebookreader stuff again, after vacation I was just happy to get things forwards with proper waveform extraction early at boot in pmOS.


[8/24/2022 10:39 PM] andi15701
do you mean the backlight or some led?


[8/24/2022 10:40 PM] andi15701
btw: how many LEDs/buttons does the Kobo Glo HD have?


[8/24/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
one led and one button


[8/24/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
the main led


[8/24/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
(the only led)


[8/24/2022 11:22 PM] andi15701
I guess, then I just have to disable stuff in the Tolino Shine2 HD kernel/uboot
