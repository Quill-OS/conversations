@tux-linux maybe we can keep the discussion about CI here


[2/16/2021 1:13 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/16/2021 1:13 AM] ferminolaiz
For the record the idea is to have a gitea/gitlab instance on the new server and set up a CI worker that builds the images and publishes them for us


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] ferminolaiz
So we don't have to upload the full images and just push the updates to git


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] tux_linux
ok it's just me and myself, but
the thing is *I love hosting a Git server on a 20-year old thin client*


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] ferminolaiz
weeeell


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] ferminolaiz
hahahahaha


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] tux_linux
*it makes it useful*


[2/16/2021 1:14 AM] ferminolaiz
that is true


[2/16/2021 1:15 AM] tux_linux
but yeah I understand what you mean


[2/16/2021 1:15 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll try some stuff around and we can see if it works


[2/16/2021 1:15 AM] ferminolaiz
And if it works well and you like it, well then


[2/16/2021 1:15 AM] tux_linux
but if we have to switch, then we'll switch


[2/16/2021 1:15 AM] ferminolaiz
I'm the same way with a lot of stuff so don't even worry hahaha


[2/16/2021 1:16 AM] tux_linux
it'd be even better if we got a real Kobo port forwarded


[2/16/2021 1:16 AM] tux_linux
that really would give it a purpose


[2/16/2021 1:17 AM] tux_linux
we could say "Proudly hosted on a Kobo Glo HD"
people would be like *huh*


[2/16/2021 1:27 AM] ferminolaiz
hahahaha


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] ferminolaiz
Hm... I'm sort of thinking...


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] ferminolaiz
This would be insane


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] ferminolaiz
BUT


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] ferminolaiz
And yes, it is totally insane


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] ferminolaiz
But a cool thing to do would be


[2/16/2021 1:28 AM] tux_linux
only thing would be to hook up a real hard drive to it since SD cards wear out quickly


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] ferminolaiz
With the GitHub student pack you can get a full year of accomodation for a 1U server


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] tux_linux
what's that?


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] ferminolaiz
A rackable server


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] ferminolaiz
So you send the server and they put it in their datacenters


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] ferminolaiz
So if we get a 1U server case we could put inside some kobos and a couple more things


[2/16/2021 1:29 AM] tux_linux
hahahhaha


[2/16/2021 1:30 AM] ferminolaiz
It would be probably insane and they would complain, for sure


[2/16/2021 1:30 AM] tux_linux
that would truly be insane


[2/16/2021 1:30 AM] ferminolaiz
But it would be legendary


[2/16/2021 1:30 AM] tux_linux
of course


[2/16/2021 1:30 AM] tux_linux
they'd open the box
*what?*
*wait.... did they really sent us an... eReader?*
a couple of emails later
*oh it's running Linux!*


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
hahahahaha


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
If it's nice enough they might accept it


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
But we would need a raspi for networking


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] tux_linux
well USBnetwork somehow


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
Then a wifi dongle to broadcast the signal to the kobos


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
Or usb, yeap


[2/16/2021 1:31 AM] ferminolaiz
And some way to access it in case everything goes wrong hahahaha


[2/16/2021 1:32 AM] tux_linux
yep
which is very likely to happen


[2/16/2021 1:32 AM] tux_linux
I've seen some Kobos randomly rebooting when using Xorg, just they had no reason at all, they just decided to reboot because... well idk


[4/23/2021 6:48 PM] the.mightydill
well... you succeeded ;p


[4/24/2021 2:44 AM] pgaskin
That sounds easy enough


[4/24/2021 2:45 AM] pgaskin
I'm assuming you aren't currently building the images by hand, or that you're at least starting fresh each time


[4/24/2021 2:51 AM] tux_linux
Yes, I'm currently building inkbox/kobox images by hand, and I (of course) start fresh every time, otherwise I would feel that it's not 'clean' or something like that...
The thing is that a lot of things get added over time and if I have some helper scripts to automatically create an update package for each device when I want to (it compresses, mksquashfs, openssl sign, etc.), some changes in the rootfs like X11 integration that will be out in v1.5 are incredibly difficult to put together for the upgrade to be actually seamless and to work.
I don't know if I'm quoting an existing citation, but I feel sometimes that the most difficult part in implementing new features in an OS like that is not developing them, but actually making the update package that the user will use.


[4/24/2021 2:51 AM] pgaskin
Do you do it completely from scratch?


[4/24/2021 2:52 AM] tux_linux
The updates or the images?


[4/24/2021 2:52 AM] pgaskin
The builds


[4/24/2021 2:52 AM] pgaskin
As in, no buildroot or anything


[4/24/2021 2:59 AM] tux_linux
Boot process is as follows:
- Kernel
- Initrd (with busybox static binary for recovery purposes) which waits for a power button event, and if there is, "boots" to the second partition (recovery) by chrooting and mounting appropriate filesystems. (mmcblk0p2)
- Rootfs: Alpine 3.10 rootfs, fully bootable natively, but now I just chroot into it like the diags partition. (mmcblk0p3)
- Multiple chroots for various services: one for Xorg (Alpine 3.10), one for VNC/X11 touch input (Debian 8), and one for InkBox itself which runs a 2015 buildroot build since the glibc version supports the kernel correctly (2.6.35.3)
- Updates in the isa format are actually squashfs-compressed folders (usually in XZ, where possible) and are mounted via squashFUSE on boot. An extensions system for X11 allows seamless add/delete operations for extensions, e.g., netsurf.isa is an extension (which is like a mini root with the program and its deps), and the initrd detects it on boot and merges it (unionfs-fuse) with the main X.org rootfs, also a Squashfs, but overlayfs-fuse mounted so it can be writeable.

I hope I did not lose you...


[4/24/2021 3:00 AM] pgaskin
Have you considered using namespaces rather than chroots?


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] pgaskin
Squashfs is nice


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] pgaskin
You don't need FUSE for it, though


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
Haven't ever heard of it lol...


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
Yes, because 2.6.35.3 kernel doesn't support XZ compressed ones


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
So FUSE became handy


[4/24/2021 3:01 AM] pgaskin
Extensions remind me of systemd extensions


[4/24/2021 3:02 AM] tux_linux
to grasp a better undestanding of the mount process, maybe...

[4/24/2021 3:02 AM] pgaskin
But based on what you said, your layout is more like Nix or Gobo


[4/24/2021 3:03 AM] pgaskin
Oh, you use overlayfs


[4/24/2021 3:03 AM] tux_linux
yes, it's a giant mess of squashfuse, unionfs and overlayfs


[4/24/2021 3:03 AM] tux_linux
but the initrd does its job and it works better than I expected
like, just drag'n'drop the extension and the contents of it gets merged automatically at next boot


[4/24/2021 3:04 AM] pgaskin
Yep


[4/24/2021 3:04 AM] pgaskin
Note that you're pretty much on the path to reimplementing containers or reimplementing nixos


[4/24/2021 3:04 AM] tux_linux
the drawing was actually for me to undestand how to do it ;p


[4/24/2021 3:05 AM] pgaskin
A container runtime would probably be too heavy, though, so you'd probably want to continue doing it manually


[4/24/2021 3:05 AM] pgaskin
You might want to consider using nixos as a base, though


[4/24/2021 3:06 AM] tux_linux

[4/24/2021 3:06 AM] tux_linux
I'll look into it


[4/24/2021 3:07 AM] pgaskin
Not too bad, but beware of the overhead from all the FUSE layers


[4/24/2021 3:07 AM] pgaskin
And if not, at least use some ideas from it


[4/24/2021 3:07 AM] tux_linux
What does that do?


[4/24/2021 3:08 AM] pgaskin
FUSE requires a lot of userspace copying and context switching


[4/24/2021 3:09 AM] pgaskin
Oh, and if you want to do everything manually


[4/24/2021 3:09 AM] tux_linux
Well, idle, CPU is at ~1.3% of usage


[4/24/2021 3:09 AM] pgaskin
The first thing I suggest you work on is a packaging tool which has an input similar to Alpine or Arch


[4/24/2021 3:09 AM] pgaskin
I'm mostly talking about overhead for many small writes/reads, or for large writes through multiple layers


[4/24/2021 3:10 AM] tux_linux
Ah ok


[4/24/2021 3:10 AM] tux_linux
Packaging tool; you mean something to "package" the rootfs? or the extensions?


[4/24/2021 3:11 AM] tux_linux
`apk` sure is very handy when I need some quick native compilation


[4/24/2021 3:11 AM] pgaskin
The extensions


[4/24/2021 3:11 AM] tux_linux
Ah


[4/24/2021 3:11 AM] pgaskin
The rootfs will come naturally from that


[4/24/2021 3:11 AM] tux_linux
Well, currently, I `apk fetch` the packages (they're tar archives), then untar all of them in a directory, then mksquashfs and there you go


[4/24/2021 3:16 AM] tux_linux
Also, not that I'm in a desperate need of testers, but I saw you had a Mini, feel free to test InkBox on it if you have time (and if you want, of course)! 

You can also enable USBNet for SSH root access (after factory reset--allow root, then Diags -> Flags -> Enable USBNet), and the Kobo's IP will be 192.168.2.2


[2/6/2022 10:44 AM] anovella
Hi, maybe this is not the best place to ask this, but I think you would know that better than anyone else. Currently I have a clara HD with original soft, battery is discharging unconsistently when it's not in use. I rode somewhere that cases that turn on the screen can be a source of problems. The question is, you know any way of log this screen on events? If I see that multiple screen on occurs while I'm sleeping that will be the problem for sure.


[2/6/2022 10:46 AM] anovella
Aditional info, it can be one day to other at 80%, I read till 78%, well, the next day randomly it can be at 78% or 50%. Wifi is off all the time.


[2/6/2022 3:54 PM] tux_linux
What do you mean by "screen on events"?


[2/6/2022 3:57 PM] anovella
I would like to log when the screen is turned on, or the magnetic switch for the case


[2/6/2022 4:15 PM] tux_linux
when the device wakes from sleep?


[2/6/2022 4:18 PM] anovella
Yes


[2/6/2022 4:19 PM] tux_linux
Maybe is it already logged by Nickel


[2/6/2022 4:19 PM] tux_linux
Let me check


[2/6/2022 4:19 PM] anovella
Sorry if I don't explain well on english


[2/6/2022 4:19 PM] anovella
Thank you very much


[2/6/2022 4:20 PM] anovella
But I don't use nickle apps :( is that a problem?


[2/6/2022 4:20 PM] tux_linux
you're using koreader?


[2/6/2022 4:26 PM] anovella
No, just default reader


[2/6/2022 4:26 PM] tux_linux
that is nickel


[2/6/2022 4:27 PM] anovella
The os that comes with kobo after buy it is nickel?


[2/6/2022 4:27 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/6/2022 4:27 PM] tux_linux
Well, Nickel is the binary that contains the main UI


[2/6/2022 4:27 PM] anovella
Thats great


[2/6/2022 4:27 PM] tux_linux
There's also `pickel`, `sickel`, `hindenburg`, etc.


[2/6/2022 4:28 PM] tux_linux
plus some standard Linux utilities


[2/6/2022 4:28 PM] anovella
So I can check times the screen wakes from sleep using ssh?


[2/6/2022 4:29 PM] tux_linux
That's what I'm trying to see right now


[2/6/2022 4:29 PM] anovella
Thanks


[2/6/2022 4:30 PM] tux_linux
Actually, you can't directly


[2/6/2022 4:31 PM] tux_linux
But if you look in `dmesg` for messages like this:
```PM: resume of devices complete after 361.239 msecs
PM: Finishing wakeup.```
That tells you the device has finished waking from sleep


[2/6/2022 4:32 PM] tux_linux
Or, if you connect to Wi-Fi, you can check when `dhcpcd` restarts itself. But that is less precise, since Nickel can disable Wi-Fi too


[2/6/2022 4:32 PM] anovella
Wow I think the dmesg is what I was looking for


[2/6/2022 4:32 PM] tux_linux
But dmesg gets overwritten at some point


[2/6/2022 4:33 PM] tux_linux
by other useless things


[2/6/2022 4:33 PM] anovella
Doing grep on that could check some wakeups


[2/6/2022 6:44 PM] ninuje
Running `klogd` first will send it to the syslog, which you can read with `logread`


[2/6/2022 6:45 PM] ninuje
That'll net you timestamps, which are generally helpful


[2/6/2022 6:45 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/6/2022 6:45 PM] tux_linux
that's awesome


[2/6/2022 6:45 PM] ninuje
Keep in mind that the PM stuff may actually be logged only on *resume*


[2/6/2022 6:45 PM] tux_linux
I think it's what he wants to know


[2/6/2022 6:46 PM] ninuje
So, caveat emptor for this particular bit of messaging

[2/3/2024 4:08 AM] tux_linux
ok, good, didnt relay this one


[3/14/2024 8:32 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
Hey there folks, I have noticed that the webhosting of this project is a little bit wonky, with a DDNS.net account pointing to someone's home-lab server. I have the resources at my fingertips to be able to setup a properly hosted LAMP server for the project, if that would help out in the community efforts to grow the project.

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/14/2024 8:41 PM] szybet
That would be very cool


[3/14/2024 8:41 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
I would be happy to do that


[3/14/2024 8:41 PM] szybet
home-lab server isn't really the biggest issue here, the domain name is


[3/14/2024 8:42 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
How does InkBox.app sound? I had noticed that you are perhaps trying to do a name/rebranding though


[3/14/2024 8:42 PM] szybet
sounds good but yea, we are looking into that


[3/14/2024 8:42 PM] szybet
in a week we should know the final name I think


[3/14/2024 8:43 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
well, maybe after you all decide on a possible name change, then I can secure a domain - and host it


[3/14/2024 8:43 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
this is a great project by the way


[3/14/2024 8:44 PM] szybet
Do you have the resources for it?
We didn't cared for the domain name because at first glance, a year of domain name holding is the amount of money to buy another device to port inkbox to it


[3/14/2024 8:44 PM] szybet
thanks


[3/14/2024 8:45 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
I have a series of websites that are somewhat latent, with a multisite hosting, and I would be more than happy to do that for you... so yeah - I pretty much DO have the resources for it


[3/14/2024 8:46 PM] szybet
very cool, thanks


[3/14/2024 8:46 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
while I have your attention (on a decidedly different topic from hosting though): I am trying to access the full mico SD card on my InkBox install - and having the hell of a time with it...  I am running a Windows install, but also have access to a Linux box


[3/14/2024 8:47 PM] szybet
I started designing a new website with Publii lately


[3/14/2024 8:48 PM] szybet
Hmm access in which way? SD card over USB? or just to upload books?


[3/14/2024 8:48 PM] szybet
or over network in any way?


[3/14/2024 8:48 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
from my PC connected via USB - it is a rather large SD card, but it only shows as 510 MB


[3/14/2024 8:49 PM] szybet
what device do you have?


[3/14/2024 8:49 PM] szybet
also lets go to #quill


[3/14/2024 8:50 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
NIA


[3/25/2024 4:01 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
I've gone ahead and registered & also pointed the DNS settings to my server for the domain of https://quill-os.org


[3/25/2024 4:01 PM] tux_linux
great
my school blocks the domain

It's currently got an instance of GitHub pages running on it


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
Weird


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] szybet
give it time


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] tux_linux
no, my school firewall blocks like everything


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] tux_linux
even inkbox.ddns.net


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] szybet
fucking idiots haha


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] szybet
get a vpn to your home


[3/25/2024 4:02 PM] tux_linux
strangely i can still access discord here


[3/25/2024 4:03 PM] leo_chrom
Me too


[3/25/2024 4:03 PM] tux_linux
given 1mb/s uplink speed probably wouldnt be that great


[3/25/2024 4:04 PM] szybet
500 Kb/S is fine for code server


[3/25/2024 4:39 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr

I ( or smn ) will create a website with Publii, then we will upload it


[3/25/2024 5:25 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
brilliant


[3/25/2024 5:25 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
that is much easier


[3/25/2024 5:25 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr
... for me at least


[4/2/2024 9:02 PM] m8torr
Why not host the site on Oracle Cloud? It has an Always Free Tier account, you get 4 ARM vCPUs, 24GB of memory and 200GB storage


[4/2/2024 9:02 PM] szybet
Xsf will host it for us


[4/2/2024 9:02 PM] szybet
This will probably require to attach a credit card


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] szybet
The problem always was domain name not hosting


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
are you kidding


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] m8torr
It does, but the benefit of the Free Tier, is that it doesn’t let it charge anything


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
then i sign up


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] szybet
I mean if you want you can have a third mirror


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
24gb of ram


[4/2/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
thats insane


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] tux_linux
my home server has 24gb of ram


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] szybet
I doubt in these specs


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] m8torr
You can split it in 4 VMs


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] tux_linux
can you just have 1 vm


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] m8torr
I host my personal minecraft servers in there


[4/2/2024 9:04 PM] m8torr
Yes, you can have 1VM with everything allocated to it

Third mirror then


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] tux_linux
good


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] tux_linux
im signing up


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] szybet
Idk why we need it tho


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] szybet
2 were fine


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] tux_linux
maybe a gitlab server


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] tux_linux
we can move it there


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] tux_linux
will be faster


[4/2/2024 9:05 PM] szybet
I still prefer github


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
gitlab has a fucked up ui


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
you hate microsoft


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
or gitea at this point


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
oh


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
At least they do reasonable ui


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
cgit


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
lmao


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
Bruh


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
Get gitlab and i will do ci cd at one point in it


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
ok


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] szybet
Thats a good idea


[4/2/2024 9:06 PM] tux_linux
i will put it and give you ssh access when its done


[4/2/2024 9:07 PM] szybet
If you setup gitlab right i wont need to


[4/2/2024 9:07 PM] szybet
Well thanks man for the tip


[4/2/2024 9:08 PM] tux_linux
yea


[4/2/2024 10:20 PM] zoli111
do you want to move the repos to gitlab or the downloads or just the site?


[4/2/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
no, i have this server at inkbox.ddns.net/git


[4/2/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
its slow


[4/2/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
could be better on a vps


[4/2/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
but oracle doesnt like my credit card for some reason


[4/2/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
i filed a support request


[4/2/2024 10:22 PM] zoli111
I see


[4/2/2024 10:23 PM] zoli111
it's like a mirror?


[4/2/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/2/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
incomplete


[4/2/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
but most important repos are in it


[4/2/2024 10:40 PM] szybet
Its for "i wont contribute to closed source repo provider" person if it ever shows up, then we can sync them up properly


[4/2/2024 10:40 PM] szybet
For the same reason matrix exists


[4/2/2024 10:41 PM] szybet
"i wont contribute unless there is a proper open source way to communicate" kind of person


[4/2/2024 11:49 PM] m8torr
it does for every credit card, thay are forcing to contact support to prevent automated sign ups

{Reactions}
😂 

[4/2/2024 11:49 PM] tux_linux
Great design


[4/2/2024 11:49 PM] m8torr
one thing to note, is once you choose a region, you cannot change that
