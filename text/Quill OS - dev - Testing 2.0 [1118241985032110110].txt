Wdym


[6/13/2023 8:15 PM] tux_linux
Sometimes it is epubtool's fault


[6/13/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Does it say "no books found on your device"?

[6/13/2023 8:16 PM] szybet
i mounted it one more time


[6/13/2023 8:16 PM] szybet
oh no


[6/13/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux
what did you do


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
upload them


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] tux_linux
start usb mass storage while ssh was in /data/onboard?


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
no


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
wifi off


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
i unmounted them in dolphin


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
maybe it wasn't enough


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] tux_linux
ok..


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] tux_linux
`eject /dev/sdx`?


[6/13/2023 8:17 PM] tux_linux
`sync`?


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] szybet
well how do i repair this now


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] tux_linux
i/o error?


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] szybet
its read only


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] szybet
i dont see those books in shell via serial


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] tux_linux
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdx


[6/13/2023 8:18 PM] tux_linux
shouldn't be too harmful


[6/13/2023 8:19 PM] szybet
oh ok


[6/13/2023 8:19 PM] szybet
makes sense


[6/13/2023 8:21 PM] szybet
well sleeping while its connected is bad


[6/13/2023 8:21 PM] szybet
another thing


[6/13/2023 8:21 PM] tux_linux
??


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] szybet
idle sleep


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] tux_linux
isn't it supposed to disconnect automatically?


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] szybet
IPD sleeping


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] szybet
while its connected via usb


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] tux_linux
oh


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] tux_linux
ouch


[6/13/2023 8:22 PM] szybet
i can fix that


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] tux_linux
which way


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
any easy way for me to detect if its connected?


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
?????????????? disable sleeping while its connected?


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] tux_linux
well yes, but how do you know when it's in usbms and it's connected


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
i'm asking you that


[6/13/2023 8:23 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
well


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] szybet
i will maybe just create a file


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
just look up the loaded modules list


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
no


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] szybet
arent they loaded all the time?


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
if you find g_mass_storage it's in usbms


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
no


[6/13/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
can't coexist with usbnet


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
after i formated it & recconected, the old gutenberg book appeared


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
interesting


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] tux_linux
it happens


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
how


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] tux_linux
it just happens, idk??


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
cool


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] tux_linux
i'm not even surprised


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
ghost books


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] tux_linux
yes


[6/13/2023 8:26 PM] szybet
its a feature, not a bug


[6/13/2023 8:27 PM] tux_linux
yes


[6/13/2023 8:27 PM] szybet
i'm not able to upload books via usb at all


[6/13/2023 8:28 PM] tux_linux
what's the problem


[6/13/2023 8:28 PM] szybet
books don't appear in onboard


[6/13/2023 8:28 PM] szybet
at all


[6/13/2023 8:28 PM] szybet
i unmounted, tryied sync a few times, nothing


[6/13/2023 8:28 PM] tux_linux
did you have an ssh session in /data/onboard


[6/13/2023 8:30 PM] szybet
same io error as before


[6/13/2023 8:30 PM] szybet
no


[6/13/2023 8:30 PM] tux_linux
delete onboard in /data/storage and recreate it


[6/13/2023 8:30 PM] tux_linux
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/storage/onboard bs=1M count=128
mkfs.vfat /data/storage/onboard
```


[6/13/2023 8:30 PM] tux_linux
this will create a 128m onboard storage space


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] szybet
i will try it via PC, otherwise we need an option in settings to restore this


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] tux_linux
it already exists


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] tux_linux
settings->reset


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] tux_linux
calls soft-reset.sh script from recoveryfs


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] szybet
it does that?


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] szybet
okay


[6/13/2023 8:31 PM] tux_linux
it should

cursed scroll bar


[6/13/2023 8:35 PM] tux_linux
on touch n905b it initially said "Width: - Width: 450 +"


[6/13/2023 8:35 PM] szybet
doesnt make sense


[6/13/2023 8:36 PM] tux_linux
yea


[6/13/2023 8:36 PM] szybet
anyway, widgetwrap is something you look for

qt option


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] tux_linux
it works


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] tux_linux
it's just saying it can't mount fs as ext2 or ext3 because it has ext4 features


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] szybet
screen is blank and nothing more happens?


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] tux_linux
oh


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] szybet
XD


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] tux_linux
you have to wait a bit more?


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] tux_linux
usually 45s?


[6/13/2023 8:38 PM] szybet

yes?


[6/13/2023 8:40 PM] szybet
what otherwise


[6/13/2023 8:40 PM] tux_linux
ok will try on mine


[6/13/2023 8:40 PM] szybet
dont rush with 2.0, as you see


[6/13/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
we need to test almost a year of work


[6/13/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
and dont be frustrated and pesymistic


[6/13/2023 8:41 PM] tux_linux
ok starting


[6/13/2023 8:43 PM] tux_linux
is your power led still flashing


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
yep


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
it still theoretically writes 512m to flash


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
so might take some time?


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
ok then


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
i'm taking a pause


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
will be back in 30 minutes


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/13/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
np


[6/13/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
maybe you will be faster giving me permissions to gui bundle than me changing remote url :D


[6/13/2023 8:45 PM] tux_linux
you should have submitted a patch


[6/13/2023 8:45 PM] tux_linux
it would already have been applied


[6/13/2023 8:45 PM] tux_linux
also i think you already have permissions


[6/13/2023 8:46 PM] szybet
noo to lazy


[6/13/2023 8:46 PM] tux_linux
change remote url to gitlab one


[6/13/2023 8:46 PM] szybet
github.


[6/13/2023 8:46 PM] tux_linux
no because github doesn't mirror itself


[6/13/2023 8:46 PM] tux_linux
i need to do it manually otherwise


[6/13/2023 8:50 PM] tux_linux
it's doing nothing


[6/13/2023 8:51 PM] tux_linux
will try to fix it


[6/13/2023 8:51 PM] tux_linux
meanwhile try to see if you can actually boot in diags in your device by clicking the power button multiple times at boot once the kernel has started


[6/13/2023 9:21 PM] szybet
OKay


[6/13/2023 9:22 PM] szybet
the diode is still blinking after 30 minutes, nothing happened

[6/13/2023 9:26 PM] szybet

why


[6/13/2023 9:54 PM] szybet
i will write one myself


[6/13/2023 9:55 PM] tux_linux
yes but not now


[6/13/2023 9:55 PM] tux_linux
then it's probably mutool's fault
something it doesn't like in the book

the book is 400 Kb


[6/13/2023 10:04 PM] szybet
i did the same on pc - mutool is broken on inkbox


[6/13/2023 10:17 PM] szybet
epub - txt - pdf work as normal


[6/13/2023 10:36 PM] tux_linux
`watch -n 0.1 ls -shal /inkbox/book/split`


[6/13/2023 10:36 PM] szybet
on pc the command worked on inkbox it did not


[6/13/2023 10:36 PM] szybet
it overflows


[6/13/2023 10:36 PM] szybet
we need to update mutool for 2.1, thats it


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] tux_linux
we can update it now


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] tux_linux
no guarantee it will solve the problem


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] tux_linux
it will probably create new ones


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] szybet
leave it


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] szybet
we fix things but not such big ones


[6/13/2023 10:37 PM] tux_linux
ok

[6/13/2023 10:42 PM] tux_linux
well what was the fix


[6/13/2023 10:42 PM] szybet
*i will*


[6/13/2023 10:43 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/13/2023 10:45 PM] tux_linux
if you do `echo true > /boot/flags/DIAGS_BOOT` and reboot, does it boot in diags?


[6/13/2023 10:46 PM] szybet
trying it


[6/13/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
#bot


[6/13/2023 10:48 PM] szybet
diags booted


[6/13/2023 10:48 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/13/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
diags is available only in rooted kernel?


[6/13/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
also what diffrence is hard soft reset


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] tux_linux
no


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
and its diffrent than on the nia c


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
there is an option to root the device


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] tux_linux
hard restores entire system
original f/w version


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] tux_linux
for devices that shipped with 1.5 it restores 1.5 even if they were on 1.9


[6/13/2023 10:50 PM] tux_linux
?


[6/13/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
allow root access


[6/13/2023 10:52 PM] tux_linux
there is an option to root the device
*if you reset it*


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] tux_linux
it wipes everything, restores original fw and roots the device


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
um okay


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
from where does it get a rooted kernel


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] tux_linux
from `/opt/recovery/restore`


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] tux_linux
factory kernels are stored there


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] tux_linux
matching original fw


[6/13/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
okay so... cool


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
how many times did i needed to explain people how to root


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
and there is an option for that

well i'm not sure writing 3.6G to the SD twice is a good idea either


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
nah :D


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
but what


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
how


[6/13/2023 10:54 PM] tux_linux
?


[6/13/2023 10:55 PM] szybet
recompiling kernel


[6/13/2023 10:55 PM] szybet
not this


[6/13/2023 10:55 PM] tux_linux
yes, the recovery process makes the device write the whole original f/w to rootfs, user and boot partitions


[6/13/2023 10:55 PM] tux_linux
from tar.xz or squashfs archives stored in recoveryfs


[6/13/2023 10:55 PM] tux_linux
recoveryfs stays intact


[6/13/2023 10:56 PM] tux_linux
they can grab the root kernel from update packages if they are on a fixed release


[6/13/2023 10:56 PM] szybet
oh okay


[6/13/2023 10:56 PM] szybet
cool

[6/13/2023 11:01 PM] szybet
we blocked access to these devices


[6/13/2023 11:01 PM] tux_linux
for which reason


[6/13/2023 11:02 PM] szybet
event0 - ipd manages
even1 - we use evdev handler which worked good and no reason to change it


[6/13/2023 11:02 PM] szybet
evdev != udev


[6/13/2023 11:02 PM] tux_linux

[6/14/2023 1:14 PM] szybet
can you change the limit for n306 to be 3 characters less?


[6/14/2023 1:16 PM] szybet
some pdf / epubs have some weird formating for special characters - dont care, works 90% of the time


[6/14/2023 2:08 PM] tux_linux
Well I could
But this is bound to happen
Sometimes you will get another book to fill it up even with this number of characters


[6/14/2023 2:09 PM] szybet
well the solution is to change it to text browser, it has better "wrapping" capabilities


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] tux_linux
There is an option to wrap text for qlabel
Maybe try it?


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] tux_linux
There's probably a reason why it wasn't enabled


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] szybet
actually


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] szybet
qlabel is fine


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] tux_linux
Probably makes buttons too big


[6/14/2023 2:10 PM] szybet
i remembered wrong, sanki uses qlbalels


[6/14/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
actually no


[6/14/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
XD


[6/14/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
```cpp
ui->textBrowser->setText(stats);
    QApplication::processEvents();
    // To make it fit...
    qDebug() << "ui->textBrowser->height()" << ui->textBrowser->height();
    qDebug() << "ui->textBrowser->document()->size().height()" << ui->textBrowser->document()->size().height();
    if(ui->textBrowser->height() < ui->textBrowser->document()->size().height()) {
        ui->textBrowser->setFixedHeight(ui->textBrowser->document()->size().height() + 20);
    }
```


[6/14/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
sanki uses this everywhere


[6/14/2023 2:13 PM] szybet
and its a qtextedit with no interactions enabled


[6/14/2023 2:13 PM] tux_linux
Idk
I think one more line would make buttons overflow the screen


[6/14/2023 2:13 PM] tux_linux
Vertically


[6/14/2023 2:13 PM] szybet
not really, there is a lot of space


[6/14/2023 2:13 PM] szybet
also, scroll bars


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] tux_linux
On mini?


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
well thats the solution, i will add it for the next todo


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
on nia ;p


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] tux_linux
Scrollbars don't make sense


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] tux_linux
Not there


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
they make.


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] tux_linux
We already have a page list


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
shown only if needed


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
if the name is too long


[6/14/2023 2:14 PM] tux_linux
They will always show, you know qt


[6/14/2023 2:15 PM] szybet
whatever, we can propably detect if the qapp size increased


[6/14/2023 2:15 PM] szybet
i will add it to todo, lets think about it later

[6/14/2023 2:16 PM] tux_linux
I think I fixed the restore issue


[6/14/2023 2:16 PM] tux_linux
It wasn't rebooting because of new init


[6/14/2023 2:17 PM] tux_linux
Needed to add -f


[6/14/2023 2:17 PM] szybet
you can create another nia image


[6/14/2023 2:18 PM] tux_linux
You can just unsquash recoveryfs and add reboot -f in soft-reset.sh, then pack it again


[6/14/2023 2:18 PM] szybet
nah, create a new one and i will continue testing


[6/14/2023 2:18 PM] szybet

and?


[6/14/2023 11:52 PM] szybet
what do i do


[6/14/2023 11:52 PM] tux_linux

[6/14/2023 11:52 PM] tux_linux
it can just be left like that


[6/14/2023 11:52 PM] tux_linux
the os sets defaults if there aren't


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] szybet
fbdepth repaired itself after launching inkbox


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] szybet
no reboot - nothing


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] szybet
any idea?


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] tux_linux
it depends on each device


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] tux_linux
it's because it went to sleep


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] tux_linux
will try on glo hd


[6/14/2023 11:53 PM] szybet
but why only with oobe


[6/14/2023 11:54 PM] tux_linux
go figure


[6/14/2023 11:54 PM] tux_linux
what if you restart it and you put it to sleep yourself instead?


[6/14/2023 11:55 PM] szybet
ok it happens every time with this new image


[6/14/2023 11:55 PM] szybet

even on inkbox?

yep


[6/14/2023 11:55 PM] tux_linux
wdym


[6/14/2023 11:56 PM] szybet
why did it happen basically


[6/14/2023 11:56 PM] szybet
if i fix it now, will you be able to create an image?


[6/14/2023 11:56 PM] tux_linux
just update your rootfs


[6/14/2023 11:56 PM] tux_linux
it will be enough


[6/14/2023 11:57 PM] tux_linux
of course i could but it wouldn't be worth it


[6/14/2023 11:59 PM] szybet
I want to test the final imageeee okay then


[6/14/2023 11:59 PM] szybet
Maybe you update radio buttons in oob?

then... wait


[6/15/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
auto cameras use sd cards


[6/15/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
they dont die that much often


[6/15/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
so stop worrying about inkbox


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] tux_linux
did you enable xorg


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
where


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
what


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] tux_linux
before


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
i didn't disabled it in oob, i wasn't able to


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] tux_linux
it is the problem


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] tux_linux
hang on


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
because


[6/15/2023 12:15 AM] tux_linux
xorg is xorg


[6/15/2023 12:15 AM] tux_linux
likes to mess up with fb


[6/15/2023 12:15 AM] tux_linux
just like when it freezes it


[6/15/2023 12:15 AM] szybet
when inkbox first boots it is on


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
yes


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
if i disable it, it is disabled only on reboot


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
yes


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
so what's your point


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
well


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
🥴


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
ok nvm


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
still does it without xorg


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] tux_linux
great


[6/15/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
while i wait for root you can try to debug it


[6/15/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
try some logs


[6/15/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
or simply recompile ipd..


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
```
void restoreFbDepth() {
  // fbdepth.c is a pretty complicated file so
  if (model == "n437" or model == "kt") {
    if (fileExists("/kobo/tmp/inkbox_running") == true) {
      system("/opt/bin/fbink/fbdepth -d 8");
    } else {
      // X11 is running, elsewise there is something wrong ...
      if (model == "kt") {
        system("/opt/bin/fbink/fbdepth -d 32");
      } else {
        system("/opt/bin/fbink/fbdepth -d 16");
      }
    }
  }
```


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] tux_linux
oh no


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] tux_linux
it works with normal binary


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] tux_linux
when was the last time you pulled the repo


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
you can change it to use the built in program launcher with blocking option, it will have logs


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
?


[6/15/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
what


[6/15/2023 12:20 AM] szybet
what, i pushed my changes and nothing else?


[6/15/2023 12:20 AM] tux_linux
did you just change this?

im dumb yes


[6/15/2023 12:21 AM] tux_linux
i will try this code


[6/15/2023 12:21 AM] tux_linux
because it worked before we switched to ipd


[6/15/2023 12:21 AM] tux_linux
in the shell scripts


[6/15/2023 12:22 AM] tux_linux
i am doubtful about fbink_set_fb_info


[6/15/2023 12:22 AM] szybet
but this freeaking worked


[6/15/2023 12:22 AM] szybet
i tested it


[6/15/2023 12:22 AM] szybet
actually what are you doing here


[6/15/2023 12:22 AM] tux_linux
when did it break


[6/15/2023 12:23 AM] szybet
if inkbox then 8?


[6/15/2023 12:23 AM] tux_linux
it's complicated


[6/15/2023 12:23 AM] szybet
explain


[6/15/2023 12:23 AM] tux_linux
i can't

so?

then it doesn't make sense

cmake --build vs make, what the difference?
After
cd build
cmake -B . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -S ..

Looks like
cmake --build .

and
make

do the same here on macOS.
So, when should I use one or the ot...

wait then


[6/15/2023 1:09 AM] tux_linux
so what do we do


[6/15/2023 1:09 AM] szybet
sec


[6/15/2023 1:09 AM] tux_linux
ok


[6/15/2023 1:10 AM] szybet
look up freezeApps


[6/15/2023 1:11 AM] szybet
replicate the code so if there is any pid, in appsPids it does the thingy


[6/15/2023 1:11 AM] szybet
put the code in apps freeze


[6/15/2023 1:11 AM] szybet
and use the function in fbink thing and replace the code that is duplicated now in freezeApps function


[6/15/2023 1:12 AM] szybet
dont break things, i'm going to sleep, its 1:12 here

👍 

[6/15/2023 1:12 AM] tux_linux
ok thanks


[6/15/2023 1:12 AM] szybet
so you create 2 functions, one generic that returns the vector and the other that uses it just as freeze apps

Grab all inkbox repos and grep -R to look for that filr


[6/15/2023 1:17 AM] tux_linux
actually I think I will just check if x11 is running and do the opposite


[6/15/2023 1:17 AM] tux_linux

just qt


[6/15/2023 2:46 PM] tux_linux
it's not good


[6/15/2023 2:46 PM] tux_linux
shouldn't be there anymore


[6/15/2023 2:46 PM] tux_linux
to remove for 2.1


[6/15/2023 2:46 PM] tux_linux
now it works so we don't touch it


[6/15/2023 2:46 PM] szybet
there is QT_SCALE something that works great, i use it for rss

There may be a fbdepth tweak relevant for nia if you experience issues when walking from sleep when you are in x11


[6/15/2023 2:58 PM] szybet
in x11, not only turned on?


[6/15/2023 2:58 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[6/15/2023 2:58 PM] tux_linux
Try to launch an x11 app
Then quit, go back to Gui,
Launch it again
Go back to Gui
Sleep
Wake
Launch it again


[6/15/2023 2:58 PM] tux_linux
If you pass all of these tests you don't need the fixes


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] tux_linux
You probably will need them


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] szybet
will it actually work?


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] tux_linux
Maybe


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] tux_linux
Otherwise


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] tux_linux
We don't care


[6/15/2023 2:59 PM] tux_linux
It has basic functionality


[6/15/2023 3:01 PM] tux_linux
Also try to sleep/wake when running x11 app


[6/15/2023 3:02 PM] szybet

[6/15/2023 3:14 PM] szybet
you forgot that re-launching xorg apps dont work on the nia


[6/15/2023 3:14 PM] szybet
apart from that


[6/15/2023 3:15 PM] szybet
sleeping with kterm launched works, but the app is not put to sleep - ipd doesnt tryies to? 
you can add xorg app names to /data/config/20-sleep_daemon/appsList


[6/15/2023 3:25 PM] szybet
apart from that, everything is fine


[6/15/2023 3:27 PM] tux_linux
Wdym


[6/15/2023 3:27 PM] szybet
we talked about this


[6/15/2023 3:27 PM] tux_linux
Yeah it's not great


[6/15/2023 3:28 PM] szybet
i launch an app xorg one eveyrtthing good - exit and launc again - the screen is buggy as hell


[6/15/2023 3:28 PM] tux_linux
You can check running x program in /tmp/X_program probably


[6/15/2023 3:28 PM] szybet
what


[6/15/2023 3:28 PM] tux_linux
It shows command line of the program


[6/15/2023 3:28 PM] tux_linux
Is it there on your device?


[6/15/2023 3:29 PM] tux_linux
If you launch some app


[6/15/2023 3:29 PM] tux_linux
Otherwise it may be deleted by the script
I think you could remove the delete calls if there are


[6/15/2023 3:29 PM] szybet
okay


[6/15/2023 3:29 PM] szybet
how could this help


[6/15/2023 3:29 PM] szybet
its eink fault


[6/15/2023 3:30 PM] tux_linux
No I'm talking about freezing app


[6/15/2023 3:30 PM] szybet
oh


[6/15/2023 8:40 PM] szybet
add a warning on models where xorg is half working that its experimental


[6/15/2023 8:40 PM] szybet
+ dont enable it at first boot


[6/15/2023 8:40 PM] tux_linux
Because of the freeze issue?


[6/15/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
it launches only once on the nia


[6/15/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
idk about others


[6/15/2023 8:42 PM] tux_linux
What does it do when you launch it the second time


[6/15/2023 8:43 PM] szybet
also blank is running for some reasdon i posted it before


[6/15/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux
Isn't that normal?


[6/15/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
it should now run only in ipd?


[6/15/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
god damn


[6/15/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux

[6/15/2023 8:44 PM] tux_linux

[6/15/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
no, we need to be able to both edit it


[6/15/2023 8:45 PM] tux_linux
I can edit it too


[6/15/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
also github is slow


[6/15/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
google sheets


[6/15/2023 8:45 PM] tux_linux
