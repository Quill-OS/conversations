[3/28/2024 11:31 AM] szybet

[3/28/2024 11:31 AM] szybet

[3/28/2024 11:47 AM] tux_linux
3rd maybe


[3/28/2024 11:48 AM] szybet
yea


[3/28/2024 2:37 PM] zoli111
I combined #3 and #4 and made it more feather-like

[3/28/2024 2:37 PM] tux_linux
nice, but maybe a more simplistic feather, and the Q handle slightly curved like in a serif font


[3/28/2024 2:38 PM] szybet
I like this feather


[3/28/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
i dont


[3/28/2024 2:38 PM] szybet
`simplistic` in what way


[3/28/2024 2:38 PM] szybet
maybe precise that


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] tux_linux
remove the small bits


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] szybet
oof


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] szybet
i like them


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] tux_linux
just leave the main line


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] szybet
but whatever


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] zoli111
this is w/o the "cuts"

[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/28/2024 2:39 PM] szybet
maybe grey out the feather?

[3/28/2024 2:40 PM] tux_linux
q a bit like this


[3/28/2024 2:40 PM] tux_linux
yea feather grayed out looks nice


[3/28/2024 2:41 PM] tux_linux
also i think you can be more generous with the weight of the O behind

[3/28/2024 2:45 PM] tux_linux
looks nice


[3/28/2024 2:46 PM] tux_linux
now it seems either the handle is too thin or the O is too bold


[3/28/2024 2:46 PM] zoli111
If I make the handle wider the feather will look off


[3/28/2024 2:47 PM] zoli111

[3/28/2024 2:47 PM] tux_linux
this looks great


[3/28/2024 2:48 PM] tux_linux
but O isnt aligned with the bottom of the handle


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] tux_linux
sorry for being picky


[3/28/2024 3:05 PM] zoli111
no problem


[3/28/2024 3:05 PM] zoli111
It's understandable if you want a great logo


[3/28/2024 3:06 PM] zoli111
and feedback is important


[3/28/2024 3:07 PM] zoli111
here is the aligned version

[3/28/2024 3:35 PM] zoli111
tux-linux is right


[3/28/2024 3:35 PM] zoli111
the thicker looks a bit better


[3/28/2024 3:35 PM] tux_linux
maybe in-between


[3/28/2024 3:35 PM] tux_linux
o only a little bit thicker

Do you have inkscape file?


[3/28/2024 8:59 PM] tux_linux
Thanks


[3/28/2024 9:05 PM] zoli111
I think it would to create a separate github repo for branding


[3/28/2024 9:43 PM] szybet
sure


[3/28/2024 9:43 PM] szybet
how do you want to name it


[3/28/2024 10:08 PM] zoli111
quillos-branding maybe?


[3/28/2024 10:08 PM] zoli111
I'm not sure if it's the right word


[3/28/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
so branding then


[3/28/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
what was your github profile again?


[3/28/2024 10:09 PM] zoli111
zoli111


[3/28/2024 10:09 PM] tux_linux
Just name it branding


[3/28/2024 10:09 PM] tux_linux
It's already in quill org


[3/28/2024 10:09 PM] zoli111
makes sense


[3/28/2024 10:09 PM] zoli111
I'll clean it up and create a PR


[3/28/2024 10:10 PM] tux_linux

what is the difference from editable and non editable?


[3/28/2024 11:00 PM] zoli111
in the non editable version shapes are merged together, and the whole document is cleaned up


[3/28/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
oh okay


[3/29/2024 9:37 AM] zoli111
Are you fine putting the artwork under CC BY-SA license?


[3/29/2024 1:47 PM] zoli111

[3/30/2024 2:03 PM] tux_linux
blakc on gray


[3/30/2024 2:03 PM] tux_linux

[3/30/2024 2:06 PM] tux_linux
hang on a bit


[3/30/2024 2:06 PM] szybet

[3/30/2024 2:06 PM] szybet

[3/30/2024 2:09 PM] szybet
Awesome


[3/30/2024 2:09 PM] szybet
You should post it to the repo too


[3/30/2024 2:09 PM] zoli111
will


[3/30/2024 2:09 PM] zoli111
there is one more problem


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] zoli111
discord has a light mode too


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] zoli111
so a background is needed


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] szybet
what can i say


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] szybet
people should not use it


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] zoli111
and it will be used on github and elsewhere too


[3/30/2024 2:10 PM] szybet
I think just leave it


[3/30/2024 2:11 PM] szybet
and also invert it back, it may be used somewhere else too in that form


[3/30/2024 2:11 PM] zoli111
with black bg
