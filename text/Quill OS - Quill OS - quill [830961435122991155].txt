[3/14/2022 8:23 PM] tux_linux
I don't really know
Will be something to improve for 2.0 if possible


[3/15/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
can I tare apart idle_sleep to the service file + idle_sleep.sh? i tryied to add some features and it drives me crazy, nothing works in this file


[3/15/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
propably becouse of the weird shell thats in there


[3/15/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
No, keep it in the service


[3/15/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
It should be using bash


[3/15/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
More recent service I've made aren't using separate scripts


[3/15/2022 11:29 PM] szybet
It should, but nothing works😫


[3/15/2022 11:32 PM] tux_linux
what's your script?


[3/16/2022 7:20 AM] szybet
I will sens it later


[3/16/2022 4:47 PM] szybet
something like this

[3/16/2022 4:48 PM] szybet
it doesn't even create /tmp/ssh_session


[3/16/2022 4:48 PM] szybet
idk...


[3/16/2022 4:50 PM] szybet
actually it does


[3/16/2022 4:50 PM] szybet
yestarday it didn't


[3/16/2022 5:01 PM] szybet
how to check if the poweroff sequence started?


[3/16/2022 5:33 PM] tux_linux
poweroff sequence?
You mean when it shuts down?


[3/16/2022 5:33 PM] szybet
yes


[3/16/2022 5:33 PM] szybet
i want to fix a bug


[3/16/2022 5:34 PM] tux_linux
I haven't created a way to know this, but you can see /sbin/poweroff and /sbin/prepare_shutdown


[3/16/2022 5:34 PM] szybet
okay


[3/16/2022 5:34 PM] szybet
maybe /tmp/power_off_started with true in it?


[3/16/2022 5:40 PM] szybet
why does /etc/ssh/sshd_config not save beetwen boots?


[3/16/2022 5:47 PM] szybet
weird that service restart doesn't work, i need to reboot to apply changes


[3/16/2022 6:09 PM] szybet
its not there in git

The kernel build in inkbox is complicated


[3/16/2022 9:45 PM] tux_linux

[3/16/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
But I can add your SSH config for SFTP, shouldn't be a problem


[3/16/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
What was it again?


[3/16/2022 9:46 PM] szybet
I will test it more and then give a pull request

[3/16/2022 10:23 PM] tux_linux
Why did you move sleep_standby and wake_standby stop commands into poweroff and reboot files?


[3/16/2022 10:24 PM] szybet
i clicked reboot but idle_sleep triggered when the brightness was going down, so it went sleep. it will now shut those services faster and prevent that

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/16/2022 10:24 PM] szybet
a rare bug, but still possible


[3/16/2022 10:25 PM] szybet

👀


[3/19/2022 5:26 AM] tux_linux
Did you not plan to do that?


[3/19/2022 11:04 AM] szybet
Thats about sshfs


[3/19/2022 11:05 AM] szybet
Im talking Here about sleeping fixes


[3/19/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
ok, I'll test them before


[3/19/2022 5:30 PM] szybet
i tested them and it works, but sure


[3/19/2022 5:31 PM] tux_linux
Did you test with Wi-Fi reconnection, interrupt while reconnecting and all that mess?


[3/19/2022 5:33 PM] szybet
not really, but i have been using it and didn't saw a problem doing various things


[3/19/2022 5:37 PM] tux_linux
It waits 15s before actually going to sleep
So it would have had the time to power off


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] szybet
well, still the sleeping screen appears and then it goes poweroff


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
Every time?


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] szybet
i said its rare


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] szybet
but still


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[3/19/2022 5:38 PM] szybet
maybe move the poweroff fbink command near the end


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
or execute it 2 times


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
there are many fixes for this


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] tux_linux
rm /dev/fb0


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] tux_linux
That works too


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
oh, for example


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
do it as you want


[3/19/2022 5:39 PM] tux_linux
Might be better
I'll see

its usb storage


[3/20/2022 8:38 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/20/2022 8:39 PM] tux_linux
It's individual settings for each book


[3/20/2022 8:39 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2022 10:08 PM] tux_linux
Reboot


[3/20/2022 10:13 PM] szybet
i looked up, some books dissapered, after canceling the file chooser this again happened

and a folder A-Page-Number appered


[3/20/2022 10:15 PM] szybet
1 Reboot

i cant really use the e-reader now👀


[3/20/2022 10:19 PM] szybet

[3/20/2022 10:25 PM] tux_linux
Not my fault


[3/20/2022 10:25 PM] tux_linux
I know
I tried to solve this problem but I didn't find a solution


[3/20/2022 10:25 PM] tux_linux
It goes away when you enable global reading settings


[3/20/2022 10:25 PM] szybet
It would be funny if the SD card inside turned read only


[3/20/2022 10:26 PM] szybet
there is something really bad in your code happening


[3/20/2022 10:27 PM] tux_linux
I know what it is
I put the necessary fix
But it doesn't work


[3/20/2022 10:28 PM] szybet
do some checks if your fix actually worked?


[3/20/2022 10:30 PM] szybet
the usb storage i will need to debug later. scp worked


[3/20/2022 10:31 PM] szybet
why the QT file chooser doesn't like characters like ł ż ś ć... propably font issue?


[3/20/2022 10:31 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2022 11:20 PM] szybet
Clicking the file chooser and switching pdfs turned off the brightness, and restored it after cancel button


[3/20/2022 11:21 PM] szybet
Do you have a bug list? I think there are too many small problems to use github for it


[3/20/2022 11:25 PM] szybet
It appears not so often, but still


[3/21/2022 1:35 PM] tux_linux
Use GitHub, document the issues well, with detailed information, and I'll close them when they get solved.
I could host a "bugzilla", but then I'd have to disable GitHub issues, which I don't really want to.


[3/21/2022 1:40 PM] szybet
Okay


[3/22/2022 10:39 PM] szybet
@tux-linux Can i get permissions to assign labbels on github?, you wouldn't need to do that


[3/22/2022 10:57 PM] szybet
and im just archiving those issues for later


[3/22/2022 10:58 PM] tux_linux
Uhm, I need to provide you write access to the whole repository


[3/22/2022 10:59 PM] szybet
well, your decision


[3/22/2022 11:00 PM] szybet
i dont think https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/issues/19 and https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/issues/21 are duplicates


[3/22/2022 11:00 PM] tux_linux
they are triggered by the same issue
so, yes


[3/22/2022 11:00 PM] szybet
okay


[3/22/2022 11:01 PM] tux_linux
#24, what are you talking about?


[3/22/2022 11:02 PM] szybet
1 zoom in x times
2 switch page
3 the page isin't zoomed, but the slider is on position x


[3/22/2022 11:05 PM] szybet
Is that on purpuse?
1 switch system wide night mode to on
2 go to book
3 its white, i need to click the moon button


[3/22/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/22/2022 11:06 PM] tux_linux
because maybe you read some book only at night and don't want the rest of your theme settings to be affected


[3/22/2022 11:06 PM] szybet
true, but on the other hand it will burn someones eyes at 1 am😆


[3/22/2022 11:07 PM] tux_linux
depends on which way you see it


[3/22/2022 11:26 PM] tux_linux

[3/22/2022 11:35 PM] tux_linux
eink
i don't have control over that


[3/22/2022 11:44 PM] szybet
In Qt, yes


[3/22/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux

Here its ok, but too much space to the corner


[3/23/2022 2:43 PM] tux_linux
The weird characters are taking up more space than they should
I set a threshold for that but it seems weird characters bypass it
Solution: open some new books with shorter file names


[3/23/2022 2:43 PM] tux_linux
This should never happen


[3/23/2022 2:49 PM] szybet
Bruh...


[3/23/2022 2:49 PM] szybet
Never is now


[3/23/2022 3:55 PM] tux_linux
Anyways, it doesn't restrict usability


[3/23/2022 3:57 PM] tux_linux
But is it really a problem


[3/23/2022 3:58 PM] tux_linux
Maybe you didn't get the update when I fixed that


[3/23/2022 4:23 PM] szybet
Maybe


[3/24/2022 4:43 AM] tux_linux
I fixed a lot of issues


[3/24/2022 8:39 AM] szybet
You can create a GUI bundle and i will check them


[3/24/2022 8:40 AM] szybet
It would be nice if you assign a"to check" label to the fixed issues on github


[3/24/2022 8:40 AM] szybet
Rootfs needs to be updated to?


[3/24/2022 8:40 AM] szybet
And what is the difference between GUI bundles, why are they device specific


[3/24/2022 11:16 AM] tux_linux
I check them


[3/24/2022 11:16 AM] tux_linux
Digital signatures


[3/24/2022 11:17 AM] tux_linux
I'll make it sometime in the morning if I have time


[3/24/2022 11:17 AM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/24/2022 12:29 PM] szybet
There is something wrong with inkbox GUI service


[3/24/2022 12:30 PM] szybet
I checked, ps doesn't showed inkbox process, maybe it crashed but the service did't restarted itself


[3/24/2022 12:30 PM] szybet
After restarting inkbox gui everything works fine


[3/24/2022 12:31 PM] szybet
The service didn't crashed when the process did, it was still 'started'


[3/24/2022 12:42 PM] szybet
+ why there is python 3.9.2


[3/24/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
Other for every device? Why?


[3/24/2022 1:44 PM] tux_linux
text file parsing


[3/24/2022 1:44 PM] tux_linux
yeah sure, it's normal


[3/24/2022 1:44 PM] tux_linux
every other service that has something to do stops it before if needed


[3/24/2022 1:45 PM] szybet
Just no...


[3/24/2022 1:46 PM] tux_linux
i know
that was the first thing I implemented
march 2021
i was dumb in qt


[3/24/2022 1:46 PM] tux_linux
If you want to develop a better parsing engine, you're welcome


[3/24/2022 1:47 PM] szybet
No? The service could restart itself to avoid freezing the entire device and rebooting


[3/24/2022 1:47 PM] szybet
I want many things to develop, for now I don't have much time


[3/24/2022 1:47 PM] tux_linux
Well, yes, but this leads to problems
e.g. if you start xorg, you stop inkbox_gui and it **must** not be started


[3/24/2022 1:48 PM] szybet
This needs to be resolved in some way


[3/24/2022 1:48 PM] szybet
Another service that checks xorg and inkbox?


[3/24/2022 1:48 PM] tux_linux
I will develop something like sickel for 2.0


[3/24/2022 1:49 PM] tux_linux
or maybe just add a while loop in `/usr/bin/inkbox.sh` that restarts inkbox-bin if the exit code is not 0


[3/24/2022 1:51 PM] szybet
That's a option too


[3/24/2022 1:51 PM] tux_linux
that would actually be really easy


[3/24/2022 1:54 PM] tux_linux
Can you test your rootfs PR one more time in all possible usecases and tell me if it's working properly? Then, I will merge it

Now i see that cpu governor is not managed. i can add this, you should focus on qt side but i need to know which cpufreq governor to set. default is ondemand, for sleeping it should be powersave, i will add this. But in my experience interactive mode is better than ondemand. @tux-linux  you decide and i will add it


[3/24/2022 8:38 PM] szybet
even koreader manages that:
https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/ea3fa5c2c7ed7330e8e1e6ef838b780e7998ea51/platform/sony-prstux/suspend.sh


[3/24/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
I guess that's a good idea


[3/24/2022 9:38 PM] szybet
So interactive mode?


[3/24/2022 9:40 PM] tux_linux
Well, first we need to know if if works well; IIRC, there were some issues on other devices about cpugovernor, would need @NiLuJe  insight on this


[3/24/2022 9:40 PM] tux_linux
That's probably the reason why going to sleep would take more battery than Nickel


[3/24/2022 9:49 PM] szybet
i changed to powersave and the device was slower


[3/25/2022 5:29 PM] tux_linux
done

Hi everyone, I'm searching information about flashing inkbox into Kobo Libra H2O

[3/25/2022 9:05 PM] szybet
I think its not done yet, the porting to it


[3/25/2022 9:05 PM] szybet
look at #porting at Kobo libra H20 tread


[3/27/2022 1:09 AM] ninuje
Use interactive on  devices that have it. i'ts tuned like ass, but it's better than the rest, and you can't tune it any better anyway since there's no matching support in the input driver (and it's also old)


[3/27/2022 1:10 AM] ninuje
On older devices (those w/ dvfs),  a tuned conservative can work somewhat decently, c.f., KOReader's startup script


[3/27/2022 1:10 AM] ninuje
my TL;DR would be: don't bother, and keep the defaults. (I'm assuming boot defaults are nickel defaults, though. This may not actually hold).


[3/27/2022 1:10 AM] ninuje
it's not going do any miracles, but it *will* ruin UI latency very easily


[3/27/2022 1:10 AM] ninuje

Where is the part in the source code when he prints on the screen "Inkbox ebook reader"?


[3/28/2022 10:29 PM] tux_linux
It's a compiled file at `/etc/init.d/splash.d/init_show`.
I lost the source code, but it was one of my first programs for Kobos and InkBox was originally going to be written in C with only FBInk as the library. I realized that it was almost impossible to do, so I decided to go the Qt way. The files in this directory are the remnants of what InkBox would have been with FBInk.
You can try `/etc/init.d/splash.d/init` to get a glimpse of how it would have looked.

so i cant look at it and repair the cutted e in half


[3/28/2022 10:33 PM] szybet
well, i will write it in the future


[3/28/2022 10:36 PM] tux_linux
Uh?


[3/28/2022 10:36 PM] tux_linux

[3/29/2022 6:33 AM] szybet

[3/29/2022 6:33 AM] tux_linux
are you using minicom?


[3/29/2022 6:34 AM] szybet
Yes, but there was > at the end


[3/29/2022 6:34 AM] tux_linux
yeah, minicom cuts end of lines and does not print the rest of them


[3/29/2022 6:34 AM] tux_linux

Setting up the timezone with GUI ... It is possible but using the slider is not easy at start, it's not intuitive to use. Also setting the time after applying timezone... Maybe without a reboot?


[3/29/2022 10:05 AM] szybet
After changing pages it always shows "you have reached the end"


[3/29/2022 10:06 AM] szybet
After this the page goes blank, the text disappears


[3/29/2022 10:06 AM] szybet
Completely not usable


[3/29/2022 10:08 AM] szybet
This was with global settings enabled,


[3/29/2022 10:12 AM] szybet
After I disabled it... Some of my books dissapered, in the file chooser appeared config directories, enabling global settings back freezed the device


[3/29/2022 10:16 AM] szybet
What the hell... What is global reading settings, it's so buggy and problematic


[3/29/2022 11:33 AM] szybet

Maybe updating the GUI bundle caused this all?


[3/29/2022 11:40 AM] szybet
Maybe create a bug channel o discord, i dont know if its Worth it reporting those issues on github


[3/29/2022 11:56 AM] szybet

[3/29/2022 12:36 PM] tux_linux
It should work right away

No recoveryfs yet


[3/29/2022 12:37 PM] tux_linux
You can drag your finger on the list, up and down, and it will scroll


[3/29/2022 12:40 PM] tux_linux
Well, normally it's something you enable/disable once and you leave there afterwards, so that was not part of my testing.
Also, please don't be so harsh


[3/29/2022 12:43 PM] tux_linux
If the update finished successfully, no


[3/29/2022 12:45 PM] tux_linux
Clean your onboard storage
`mkfs.vfat /data/storage/onboard`


[3/29/2022 12:46 PM] tux_linux
At this point, with you mangling between Nickel and InkBox on the same SD card, it might just be corruption due to flash wear


[3/29/2022 1:02 PM] szybet
I needed a minute to figure it out, not intuitive


[3/29/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
Okay, sorry but its still this was sad

👍 

[3/29/2022 1:06 PM] szybet
Also, there is no qr code and no sshfs support


[3/29/2022 1:06 PM] szybet
But I compiled a new kernel


[3/29/2022 1:06 PM] szybet
Weirddd


[3/29/2022 1:11 PM] szybet
Maybe with a rooted kernel, if a error code accours telnet over usb could be turned on?


[3/29/2022 1:11 PM] szybet
This should't be hard to implement


[3/29/2022 2:16 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/29/2022 3:07 PM] tux_linux
When you open a book and flip through pages, does it refresh every time? And when you open the options menu, it refreshes when it has to refresh (e.g. each 3 pages)?


[3/29/2022 3:07 PM] tux_linux
I have this problem on my Kobos and can't find out why at all
Even the debug output I wrote makes sense when it is run


[3/29/2022 3:50 PM] szybet
You mean the whole screen?


[3/29/2022 3:54 PM] szybet
That it turns white-black-white?

Ok


[3/29/2022 7:38 PM] tux_linux
Done


[3/29/2022 7:38 PM] szybet

You should really think of buying another SD card


[3/29/2022 7:39 PM] szybet
no, the problem is now that i need to open the case


[3/29/2022 7:39 PM] tux_linux
Not to worry, I think it affects all of them anyway, so no problem


[3/29/2022 7:41 PM] szybet
i have to open it, i would really prefer not doing it many times. before I repair it i want to do the telnet thing when it crashes before

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/29/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux
Sure, but actually, when it shows an error with a QR code, it shuts down after.
So, maybe not so easy to implement


[3/29/2022 8:53 PM] tux_linux
Maybe I could get it to start usbnet on reboot if it failed before


[3/29/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
start telnet
wait 3 minutes
check if telnet connection is on
if not, shutdown

*its that easy*


[3/29/2022 9:13 PM] tux_linux
I have a better idea


[3/29/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
The thing first shuts down with the error code and writes to a flag
Then it reboots, reads the flag and starts telnet without anything else
On the next reboot the flag is unset and the device boot as normal, writes to the flag again if it can't boot and displays an error code


[3/29/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
your decision


[3/29/2022 11:49 PM] tux_linux
I found that the culprit was the setEnabled calls in the next/previous buttons to prevent too fast page turning as you proposed. I assume Qt devs never have eInk in mind, but it triggers a repaint event, which results in the screen flashing. How awesome.
@NiLuJe , @sherm_p , @pgaskin , if you have some time, is there a way to prevent an entire screen refresh when I setEnabled() true or false a QPushButton?
Otherwise, I think I'll disable those because a screen refresh at each page turn is not a sane way to read a book...


[3/30/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
You shut down the device via CLI
Not the reboot button in InkBox
right?


[3/30/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
When you click reboot in InkBox, the program terminates itself, and that prevents this issue

Will start a telnet+ftp server on USBNet on `192.168.2.2` by default if it reboots from an error splash. The IP can be changed as usual with the `USBNET_IP` flag.


[3/30/2022 4:07 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet BTW, I added a `DFL` flag, which will export the entire MMC over USB on boot without the need of pressing a key combination.

Qt is painfull


[3/30/2022 2:40 PM] tux_linux
No, it's in the kernel/initrd
It uses `g_mass_storage`

Basically UMS mode but from Linux

DO_FACTORY_RESET or something

is it normal that there are no  QR codes?

what if i write both flags?


[3/30/2022 7:24 PM] szybet
will telnet launch or ums?

why are here so many files?...


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] tux_linux
It's the rootfs?...


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] tux_linux
Yes, congrats


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] szybet
in /etc?
so many config files?


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] szybet
how


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] tux_linux
Installed by default


[3/30/2022 8:56 PM] tux_linux
I don't know, but my commit disappeared


[3/30/2022 8:57 PM] szybet
i pushed some changes to my repo


[3/30/2022 8:57 PM] szybet
and it deleted your commit?


[3/30/2022 8:57 PM] szybet
okay, i didn't see them before


[3/30/2022 9:07 PM] szybet
Why does the sshfs thing dont update


[3/30/2022 9:07 PM] szybet
updating the kernel doesn't affect it


[3/30/2022 9:14 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/30/2022 9:14 PM] tux_linux
Contents of config file?


[3/30/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
why is it like that? i cant update my repo without affecting a old pull request?


[3/30/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
Rcs-root


[3/30/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
so the sshd_config file, yes


[3/30/2022 9:19 PM] szybet
my repo is broken


[3/30/2022 9:19 PM] szybet
simply broken


[3/30/2022 9:19 PM] szybet
and your commit doesn't work


[3/30/2022 9:20 PM] szybet
`~ # cat /tmp/sshd_config 
PermitRootLogin yes\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\n# If sshfs doesn't work, first enable read-write support, then begin a connection with sshfs`


[3/30/2022 9:21 PM] szybet
maybe leave it as i wanted? its cleaner code, and one echo and 3 won't give a much diffrence in speed


[3/30/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
No it should work


[3/30/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
it doesn't


[3/30/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
What's the contents of rcs root on your device?


[3/30/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
the part you are interested in is: `echo "PermitRootLogin yes\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\n# If sshfs doesn't work, first enable read-write support, then begin a connection with sshfs" >> /tmp/sshd_config`


[3/30/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
Oh
I forgot -e after echo


[3/30/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
yes


[3/30/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
Is it bind-mounted correctly though?


[3/30/2022 11:17 PM] szybet
yes


[3/30/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
ok, I'll change it


[3/30/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
if i can find out how with your repo


[3/30/2022 11:18 PM] szybet
idk what happened there


[3/30/2022 11:18 PM] szybet
this forked repo is a mess


[3/30/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
maybe i can make the changes on my own and credit you in the commit


[3/30/2022 11:19 PM] szybet

if its the same as in my commits the yes


[3/30/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
maybe you could remove the \n in `internal-sftp\n# If sshfs`


[3/30/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
but its only what you prefer


[3/30/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
i prefer to keep it like that


[3/30/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
will commit now

[3/30/2022 11:56 PM] tux_linux

Aren't there enough?


[3/31/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
Pre release won't be in the release

[3/31/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
Oh
I searched for that, there doesn't seem to be an obvious fix, besides, it seems to happen randomly, sometimes the characters show up properly


[3/31/2022 11:18 PM] szybet
no, they never


[3/31/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
They seem to be in the font

[3/31/2022 11:43 PM] szybet
yes


[3/31/2022 11:44 PM] szybet
the question is:
1 does the system show them correctly at low level
2 does qt filechooser use these fonts


[3/31/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
1 idk
2 yes


[3/31/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
maybe its using system fonts, and they don't have those characters


[3/31/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux
no, it's definitely using the U001 font


[3/31/2022 11:52 PM] szybet
maybe just install some alpine system fonts?


[3/31/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
what difference would it do


[3/31/2022 11:53 PM] szybet
idk, this needs more debugging info

[4/1/2022 8:51 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[4/1/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
why


[4/1/2022 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Because
Kernel bug


[4/1/2022 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Try it without and you'll see


[4/1/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
well okay


[4/1/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
maybe adding sync before this is needed? plato had similar issues too

No it is not related

`ERROR: font-noto-extra-0_git20170920-r0: No space left on device`


[4/2/2022 6:26 PM] szybet
how do i make it bigger :/


[4/2/2022 6:27 PM] tux_linux
you used the entire 66M available on the partition?


[4/2/2022 6:27 PM] tux_linux
well, there is no way


[4/2/2022 6:28 PM] szybet
i have installed powertop... i2c tools... idk what more


[4/2/2022 6:28 PM] tux_linux
font-noto-extra is a very big package iirc


[4/2/2022 6:30 PM] szybet
common


[4/2/2022 6:30 PM] tux_linux
well, there is no way


[4/2/2022 6:30 PM] tux_linux
unless you throw them directly in the compressed archive
but that is probably not an ideal solution


[4/2/2022 6:31 PM] szybet
is it the size of the p3 limiting it?


[4/2/2022 6:31 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/2/2022 6:31 PM] szybet
and the reasons why i cant expand it are?


[4/2/2022 6:31 PM] tux_linux
why do you want to install this package anyway?


[4/2/2022 6:32 PM] szybet
i want fonts in file chooser to work


[4/2/2022 6:32 PM] szybet
or just test it


[4/2/2022 6:32 PM] tux_linux
it won't change if you put them in the rootfs


[4/2/2022 6:32 PM] tux_linux
Qt fonts dir is `/kobo/mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/lib/fonts`


[4/2/2022 6:33 PM] tux_linux
60% of existing supported devices have this partition layout and an update to it would require an entire SD reflash


[4/2/2022 6:34 PM] szybet
for me, for testing purpuses


[4/2/2022 6:34 PM] tux_linux
well, you don't need it now because it isn't the place where you should put the fonts


[4/2/2022 6:34 PM] szybet
now


[4/2/2022 6:37 PM] tux_linux
```

[4/2/2022 6:38 PM] tux_linux
maybe you should also remove existing fonts in `lib/fonts` to give you more luck


[4/2/2022 6:39 PM] tux_linux
you can expand it, but it wouldn't do real good to your SD card


[4/2/2022 6:40 PM] szybet

[4/2/2022 6:59 PM] szybet
this makes no sense


[4/2/2022 6:59 PM] tux_linux
what exactly?


[4/2/2022 8:28 PM] tux_linux
... you there?


[4/2/2022 8:28 PM] szybet
um yes


[4/2/2022 8:28 PM] szybet
the font thing, i gived up


[4/2/2022 8:29 PM] tux_linux
ok


[4/2/2022 8:29 PM] szybet
propably writing a replacemant for file chooser would be easier than debugging this


[4/2/2022 8:29 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[4/2/2022 8:36 PM] tux_linux
I updated the gui bundle if you want to have the latest bugfixes/features


[4/2/2022 8:37 PM] tux_linux

[4/2/2022 8:40 PM] tux_linux
Would there be other things to do before 1.9 release?


[4/2/2022 8:41 PM] szybet
scroll bars


[4/2/2022 8:41 PM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[4/2/2022 8:41 PM] szybet

QScrollBar stylesheet resize handle
I need to style some scrollbars as in the image:
After much pain and experimentation, I found how to make the gradient, and hide the arrows.

m_scrollBarStyleSheet = "QScrollBar:horizontal { \n "
...

[4/2/2022 8:45 PM] tux_linux
we were thinking that it was qsliders


[4/2/2022 8:45 PM] tux_linux
but actually they are qscrollbars


[4/2/2022 8:45 PM] szybet
😐


[4/2/2022 8:46 PM] szybet
yuo are using sliders everywhere right?


[4/2/2022 8:46 PM] tux_linux
wait
there are settings in the stylesheet for the handle of a qscrollbar
though i don't know if they actually work


[4/2/2022 8:46 PM] tux_linux
qscrollbars


[4/2/2022 8:46 PM] tux_linux
except for brightness slider in mainwindow/brightnessdialog

it will not look like that, right?

also for:

will changing the margin solve the issue?

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-95DF2.png


[4/2/2022 8:50 PM] tux_linux
probably too big


[4/2/2022 8:51 PM] tux_linux
Yes but that would make the home button impossible to click


[4/2/2022 8:51 PM] szybet
maybe add this to settings? a bit overkill but everyone has diffrent sized fingers


[4/2/2022 8:51 PM] szybet
which one


[4/2/2022 8:51 PM] tux_linux
the one close to the info button


[4/2/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
change the margin only for the pdf, not the menu


[4/2/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
do this dynamically


[4/2/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
the exit button could be bigger anyway


[4/2/2022 8:53 PM] tux_linux
the thing is that the pdf is in the main grid layout and the menu too


[4/2/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
you can't change the margins after showing the layout?


[4/2/2022 8:54 PM] tux_linux
the layout encloses menu + graphicsView which contains the PDF page image


[4/2/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
i knwo, but change the margins dynamically?


[4/2/2022 8:55 PM] tux_linux
it wouldn't work


[4/2/2022 8:55 PM] szybet
maybe... change the margins lower but add additional margins for the menu


[4/2/2022 8:55 PM] szybet
with a frame for example?


[4/2/2022 8:56 PM] tux_linux
i'm not sure I follow you


[4/2/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
add more margins to this but remove them from "reader"

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-43D37.png


[4/2/2022 8:58 PM] tux_linux
every time i change something in the reader class layout a mess happens


[4/2/2022 8:59 PM] tux_linux
but maybe I can set a slightly lower margin to give pdfs more space while not stretching the ui too much


[4/2/2022 9:00 PM] szybet
why would this do anything


[4/2/2022 9:00 PM] szybet
no no no the home button its already too hard to click


[4/2/2022 9:01 PM] tux_linux
actually it wasn't a good idea

if you understand what im saying, could you try this?


[4/2/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
i hope it will not do something


[4/2/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
and it will work


[4/2/2022 9:03 PM] tux_linux
also that's what the margin would look like on the nia
a bit too much right?


[4/2/2022 9:03 PM] szybet
idk, you need to find a solution for all devices


[4/2/2022 9:04 PM] tux_linux
can you do it and send me the .ui file?

is the pdf still cutted out?


[4/2/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
or less


[4/2/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
less


[4/2/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
but the ui is unusable


[4/2/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
than wait


[4/2/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
i will do it more


[4/2/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
i only changed half of it

this is a bit too much i think


[4/2/2022 9:18 PM] szybet
but its for testing


[4/2/2022 9:20 PM] szybet
becouse its too near the border?


[4/2/2022 9:20 PM] szybet
and what about the pdf?


[4/2/2022 9:20 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/2/2022 9:21 PM] tux_linux
seems to be worse


[4/2/2022 9:21 PM] szybet
? how


[4/2/2022 9:21 PM] tux_linux
compare with other screenshots


[4/2/2022 9:22 PM] tux_linux
wait i took the wrong screenshot


[4/2/2022 9:22 PM] szybet

better


[4/2/2022 9:23 PM] tux_linux
well, not the ui


[4/2/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
and the pdf?


[4/2/2022 9:23 PM] tux_linux
better


[4/2/2022 9:23 PM] tux_linux
but the scrollbars are unusable
even if I scale them up it will be ugly


[4/2/2022 9:23 PM] szybet
why is this even affecting scroll bars?


[4/2/2022 9:24 PM] tux_linux
because they are part of QTextEdit and QGraphicsView


[4/2/2022 9:24 PM] szybet
did the scroll bars get smaller?


[4/2/2022 9:25 PM] tux_linux
unrelated
I'm playing around with the stylesheet


[4/2/2022 9:26 PM] szybet
if you want to try more this idea you can go to page_20 and gridLayout_7 to edit the margin even more

[4/2/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
idk, testing is needed


[4/2/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
ok, even more bugfixes
I updated the GUI bundle again


[4/2/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
Increased scrollbar size by 5px but it's all I can do for now
It seems it will be a complete mess to change all of this


[4/3/2022 2:44 PM] tux_linux
Goal of the day: get scrollbars working then freeze commits for 1.9 release and start working on factory images and update packages


[4/3/2022 2:46 PM] szybet
Ale factory images available with root kernel? ( security not enforced )


[4/3/2022 2:47 PM] tux_linux
Nope


[4/3/2022 2:47 PM] tux_linux
It is fairly easy to root one though


[4/3/2022 2:48 PM] tux_linux
The official version being that you get in the recoveryfs and you reset as root


[4/3/2022 2:51 PM] tux_linux
Yesterday I started to design a way to create reproducible image builds, but I gave up, maybe I'll have some success today


[4/3/2022 3:10 PM] szybet
You need to make a script for this, its too much work by hand


[4/3/2022 9:48 PM] szybet
does inkbox support rotating?


[4/3/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
No and it will not
Too complicated


[4/3/2022 9:48 PM] szybet
i dont think so, but maybe only 180 degrees?


[4/3/2022 9:48 PM] szybet
180* degrees?


[4/3/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
Idk


[4/3/2022 10:22 PM] szybet
does only the kobo nia use the hal sensor for sleep? only it uses the F1 number?


[4/3/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
I think all devices do use KEY_F1


[4/5/2022 7:34 AM] tux_linux
There's now a logger active when the `DEBUG=1` env var is set. Will make it easier to debug in the future...

Well, I'll need to put log calls in the app, but the base is there


[4/5/2022 2:54 PM] tux_linux
I \*think\* I'm going to freeze the current commits for 1.9 release


[4/5/2022 10:40 PM] tux_linux
Awesome, wake on touch also affects the Glo

@NiLuJe : I got as close as this and it worked (so, probably not kernel-related, as you said; the Nia is a strange exception)
Only because I was running it from a shell (and it executes the exact same commands as if it had been launched by OpenRC).
Is there a common name for this problem? Nonsense™?


[4/6/2022 9:42 PM] szybet
Hm?


[4/6/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
This was discussed in #chat


[4/6/2022 11:06 PM] szybet
And i dont understand this part here


[4/6/2022 11:11 PM] szybet
How do i save words?


[4/6/2022 11:11 PM] tux_linux
Double click the word and click on the star


[4/6/2022 11:11 PM] tux_linux
(when you're reading)


[4/6/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
Then its not working


[4/6/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
Why


[4/6/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
Wait, i xan only save words?


[4/6/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
You can also unsave them by clicking on the star again


[4/6/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
I tryied staring sentences, and nothing


[4/6/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
Now checked, words too. Nothing


[4/6/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
This needs improvements


[4/6/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
But the text selecting mechanism is not bad


[4/6/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
It's saved **words**


[4/6/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
Pretty good, maybe adding arrows like in koreader and then it's the best


[4/6/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
Then it's useless a bit


[4/6/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
But there are no words in saved words app


[4/6/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
Nickel has the same thing

Dealing with the kernel and event codes works much better in C/C++


[4/6/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
I will probably take ideas from your implementation too


[4/6/2022 11:40 PM] szybet
You need to. Your is sloww


[4/6/2022 11:40 PM] szybet
But the result is the same


[4/6/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
You really found that fun to understand?


[4/6/2022 11:41 PM] szybet
In short, "it looks bad" and?


[4/6/2022 11:41 PM] szybet
You mean?


[4/6/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
It's just not a mentally sane way to handle that kind of things


[4/6/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
It's a nightmare to debug and a real learning curve, probably harder than C/C++, for someone to actually understand it completely


[4/6/2022 11:42 PM] szybet
Well okay


[4/6/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
Yours is fast because the Nia doesn't need the 10s delay before actually going to sleep
Other devices do


[4/6/2022 11:43 PM] szybet
No. Kt goes to sleep still after 10s


[4/6/2022 11:43 PM] tux_linux
Then why do you say it's fast?


[4/6/2022 11:44 PM] szybet
It's faster because the manager don't need to wait for something to finish. ( why I would need to finish connecting to wifi when I want to go to sleep ). It kills it and starts going to sleep


[4/6/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
It's the same way around, it kills the sleep script and starts the after script


[4/6/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
Also some improvements in order


[4/6/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
Do it properly, so I don't need to redesign it


[4/6/2022 11:46 PM] tux_linux
That does not mean I will accept your changes ;p


[4/6/2022 11:47 PM] tux_linux
i'll see


[4/6/2022 11:49 PM] tux_linux
tonight I'll make the final touches and release 1.9


[4/6/2022 11:52 PM] szybet
If you do it the old way I will not be happy. The user input should be always handled, no matter what


[4/6/2022 11:53 PM] tux_linux
Well, that was already planned


[4/6/2022 11:57 PM] szybet
How will you handle building the roots then?


[4/6/2022 11:57 PM] tux_linux
?


[4/7/2022 12:00 AM] szybet
How will you build the rrotfs, you need to compile a bin file before


[4/7/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
The bin will probably be included and I'll update it when needed


[4/7/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
Like 2048 in gui-bundle


[4/7/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
or qreversi


[4/7/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
I'll provide the source code on another repo

decalibrates? that's a hardware issue

Hmm im building a module with audio through USB, maybe adding a small CPU that would send it using serial and a good rtc module would be good


[4/8/2022 1:59 PM] szybet
U-Boot would not work with a serial USB adapter right? There would be no access becouse it uses low level CPU pins?


[4/8/2022 2:07 PM] tux_linux
You can't access U-Boot once the kernel has started AFAIK
At least, that's how it is on sunxi devices


[4/8/2022 2:08 PM] tux_linux
I'll add it


[4/8/2022 2:09 PM] tux_linux

can you do it?


[4/8/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
um...


[4/8/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
Have you tried to reduce Epub page size?


[4/8/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
what?


[4/8/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
this will not fix the problem


[4/8/2022 9:55 PM] tux_linux
Yes it will


[4/8/2022 9:56 PM] szybet
why...


[4/8/2022 9:56 PM] szybet
so to what walue do i set it?


[4/8/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
Try...?


[4/8/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
Lower


[4/8/2022 9:57 PM] szybet
now it uses half the screen


[4/8/2022 9:57 PM] szybet
just no


[4/8/2022 9:57 PM] szybet
it will not work


[4/8/2022 9:58 PM] szybet
it will be never perfect using this


[4/8/2022 9:58 PM] tux_linux
Have you tried to set only height or only width?


[4/8/2022 9:58 PM] szybet
both to 300


[4/8/2022 9:58 PM] tux_linux
It is difficult to have a perfect fit because the user can choose fonts


[4/8/2022 9:59 PM] szybet
+ the font is smaller


[4/8/2022 9:59 PM] tux_linux
Which change the text, this the page, size


[4/8/2022 9:59 PM] tux_linux
That is impossible


[4/8/2022 9:59 PM] szybet
it will be if you won't cut pages to smaller pages. its just stupid for the most part


[4/8/2022 9:59 PM] szybet
just show the entire page


[4/8/2022 10:00 PM] szybet
5Kb of more text won't kill performance


[4/8/2022 10:00 PM] tux_linux
How? Will just be more scrolling to do


[4/8/2022 10:00 PM] szybet
but this scrolling will make sense


[4/8/2022 10:00 PM] tux_linux
There's no entire page


[4/8/2022 10:01 PM] tux_linux
If you want that just increase the size in Settings


[4/8/2022 10:01 PM] szybet
+ this will be the best way to mark lines of text in the future. koreader has problems with that


[4/8/2022 10:02 PM] szybet
then we need to find a way that scrolling 2 lines won't be needed


[4/8/2022 10:02 PM] szybet
for all configurations


[4/8/2022 10:04 PM] tux_linux
But then you have to split bigger pages into smaller pages
And insert missing text in the next page
Change page numbers
Keep in mind that fonts are different
This will be a nightmare


[4/8/2022 10:04 PM] tux_linux
Also the auto save page thing will be messed up


[4/8/2022 10:08 PM] szybet
> But then you have to split bigger pages into smaller pages
you are already doing this

> And insert missing text in the next page
its better then scrolling

> Change page numbers
how are pages calculated in epubs?

> Keep in mind that fonts are different
yes

> This will be a nightmare
yes.

do we have another way?

> Also the auto save page thing will be messed up
it already is


[4/8/2022 10:14 PM] szybet
i will try to make a small qt app demo


[4/8/2022 10:14 PM] szybet
with it


[4/8/2022 10:14 PM] szybet
but after sanki is released


[4/8/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
Use qtextdocument with the full book XHTML
At the time I tried it it was incredibly complicated and a nightmare to understand
But in theory it should break the ePUB into pages adapting on the screen size


[4/8/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
Honestly I am not sure it is the right way either


[4/8/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
qtextdocument? i though its qtextedit


[4/8/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
It is currently


[4/8/2022 10:38 PM] szybet
oh okay


[4/8/2022 10:38 PM] tux_linux
But I'm not even sure it would work actually


[4/8/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
tomorrow I'll work on imgtool and hopefully we'll have reproducible images soon ready for release


[4/8/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
I think everything is done/ready for 1.9


[4/8/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
As for the timezone stuff, I don't have an idea about what's going on, but at least what I set up works since NTP syncs fine


[4/8/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
Dis you try what niluje said?


[4/8/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
oh yeah; i need to do it too


[4/8/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
i forgot that


[4/8/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
it's not related to the timezone though


[4/9/2022 7:45 AM] szybet
Does it improve time accuracy to a good level?


[4/9/2022 2:34 PM] tux_linux
I'll test it today
But I haven't got devices that drift during sleep AFAIK


[4/9/2022 3:43 PM] szybet
Nia is shifting even in nickel


[4/9/2022 4:26 PM] tux_linux
whoops


[4/10/2022 2:44 AM] ninuje
Yeah, George mentioned that Nickel had been doing an hctosys on resume since basically forever because of similar issues (possibly on very very old devices, though ;p The Nia is the only "recent" device affected, AFAIK).

[4/10/2022 5:49 PM] tux_linux
@Szybet did you test the sliders?


[4/10/2022 5:49 PM] szybet
i will do it in max 4 hours today from now

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/10/2022 5:50 PM] tux_linux
I'll continue working on imgtool from my side


[4/10/2022 11:28 PM] szybet
better, but not perfect


[4/10/2022 11:28 PM] szybet
almost perfect


[4/11/2022 12:36 AM] tux_linux
ok


[4/11/2022 6:36 AM] szybet
Maybe make that the slider jumps per 2%, then it will be longer in horizontal orientation?


[4/11/2022 2:53 PM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[4/11/2022 3:47 PM] szybet
In the slider, the thing you slide ( the black one ) is to small in horizontal orientation (its maybe widthh?). Its becouse its 100 numbers and percantage grom that. Doing it in half would make the slide thing bigger. Or maybe there is a Vetter solution


[4/11/2022 3:48 PM] szybet
Adding like 5 pixels to it would solve the issue


[4/13/2022 4:35 AM] tux_linux

[4/13/2022 6:34 AM] szybet
Is this your private server?


[4/13/2022 6:36 AM] szybet
Could be worse


[4/13/2022 9:24 AM] tux_linux
It's @fermino 's one
He permits me to put InkBox packages there, which is really cool


[4/13/2022 11:17 AM] szybet

[4/13/2022 11:18 AM] szybet

why does it matter?


[4/13/2022 2:33 PM] tux_linux
No, GH file size limit is 80M
Otherwise, you have to pay for LFS


[4/13/2022 3:39 PM] szybet
IF you focus on security in inkbox that much then maybe this server too


[4/13/2022 3:39 PM] szybet
Hm okay


[4/13/2022 8:49 PM] tux_linux
It's only for download
So like, what's the point of using https


[4/13/2022 8:49 PM] tux_linux
The main website is in https


[4/13/2022 8:49 PM] szybet
the only risk is for replacing the files in there


[4/13/2022 8:49 PM] tux_linux
And how would https help?


[4/13/2022 8:50 PM] szybet
where did i say anything about https, no, maybe md5sums on github?


[4/13/2022 8:50 PM] tux_linux
sha256sums could be a good idea
Maybe on the website


[4/13/2022 8:51 PM] szybet
no... whats the point if giving sums on the same website. if someone replaces the files then whats the problem with replacing the sums


[4/13/2022 8:51 PM] tux_linux
No, I mean the main website


[4/13/2022 8:51 PM] tux_linux
On the downloads page


[4/13/2022 8:51 PM] szybet
i think linux mint had a breach like that before


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux
https://inkbox.ddns.net/downloads.html


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux
There


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
its still the same server?


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux
No


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux
It's also versioned on GitHub


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
well, good


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] szybet
but i would still prever sums on github too


[4/13/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux

is it normal that in sleep the battery is degrading like 70% in 2/3 days?


[4/13/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
i think on nickel it was similar


[4/13/2022 8:54 PM] tux_linux
Maybe cpugovernor thing


[4/13/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
oh yea, i set cpufreq to another thing 😆

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/13/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
oh to this: i have another idea for it: a deep sleep button in the menu. it would apply powersave for the cpu, unload all modules ( usb things eat up battery too ), disable some services like sshd. it would improve battery life


[4/13/2022 8:59 PM] szybet
it would stand up from sleep more ( its a thing for cpugovernor powersave ) but if i know i would't use the reader for 2 days i would use it


[4/14/2022 7:43 PM] szybet
@tux-linux  so you simply want to rewrite the current sleep scripts into cpp or something more?


[4/14/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
Basically that, yes


[4/14/2022 8:19 PM] szybet
so i want to write it


[4/14/2022 8:21 PM] tux_linux
What if I want to?


[4/14/2022 8:22 PM] szybet
then you write it, and i edit it later for my weird case


[4/14/2022 8:25 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[4/14/2022 8:26 PM] tux_linux
Maybe explain it and I'll try to include it the code already


[4/14/2022 8:27 PM] szybet
```
soo can i redesign it for the kobo nia as a setting option that it will:
- its sleeping
- value 0 detected
- value 1 ( its on the back )
- value 0 detected
- value 1 detected, the sleep cover is back on the top go to sleep now

this software mod is the only thing i can think of that would work
```

[4/17/2022 4:54 PM] szybet
@NonaSuomy which version of inkbox do you have


[4/17/2022 4:54 PM] nonasuomy
Maybe I have to update from the 1.5 to 1.8


[4/17/2022 4:55 PM] nonasuomy
1.5


[4/17/2022 4:55 PM] szybet
its really old, update it to be sure


[4/17/2022 4:55 PM] szybet
newer version have also better user experience


[4/17/2022 4:57 PM] nonasuomy
Does inkbox support cbz/cbr?


[4/17/2022 4:58 PM] szybet
i dont think so, but it could in the future, maybe you could convert them to pdfs?


[4/17/2022 5:06 PM] nonasuomy
It’s just nice having the direct support for the formats so you can download them direct from libgen.gs without a computer involved.


[4/17/2022 5:09 PM] nonasuomy
Have you tried to make any apps or other things for inkbox?


[4/17/2022 5:10 PM] szybet
yes, sure. we will add it to the list to add


[4/17/2022 5:11 PM] szybet
yes, im writing sanki for inkbox right now https://github.com/Szybet/sanki
most of the part is just writing a regular qt app, so its pretty easy. you can go with full bare metal fbink too


[4/17/2022 5:11 PM] szybet
inkbox is the best for it, writing apps for plato, koreader or nickel is harder and not so good appearing


[4/17/2022 5:12 PM] nonasuomy
Is Anki an E reader app?


[4/17/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
no, but sanki will


[4/17/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
thats the point of it


[4/17/2022 5:14 PM] nonasuomy
What is sanki? I looked at the link and don’t see a readme.md


[4/17/2022 5:14 PM] szybet
is it a manga format? maybe mangareader supports it


[4/17/2022 5:14 PM] szybet
see the description of the project


[4/17/2022 5:15 PM] nonasuomy
Just seems to say a light version of anki


[4/17/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
small anki 😉


[4/17/2022 5:16 PM] nonasuomy
Sanki —verbosemode


[4/17/2022 5:17 PM] nonasuomy
Maybe add to the description what Anki is all about or what it’s going to do in your idea.


[4/17/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
when it will be usable, i will add


[4/17/2022 5:19 PM] nonasuomy
Is it currently running on the device?


[4/17/2022 5:19 PM] szybet
yes, running an qt app is easy. but making it look good harder


[4/17/2022 5:20 PM] szybet
the main problem now is no sql support on the build in qt libraries, im trying to add them, look at #dev


[4/17/2022 5:20 PM] szybet
anki uses sql so i need too


[4/17/2022 5:21 PM] nonasuomy
What is the link to anki?

[4/17/2022 5:41 PM] nonasuomy
updating to 1.8 now.


[4/17/2022 5:47 PM] nonasuomy
The boot logo needs some form of loading animation to signify it's doing something.


[4/17/2022 5:47 PM] szybet
school, electronic things, leaguages, egzams etc


[4/17/2022 5:48 PM] nonasuomy
I keep hitting the home button and putting it to sleep when I think it is locked up


[4/17/2022 5:48 PM] szybet
there is a loading animation


[4/17/2022 5:48 PM] nonasuomy
maybe it's on the updated version.

I'll try one more time for giggles.


[4/17/2022 6:02 PM] nonasuomy
too bad it doesn't go into a recovery usb state where you can just dump the os back to .inkbox folder to reload.


[4/17/2022 6:03 PM] szybet
actually, in never inkbox it goes


[4/17/2022 6:03 PM] szybet
then you can telnet to it, or even an file server is launched


[4/17/2022 6:03 PM] szybet
but only with rooted kernels


[4/17/2022 6:15 PM] nonasuomy
when you do the updates do you have to do them in order?


[4/17/2022 6:15 PM] nonasuomy
or can you just go from 1.5 -> 1.8?


[4/17/2022 6:16 PM] szybet
i think no, but im not 100% sure


[4/17/2022 6:16 PM] szybet
just do 1.8


[4/17/2022 6:34 PM] nonasuomy
ok will try again just waiting for it to boot again after sd flash.


[4/17/2022 6:41 PM] tux_linux
It's not supported

D:


[4/17/2022 6:41 PM] szybet

[4/17/2022 6:43 PM] nonasuomy
in the folder for 1.6 is two files

It's literally in bold letters in the readme


[4/17/2022 6:43 PM] nonasuomy

[4/17/2022 6:44 PM] tux_linux

May cause you less headaches just to put the release version on the site to 1.6.


[4/17/2022 7:07 PM] szybet
no...


[4/17/2022 7:08 PM] tux_linux
that will be more headache for me


[4/17/2022 7:09 PM] nonasuomy
Why is that?


[4/17/2022 7:10 PM] nonasuomy
I guess if you release 2.0 as a full flash at some point then you can just remove the funny business.


[4/17/2022 7:39 PM] nonasuomy
One step forward.

[4/17/2022 7:40 PM] tux_linux
The original 1.5 rootfs didn't copy the digital signature of the rootfs which lead to an error if ever the rootfs was updated


[4/17/2022 7:40 PM] tux_linux
1.6 update fixes that with a temporary kernel that bind-mounts a scripts that copies the digital signature


[4/17/2022 7:40 PM] tux_linux
Then it can update to 1.6 and future versions


[4/17/2022 7:40 PM] tux_linux
Now you can directly jump to 1.8


[4/17/2022 7:41 PM] nonasuomy
I thought I was being smart and copied 1.8 to the card as well but renamed it to .bak but it wiped the full folder 😅


[4/17/2022 7:42 PM] nonasuomy
Waiting for the 600KB/s copy process again.


[4/17/2022 7:45 PM] nonasuomy
If you hit eject on the pc with the usb screen eventually go away or you have to physically unplug it as well?


[4/17/2022 7:46 PM] the.mightydill
pretty sure you need to unplug it, at least in my experience


[4/17/2022 7:52 PM] tux_linux
unplug it too


[4/17/2022 9:47 PM] nonasuomy
Worked this time around thank you!

this will be fixed, but there is no exit button


[4/17/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
maybe sleep will shut it down


[4/17/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
or just reboot it


[4/17/2022 9:55 PM] nonasuomy
Reboot it is I guess


[4/17/2022 10:00 PM] nonasuomy
Does usb networking work?


[4/17/2022 10:00 PM] szybet
yes


[4/17/2022 10:00 PM] nonasuomy
Not sure if I was reading something about that


[4/17/2022 10:00 PM] szybet
it works


[4/17/2022 10:01 PM] nonasuomy
How do you set that up?


[4/17/2022 10:02 PM] szybet
root the device


[4/17/2022 10:02 PM] szybet

why i didn't knowed about this


[4/17/2022 10:43 PM] szybet
diffrent versions of inkbox, even nickel on the same sd card


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] nonasuomy
So basically you can boot inkbox and the oem os from the same card?


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] szybet
yes


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] szybet
and many more


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] szybet
its a bootloader


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] nonasuomy
That is cool


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] szybet
bricking your device is impossible with this


[4/17/2022 10:44 PM] nonasuomy
Is there more than these two?


[4/17/2022 10:45 PM] szybet
nope


[4/17/2022 10:45 PM] szybet
maybe the one based on debian


[4/17/2022 10:45 PM] szybet
but its dead


[4/17/2022 10:46 PM] nonasuomy
Is the video just a PoC so far?


[4/17/2022 10:47 PM] szybet
propably


[4/17/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
Only nickel


[4/17/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
There's a repo on my GH account


[4/17/2022 11:33 PM] nonasuomy
Is nickel the name of the official kobo os?


[4/17/2022 11:36 PM] nonasuomy
@tux-linux can I test your wifi fix for n905c ?


[4/17/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/17/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
not done yet


[4/17/2022 11:43 PM] nonasuomy
Does that mean only only Nickel like inkbox can’t be booted from it?


[4/17/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
i don't understand


[4/17/2022 11:53 PM] nonasuomy
He said you could boot multiple versions of inkbox/nickel. You said only nickel. Was trying to understand if that means nickelboot can only boot nickel and not inkbox.


[4/17/2022 11:54 PM] nonasuomy
Or you can boot 1 nickel or inkbox from it.


[4/18/2022 12:03 AM] tux_linux
You can only boot Nickel, that's why it's called NickelBoot


[4/18/2022 12:03 AM] nonasuomy
Thank you for the clarification.

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/18/2022 12:05 AM] nonasuomy
Why would you want to boot multiple copies of Nickel?


[4/18/2022 12:06 AM] nonasuomy
Or is the goal to eventually figure out how to boot both and that was just the first step?


[4/18/2022 12:09 AM] tux_linux
Help other people
@pgaskin , who maintains NickelMenu, found that useful, I don't know if he will use it or not, he might not need it, but I think it's definitely useful for packagers to test their software on different Nickel versions


[4/18/2022 12:15 AM] nonasuomy

[4/18/2022 12:16 AM] szybet
Python is a problem


[4/18/2022 12:17 AM] nonasuomy
Is the python interpreter included with inkbox?


[4/18/2022 12:17 AM] szybet
It is, but it will be removed


[4/18/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
Python is a performance killer


[4/18/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
It would be better IF you rewrite this in cpp


[4/18/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
Thats what i do with sanki


[4/18/2022 12:20 AM] tux_linux
this


[4/18/2022 12:21 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet 
imgtool is working


[4/18/2022 12:22 AM] nonasuomy
Just having it available kills the performance of inkbox or just sluggish to use it to develop something and run it?


[4/18/2022 12:22 AM] tux_linux
Though it won't work for the Nia currently if you try to build an image
It needs an inkbox-update.upd.isa file which isn't currently on the server
It will be for 1.9


[4/18/2022 12:22 AM] nonasuomy
If it has no impact to the os should just be left


[4/18/2022 12:23 AM] szybet
Nice, good work


[4/18/2022 12:23 AM] nonasuomy
Barrier to entry for a lot of people to play with python code is a lot less daunting


[4/18/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
Python is not great for any embedded device
It's an interpreted language, not compiled


[4/18/2022 12:24 AM] nonasuomy
If they just want to play with some console basic hello world stuff


[4/18/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
It's just not efficient


[4/18/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
If they want to do that, they need to do it in bash


[4/18/2022 12:25 AM] szybet
This^


[4/18/2022 12:25 AM] szybet
Python is too bulky for such a device like e-readers


[4/18/2022 12:26 AM] szybet
That's the reality


[4/18/2022 12:26 AM] ninuje
*whistles happily*


[4/18/2022 12:26 AM] ninuje
Python rocks.


[4/18/2022 12:27 AM] tux_linux
hmm......


[4/18/2022 12:28 AM] tux_linux
Given that the main rootfs is a squashfs compressed in XZ format, not so sure in my case


[4/18/2022 12:28 AM] ninuje
The only significant performance cost that you'll feel more than on standard devices is the interpreter bringup.


[4/18/2022 12:28 AM] ninuje
After that, performance is similar to what it should be.


[4/18/2022 12:28 AM] ninuje
So, yeah, spawning a bunch of interpreters will be slow, but that's not really what you want to be doing with it ;o)


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] nonasuomy
They use it endlessly now for microcontrollers


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] tux_linux
yeah
well, you'll admit that bash is still faster


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] nonasuomy
Micropython


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] ninuje
Depends on what you do with it after


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] tux_linux
**Micro**python


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] ninuje
forking a shell isn't free either


[4/18/2022 12:29 AM] ninuje

btw is this also for the Mini?


[4/18/2022 12:30 AM] tux_linux
Well, in my experience with Python on eReaders, it wasn't great
Shell was much faster


[4/18/2022 12:30 AM] ninuje
Python is by no means a speed daemon, but that's not what you should use it for anyway 😉

[4/18/2022 12:30 AM] tux_linux

ye python is slow on Kobos


[4/18/2022 12:31 AM] ninuje
You're conflating the interpreter bringup with, well, everything else ;p


[4/18/2022 12:31 AM] szybet
Did you actually tryied it out?


[4/18/2022 12:31 AM] tux_linux
I'm also thinking about Gentoo's portage...


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
I have
It works fine, but I'd rather have used C++ if I would have had more time


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] ninuje
Paludis tried to rewrite it in C++. That... didn't go all that well, performance-wise.


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] szybet
Zackfreedman with his keyboard, he coded it with python and now its slow


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] szybet
So idk about the performance :p


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] ninuje
And it was written by people who were damn fine C++ coders 😉


[4/18/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
Well, let's still admit that `Calculating dependencies` might be actually longer than updating your system


[4/18/2022 12:33 AM] szybet
Interesting


[4/18/2022 12:33 AM] ninuje
It's slow, but not necessarily because of Python


[4/18/2022 12:33 AM] szybet
On the kobo??????


[4/18/2022 12:33 AM] tux_linux
no .... lmfao


[4/18/2022 12:34 AM] szybet
Good


[4/18/2022 12:35 AM] tux_linux
Python sure has some nice features over other languages and simplicity, but on embedded devices I would rather use a compiled language


[4/18/2022 12:35 AM] tux_linux
On desktop I can see the appeal


[4/18/2022 12:36 AM] ninuje
Depends on what you use it for ;o)


[4/18/2022 12:36 AM] tux_linux
examples?


[4/18/2022 12:37 AM] tux_linux
I use it for text file parsing, I haven't gotten around changing this yet, but it's incredibly slow at start because of the interpreter bringup as you said


[4/18/2022 12:37 AM] ninuje
Well, yeah, that: don't spawn interpreters for 5ms tasks ;p


[4/18/2022 12:37 AM] tux_linux
Or maybe spawn it initially and delegate tasks later...


[4/18/2022 12:38 AM] szybet
I will replace this if you dont, just for saying "inkbox is python free"


[4/18/2022 12:38 AM] szybet
😁


[4/18/2022 12:39 AM] tux_linux
I could be open to adding Python in the main rootfs
But those who want that will have to give me valid reasons why it couldn't be accomplished with shell


[4/18/2022 12:39 AM] ninuje
Readability, mostly


[4/18/2022 12:40 AM] szybet

[4/18/2022 12:40 AM] szybet
And Qt code is horrible to follow


[4/18/2022 12:40 AM] tux_linux
We focus on the end result, not how to read the code, even if reading shell is quite painful


[4/18/2022 12:40 AM] tux_linux
true too


[4/18/2022 12:40 AM] ninuje

*cough* rust *cough*


[4/18/2022 12:41 AM] tux_linux
Well, it's easy to follow when there are enough comments
But like, InkBox is not good on that point


[4/18/2022 12:41 AM] szybet
Rust is not great, but better


[4/18/2022 12:41 AM] ninuje
(counter-example of needing to be a rocket scientist to follow)

Most of the Rust code I read I didn't understand anything


[4/18/2022 12:43 AM] tux_linux
C++ is enough for me...


[4/18/2022 12:44 AM] szybet
For reading, it depends


[4/18/2022 12:45 AM] szybet
But for packaging, documentation, level to learn it its better

And the compiler is smart


*most od the time*


[4/18/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux

I still wouldn't jump to code InkBox in Rust

Fasttttttttt😏


[4/18/2022 12:51 AM] tux_linux

I won't try to imagine Plato or InkBox programmed in Python
**that** would be a nightmare

hmm hmm


[4/18/2022 12:52 AM] ninuje
I'm not saying it's necessarily a great idea, or that it would be amazingly fast, but I don't expect that it would be meaningfully slow.


[4/18/2022 12:52 AM] ninuje
And you'd be able to prototype hilariously faster


[4/18/2022 12:52 AM] ninuje
Need I remind you that calibre is written in PyQt ;o)

I've read a bit about LuaJIT and it seems nice


[4/18/2022 12:55 AM] ninuje
It's a JIT compiler, meaning it heuristically compiles stuff at runtime


[4/18/2022 12:56 AM] ninuje
Which allows it to be pretty damn fast when the JIT gods are with you ;p


[4/18/2022 12:56 AM] tux_linux
hmm nice


[4/18/2022 12:56 AM] tux_linux
maybe inkbox in lua would be nice


[4/18/2022 12:57 AM] ninuje
The native ffi support makes interacting with C libraries fairly painless (caveats may apply :D), at some readability cost


[4/18/2022 12:57 AM] ninuje
Lua's... weird.


[4/18/2022 12:57 AM] tux_linux
I like syntax though


[4/18/2022 12:58 AM] szybet
Koreader is in lua... And i have seen faster things

I nad used a kindle too, its not bad?


[4/18/2022 1:00 AM] ninuje
The most recent PB contributor simply gave up trying to do things by hand and implemented a native backend to ease most of the pain away


[4/18/2022 1:00 AM] ninuje
the Kindle's UI (and Reader) is pretty damn snappy (usually), yeah.


[4/18/2022 1:01 AM] ninuje
Despite its... fairly complex design.


[4/18/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
not on my pw3 though...?


[4/18/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
its fairly *coughs* restrictive OS


[4/18/2022 1:02 AM] ninuje
It's snappier than nickel on similar hardware ;p


[4/18/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
InkBox is restrictive, but Kindle OS is......


[4/18/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
Like, Secure Boot was a bit too much


[4/18/2022 1:03 AM] tux_linux
I'd like to implement that on InkBox, but at least provide users a way to change the keys if they want


[4/18/2022 4:44 AM] tux_linux
Ok, I think this time is the right time; I've gotten around about everything I've wanted to fix in the GUI, completed logging (it now also logs to `/var/log/inkbox-gui.log` if `GUI_DEBUG` flag is set to true), added support for landscape PDFs, fixed the timezone thing, it doesn't require any reboot anymore and implemented some fancy cinematic brightness if a different setting is set for a book.
So I think I can release 1.9 now. Finally.
Am I wrong? ^^

[4/18/2022 4:52 AM] tux_linux
Launch diagnostics mode


[4/18/2022 4:52 AM] tux_linux
There is a flags tab at the top


[4/18/2022 4:52 AM] tux_linux
Tick the USBNET_ENABLE checkbox


[4/18/2022 4:52 AM] tux_linux
(are you rooted)?


[4/18/2022 4:53 AM] tux_linux
`mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt`


[4/18/2022 4:53 AM] tux_linux
but you can enable usbnet from diags


[4/18/2022 4:53 AM] nonasuomy
how to boot in diagnostics mode seems it says you do a factory reset?


[4/18/2022 4:53 AM] tux_linux
?


[4/18/2022 4:54 AM] nonasuomy
do you just hit reset from the options menu?


[4/18/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
no


[4/18/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
you need to reboot and once the green light starts **flashing**, **immediately** slide the power button repeatedly for ~5s


[4/18/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
then wait a minute or two


[4/18/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
and diags GUI should come up


[4/18/2022 4:56 AM] nonasuomy
got to it


[4/18/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
if you need to root the device, go into reset options and reset as root


[4/18/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
after the reset is done, get into diags again and tick the usbnet checkbox


[4/18/2022 4:57 AM] nonasuomy
USBNet doesn't work unless you are rooted correct?


[4/18/2022 4:57 AM] tux_linux
then reboot without sliding the power button again and it will show up as an usbnet device on your computer with IP 192.168.2.2 by default


[4/18/2022 4:57 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/18/2022 4:57 AM] tux_linux
when on a standard kernel you can't access any shell even via serial for security reasons


[4/18/2022 4:58 AM] tux_linux
you will need to update to 1.6->1.8 again though


[4/18/2022 4:58 AM] tux_linux
maybe I can give you a quick trick without needing factory reset


[4/18/2022 4:58 AM] tux_linux
do you have access to a linux pc?


[4/18/2022 4:59 AM] nonasuomy

Sure


[4/18/2022 5:01 AM] nonasuomy
Arch Linux


[4/18/2022 5:01 AM] tux_linux
power off
put microsd card into the pc
```
mount /path/to/inkbox-update-1.8.upd.isa /mnt
dd if=/mnt/uImage-root-n905c of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=81920
echo rooted | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=79872
umount /mnt
```


[4/18/2022 5:03 AM] tux_linux
while you're at it:
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
echo true > /mnt/flags/USBNET_ENABLE
umount /mnt

[4/18/2022 5:03 AM] tux_linux
and finally
```
sync
eject /dev/mmcblk0

You just have written to an empty file


[4/18/2022 5:33 AM] tux_linux

[4/18/2022 5:33 AM] tux_linux
`sudo rm /dev/mmcblk0`
and plug/unplug your SD


[4/18/2022 5:33 AM] tux_linux

[4/18/2022 5:34 AM] nonasuomy
let me try another reader

ok
redo the steps I mentioned before


[4/18/2022 5:37 AM] tux_linux
there


[4/18/2022 5:39 AM] nonasuomy
/dev/mmcblk0  => sdb1 ?


[4/18/2022 5:39 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/18/2022 5:39 AM] nonasuomy
or just sdb?


[4/18/2022 5:39 AM] tux_linux
just sdb


[4/18/2022 5:39 AM] tux_linux
sdb1 if it is mmcblk0p1


[4/18/2022 5:51 AM] nonasuomy
should I change the IP address to the same as my lan?


[4/18/2022 5:51 AM] nonasuomy
does it do dhcp?


[4/18/2022 6:03 AM] tux_linux
No and no


[4/18/2022 6:03 AM] tux_linux
It works?


[4/18/2022 6:04 AM] tux_linux
Normally I do `ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1`


[4/18/2022 6:05 AM] nonasuomy
booting...

[4/18/2022 6:06 AM] tux_linux
ssh root@192.168.2.2
Password is "root"


[4/18/2022 6:10 AM] nonasuomy
do i say yes to the manage books when you plug in the usb cable?


[4/18/2022 6:12 AM] nonasuomy
I see under settings => storage  it says networking now


[4/18/2022 6:19 AM] nonasuomy
Hmm I don't see a usb0


[4/18/2022 6:22 AM] nonasuomy
Disconnecting the USB cable didn't seem to reset back main screen just stuck on the black screen with the USB logo


[4/18/2022 6:23 AM] tux_linux
No


[4/18/2022 6:23 AM] nonasuomy
maybe it crashed


[4/18/2022 6:24 AM] tux_linux
It will be in usbnet before you click that button


[4/18/2022 6:24 AM] tux_linux
Just reset with button on the back


[4/18/2022 6:24 AM] tux_linux
Or plug/unplug again, hit connect again, wait, unplug


[4/18/2022 6:25 AM] tux_linux
It might be enp2s2oui1 or other mangle of random things like that instead of usb0 too


[4/18/2022 6:27 AM] nonasuomy
only seeing my two ethernet jacks (1: lo 2: laptop 3: wifi 4: dock


[4/18/2022 6:28 AM] nonasuomy
oh after the crash I rebooted see something now


[4/18/2022 6:28 AM] nonasuomy
6: enp0s20f0u1


[4/18/2022 6:31 AM] tux_linux
It must be that


[4/18/2022 6:31 AM] tux_linux
Try it


[4/18/2022 6:34 AM] nonasuomy
sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.1 dev enp0s20f0u1


[4/18/2022 6:34 AM] nonasuomy
then I ssh root@192.168.2.2 and nothing.

Rebooting...


[4/18/2022 6:48 AM] nonasuomy
Hmm under Information it shows IP address: Not available  but maybe this only shows wifi...


[4/18/2022 7:01 AM] tux_linux
Don't do that
It's not for that purpose


[4/18/2022 7:02 AM] tux_linux
You're not using the right subnet mask


[4/18/2022 7:02 AM] tux_linux
It has to be /24


[4/18/2022 8:15 AM] szybet
for 1.9 its propably everything, if you want and there is a easy fix you can try to make the brightness slider bigger in horizontal orientation, but if no thats it


[4/18/2022 8:21 AM] szybet
is this for nia a thing too?


[4/18/2022 8:25 AM] szybet
yes, changing keys is needed


[4/18/2022 8:25 AM] szybet
but... its too much


[4/18/2022 8:25 AM] szybet
its an ereader... you read books on it


[4/18/2022 10:57 AM] tux_linux
Yes
It will be in the final image


[4/18/2022 10:57 AM] szybet
nice


[4/18/2022 10:57 AM] tux_linux
It's already too big IMO


[4/18/2022 10:57 AM] szybet
then thats it


[4/18/2022 10:58 AM] tux_linux
Ok thanks 👍


[4/18/2022 3:00 PM] nonasuomy
I noticed that it auto chose that when I didnt specify it and then I deleted it and put /24 at the end and it still didn’t work.


[4/18/2022 3:00 PM] tux_linux
If you try with ifconfig?


[4/18/2022 3:00 PM] tux_linux
If it isn't there, install busybox and do busybox ifconfig


[4/18/2022 3:01 PM] tux_linux
Or maybe the net-tools package on Arch


[4/18/2022 3:01 PM] nonasuomy
I don’t have ifconfig in arch Linux it’s also recommend to no longer use net tools.


[4/18/2022 3:01 PM] tux_linux
Well, if something fails, that's what I would try out


[4/18/2022 3:02 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig is not a monster that will eat you ;p


[4/18/2022 3:02 PM] nonasuomy
I don’t see what it would do differently


[4/18/2022 3:02 PM] nonasuomy
The ip is set on the adapter what more would need to happen


[4/18/2022 3:02 PM] tux_linux
I've never used ip dev set when trying Kobo networking


[4/18/2022 3:02 PM] tux_linux
So maybe it won't change
But you can try


[4/18/2022 3:04 PM] tux_linux
If it doesn't work, it's a hardware problem on either your computer or the Kobo
And I'm not sure I can help you there
Are you using NetworkManager?


[4/18/2022 3:05 PM] nonasuomy

[4/18/2022 3:07 PM] nonasuomy
good eye


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] szybet
what 😂


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig auto-ups the interface if you set an IP


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] szybet
`sudo ifconfig -s enp0s20f0u5 192.168.2.10/24`


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] szybet
thats what i use


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] tux_linux
That's why ip didn't work


[4/18/2022 3:08 PM] szybet
on arch linux


[4/18/2022 3:09 PM] szybet
you need disable network manager


[4/18/2022 3:09 PM] szybet
or stop connecting to this interface


[4/18/2022 3:09 PM] tux_linux
He/she doesn't use it


[4/18/2022 3:09 PM] szybet
so what She/he uses?

i need to disable nm in kde to stop getting dhcp address on the usb interface

It's really not much to switch over to doing everything with ip

Arch Linux is very bleeding edge it gets you in a lot of trouble but it's fun to learn how to do a lot from scratch.


[4/18/2022 3:18 PM] tux_linux
Ok nice


[4/18/2022 3:19 PM] nonasuomy
so next is password issue you said it's root for the password correct?


[4/18/2022 3:19 PM] szybet
yea, sure, and no. many apps still use ifconfig, it will be there for 10 next years


[4/18/2022 3:19 PM] szybet
yes its root


[4/18/2022 3:20 PM] nonasuomy
I've never been one to be stuck in the past just because everyone does or uses something.


[4/18/2022 3:21 PM] szybet
i use `ip` too, but if it doesn't work, there a re problems i use ifconfig


[4/18/2022 3:21 PM] nonasuomy
Always enjoy the bleeding edge like managing a constant puzzle.


[4/18/2022 3:22 PM] nonasuomy
I try not to go oh it doesn't work lets go back to how it used to be. Always try to keep moving forward.


[4/18/2022 3:23 PM] nonasuomy
In arch you usually break a lot more when you let tools manage things for you.

on the glo the file chooser ( its horrible anyway ) is not working


[4/18/2022 3:31 PM] szybet
it will be replaced for 2.0 i hope


[4/18/2022 3:31 PM] nonasuomy
It disables all the buttons while it is up


[4/18/2022 3:32 PM] nonasuomy
If the hardware button was a home button instead of sleep would probably solve some what


[4/18/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
no no no no no


[4/18/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
its window above the buttons


[4/18/2022 3:34 PM] nonasuomy
none of the buttons work on the screen except the ones in the file window

I guess reboot it is.

yea


[4/18/2022 3:36 PM] szybet
this needs to be fixed


[4/18/2022 3:40 PM] nonasuomy
Why do you need two sleep buttons? the slider power switch puts it to sleep and the home button puts it to sleep?


[4/18/2022 3:40 PM] szybet
the glo has 2 psyhical buttons?


[4/18/2022 3:40 PM] nonasuomy
this is not the glo


[4/18/2022 3:40 PM] szybet
okay, the touch


[4/18/2022 3:40 PM] szybet
the touch has?


[4/18/2022 3:41 PM] nonasuomy
The Touch has the slider power switch and the home button under the screen as seen on the image above.


[4/18/2022 3:43 PM] szybet
oh okay


[4/18/2022 3:43 PM] szybet
then it could go to home


[4/18/2022 3:45 PM] nonasuomy
@tux-linux any idea why  the password of root doesn't work with the root user?


[4/18/2022 3:50 PM] szybet
do you have a rooted kernel


[4/18/2022 3:51 PM] tux_linux
You aren't on 1.9, it is fixed there
Not as a home button, but it doesn't sleep the device


[4/18/2022 3:52 PM] nonasuomy
I don't think USBNet works without rooted kernel?


[4/18/2022 3:52 PM] szybet
propably


[4/18/2022 3:52 PM] tux_linux
Go in root and open rootfs.tar.xz (double click)


[4/18/2022 3:53 PM] szybet
arent they squashfs?...


[4/18/2022 3:53 PM] tux_linux
It's just a random file there


[4/18/2022 3:53 PM] tux_linux
It was used for the base of GUI rootfs


[4/18/2022 3:53 PM] tux_linux
(buildroot)


[4/18/2022 3:54 PM] tux_linux
It only works with a rooted kernel


[4/18/2022 3:54 PM] tux_linux
Oh


[4/18/2022 3:54 PM] tux_linux
In 1.8 root SSH login wasn't enabled yet


[4/18/2022 3:54 PM] tux_linux

su to get root


[4/18/2022 3:55 PM] szybet
there is ssh inthe normal kernel?


[4/18/2022 3:55 PM] tux_linux
No

It's designed to be locked down


[4/18/2022 3:55 PM] nonasuomy
will try after reboot hit the file manager again...


[4/18/2022 3:55 PM] tux_linux
Do this next time
The button with the book opens it


[4/18/2022 3:56 PM] tux_linux
You can open books with local storage search instead

Before I learned to be patient with the start up I would hit the home button on the bottom of the touch to see if it was doing anything which would instead put it to sleep haha... so that is a good change.


[4/18/2022 4:02 PM] nonasuomy
It would be nice if the home button was a home button but maybe they removed this off of all the other units.

[4/18/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
or just add a external battery / usb wifi adapter


[4/18/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
but thats stupid


[4/18/2022 4:45 PM] nonasuomy
Interesting idea never the less.


[4/18/2022 5:06 PM] tux_linux
Make an internet bridge via usb with brctl


[4/18/2022 5:07 PM] tux_linux
Then request a DHCP lease with the button in Settings that's designed just for that


[4/18/2022 5:07 PM] tux_linux
The Touch is the only model with a home button


[4/18/2022 5:16 PM] nonasuomy
How do you exit netsurf?


[4/18/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
Top right menu
File -> Quit


[4/18/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
Don't go in other menus with netsurf
Can make X11 subsystem crash for no reason
Just quit


[4/18/2022 5:21 PM] nonasuomy
In the picture above do you see a top right menu?


[4/18/2022 5:29 PM] tux_linux
The icon with a file and a x

[4/18/2022 5:30 PM] tux_linux
Via ssh, you can do killall netsurf-gtk2


[4/18/2022 5:33 PM] nonasuomy
So I added both enp0s20f0u2u2 (primary network cable to the laptop interface) to a bridge called brusb and enp0s20f0u1 to the bridge but doesn't seem to grab a lease from dhcp.


[4/18/2022 5:33 PM] tux_linux
Bridges are very finicky
Maybe you can debug via serial port


[4/18/2022 5:33 PM] tux_linux
Sometimes they work and then they don't work for no reason


[4/18/2022 5:38 PM] szybet

[4/19/2022 4:39 AM] nonasuomy
why does it not show the IP under system info


[4/19/2022 4:39 AM] nonasuomy
is that only looking at the ip for wifi?


[4/19/2022 4:39 AM] tux_linux
The IP is for the Wi-Fi interface


[4/19/2022 4:39 AM] tux_linux
You can check system report, it will display the IP for usbnet there


[4/19/2022 4:40 AM] nonasuomy
system report?


[4/19/2022 4:40 AM] tux_linux
sorry


[4/19/2022 4:40 AM] tux_linux
you aren't on 1.9 yet


[4/19/2022 4:40 AM] tux_linux
i'm confused


[4/19/2022 4:41 AM] tux_linux
normally in 1.9 it's settings->page2->generate system report

doesn't happen with other apps


[4/19/2022 4:55 AM] nonasuomy
ok so that’s an error message from vnc just dumping its window on top of netsurf and not netsurf?

Where would netsurf default download location be?


[4/19/2022 5:16 AM] nonasuomy
any chance you added an orientation button to 1.9?


[4/19/2022 5:18 AM] tux_linux
no


[4/19/2022 5:18 AM] tux_linux
`/xorg/root/Downloads` probably?

no


[4/19/2022 5:24 AM] tux_linux
but you can use local storage search


[4/19/2022 5:24 AM] nonasuomy
any hacks to get to that xorg/root folder?


[4/19/2022 5:25 AM] tux_linux
probably not

maybe `/opt/config` if it doesn't exist


[4/19/2022 5:27 AM] tux_linux
it won't work because you're in the `/kobo` chroot while in the GUI


[4/19/2022 5:28 AM] tux_linux
Open KTerm
```
scp /root/download.epub user@localhost:/tmp

[4/19/2022 5:28 AM] tux_linux
In 1.9 this can be narrowed down to this:
```
scp /root/download.epub root@localhost:/data/onboard
sync
exit
```


[4/19/2022 5:29 AM] nonasuomy
When I update to 1.9 will it kill my root?

What is the correlation with vnc and netsurf? Like are we looking through vnc at netsurf or something? (Why does vnc dying mean netsurf no longer functions)


[4/19/2022 11:52 AM] szybet
adding a library to get files from a zip without upacking them, and some code to handle page changing


[4/19/2022 11:52 AM] szybet
its very easy to make, they are just images

[4/19/2022 2:28 PM] szybet
i dont have a recovery partition


[4/19/2022 2:29 PM] szybet
and i will need to replace the kernel to a rooted one?


[4/19/2022 2:29 PM] szybet
can i just remove u-boot and the kernel from the update?


[4/19/2022 2:55 PM] tux_linux
I will upload an image tonight


[4/19/2022 2:58 PM] tux_linux
Probably


[4/19/2022 3:12 PM] szybet
?


[4/19/2022 3:12 PM] szybet
And this


[4/19/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
Why? Won't do harm


[4/19/2022 5:53 PM] szybet
its unneceserry, adds risk and additional writes


[4/19/2022 5:54 PM] tux_linux
Maybe
But Kobo update packages always include U-Boot and kernel


[4/19/2022 5:55 PM] szybet
becouse they are adding uneceserry risky and additional writes to their updates


[4/19/2022 5:55 PM] tux_linux
If something goes wrong you just factory reset


[4/19/2022 5:55 PM] szybet
how do you factory reset when u-boot is dead


[4/19/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
That's then the user's fault


[4/19/2022 5:56 PM] szybet
sure, but we could avoid them


[4/19/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
If it updated with battery too low, if there was a manual shutdown during the update


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
Also, a kernel update is required for 1.9


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
And U-Boot too for most devices


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] szybet
and for me, dd sometimes doesnt work, i have written a kernel, nothing happened, opened the device, writted it again and it worked


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] szybet
well sure then yes


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
The update script is more reliable than you


[4/19/2022 5:57 PM] szybet
why, what did you changed


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
On dd that is


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
Kernel load size


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] szybet
😄  we will se


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] szybet
oh okay, so the kernel now can be bigger?


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
Well until it reaches 11.5M


[4/19/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
That's the limit of the MMC space for it


[4/19/2022 5:59 PM] szybet
11.5 is better than 10.5


[4/19/2022 6:00 PM] tux_linux
Maybe it's 10.5
I don't recall exactly


[4/19/2022 6:00 PM] szybet
and this?


[4/19/2022 6:01 PM] tux_linux
Before U-Boot of other devices loaded 8M instead of 10 and the kernel size increased


[4/19/2022 6:03 PM] tux_linux
No the update script writes the root kernel if you are rooted


[4/19/2022 6:04 PM] szybet
nice, thanks for this!


[4/19/2022 10:13 PM] szybet
suprice to me, the update worked


[4/19/2022 10:14 PM] szybet
is there anything to test?


[4/19/2022 10:17 PM] tux_linux
I've still got issues with the factory images
I'll put that online tonight hopefully


[4/20/2022 12:58 AM] nonasuomy
Why?


[4/20/2022 12:59 AM] tux_linux
because I didn't find any other way to handle it elsewise


[4/20/2022 12:59 AM] nonasuomy
can't handle it like a mouse?


[4/20/2022 12:59 AM] tux_linux
and since touch input works well in Qt, I thought why not just start a local vnc viewer and send input events to x11 via qt


[4/20/2022 1:01 AM] nonasuomy
Seems convoluted to use vnc as the touch interface I would have thought x11 would already have a proper interface to accept touch input like a mouse etc.


[4/20/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
I would have had to develop the whole input driver
Which I don't really have the skills for


[4/20/2022 1:02 AM] nonasuomy
I believe in you.


[4/20/2022 1:02 AM] nonasuomy
Can you rip it out of nickel?


[4/20/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
? Nickel is using Qt


[4/20/2022 1:02 AM] nonasuomy
does nickel use vnc to accept touch input?


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] tux_linux
no, it's qt
Qt in InkBox doesn't use VNC touch input, it's native


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] nonasuomy
What is the chipset that it uses for touch?


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] tux_linux
I didn't develop the platform plugin


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] tux_linux
depends


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] nonasuomy
probably just a serial or i2c bus


[4/20/2022 1:03 AM] tux_linux
it's i2c


[4/20/2022 1:04 AM] tux_linux
sometimes elan touch or neonode zforce


[4/20/2022 1:21 AM] nonasuomy
```
1. Power on the sensor.
2. Wait for sensor to assert Data Ready pin (DR).
3. Initiate 2 byte I2C read operation. Payload of this read should be EE XX where XX is the amount of bytes toread in a second I2C read operation.
4. Read XX amount of bytes (number of bytes to read is indicated by second byte of first I2C Read Operation).Now read a message called BootComplete. The message should be
F0 11 40 02 00 00 63 0B 80 01 YY 81 02 03 YY 82 02 00 YY
where YY is usually "00" but can have another value. This signals the sensor is now booted.
5. To enable the sensor to start sending touch notifications, do the following:
a. Sending an Enable command:
EE 09 40 02 02 00 65 03 81 01 00
b. Read the response. The response should be:
EF 09 40 02 02 00 65 03 81 01 00
The initialization is now complete. When DR is asserted the sensor will send a touch notification or a newBootComplete. A BootComplete indicates that the sensor has restarted for some reason; Enable must then be setagain
```
```
The I2C Transport Protocol is very simple and identical in both directions (Read and Write). • Byte 1: FrameStart (A synchronization byte). • Byte 2: DataSize (Contains the size of the data that will be transmitted. Please note that the DataSize >= 1.The reason being that :even if the Command Data size is zero, one byte will be transmitted containing theCommandID). • Bytes 3 - : Payload encoded in ASN.1.
```


[4/20/2022 1:23 AM] tux_linux
yes, touchscreens send bootcomplete signals


[4/20/2022 1:25 AM] nonasuomy
Looks well documented https://www.micro-semiconductor.com/datasheet/0e-NN-AMC-MAXIPCEX.pdf

Linux 3.13 Supports The Neonode zForce
There's many exciting Linux 3.13 kernel features already, but we have another one to talk about today

~~Linus~~  Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de> beat you to it... https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/drivers/input/touchscreen/zforce_ts.c?id=4937e2a6f939a41bf811378e80d71f68aa0950c6 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/include/linux/platform_data/zforce_ts.h?id=4937e2a6f939a41bf811378e80d71f68aa0950c6


[4/20/2022 1:57 AM] nonasuomy
Maybe just email Heiko and ask if he will port it for your inkbox.


[4/20/2022 2:06 AM] tux_linux
there isn't only zforce


[4/20/2022 2:06 AM] tux_linux
elan, and probably other ones in newer devices


[4/20/2022 2:06 AM] tux_linux
but maybe, yeah


[4/20/2022 2:07 AM] nonasuomy
"the work appears to be done by MundoReader and Barnes & Noble."


[4/20/2022 2:07 AM] nonasuomy
Maybe they will want to deploy your os to their devices as well haha 😄


[4/20/2022 2:08 AM] nonasuomy
what is the chipset numbers for elan?


[4/20/2022 2:10 AM] tux_linux
I'm more talking about the X11 input driver
not the kernel one


[4/20/2022 2:10 AM] tux_linux
is that what we were talking about?


[4/20/2022 2:13 AM] nonasuomy
Like for the zforce the chipset is zforce nn1001


[4/20/2022 2:13 AM] nonasuomy
should say on the plastic package if you have one of those devices


[4/20/2022 2:15 AM] nonasuomy
once that is implimented x11 should just accept it as a mouse input.


[4/20/2022 2:15 AM] tux_linux
mouse is not the same as touch screen


[4/20/2022 2:15 AM] tux_linux
mouse sends relative events and touchscreen sends absolute ones


[4/20/2022 2:16 AM] tux_linux
I can't find it


[4/20/2022 2:17 AM] nonasuomy
maybe install i2c-tools and see if it tells you


[4/20/2022 2:17 AM] tux_linux
in the kernel it just says `elan-touch`

Maybe I should retry some time


[4/20/2022 2:24 AM] nonasuomy
Did you contact Henrik Rydberg <rydberg@euromail.se>


[4/20/2022 2:24 AM] tux_linux
No


[4/20/2022 2:31 AM] nonasuomy
I will beg everyone for you.


[4/20/2022 2:31 AM] tux_linux
thanks, but you don't have to
only netsurf isn't quite working


[4/20/2022 2:32 AM] tux_linux
you can create x11 extensions with other apps if you want


[4/20/2022 2:32 AM] tux_linux
I already did some there: http://23.163.0.39/bundles/kobox/extensions/


[4/20/2022 2:37 AM] nonasuomy
c64 emulator 😄 do you have video of that?


[4/20/2022 2:37 AM] tux_linux
no, you can try it out


[4/20/2022 2:38 AM] tux_linux
plug usb in -> kobox settings -> export extensions
put the two files there


[4/20/2022 2:38 AM] nonasuomy
do you just dump that in the .inkbox dir?


[4/20/2022 2:38 AM] tux_linux
and it will be in x11 apps


[4/20/2022 2:38 AM] tux_linux

What would make InkBox as smooth and quick loading as Nickel?


[4/20/2022 2:50 AM] tux_linux
disabling all signature verification (not something I want to do)
uncompressing all software packages to no compression
this would increase the system size from ~3.5G to ~6G

so... no, sorry


[4/20/2022 2:54 AM] nonasuomy
What consumes so much space?


[4/20/2022 2:57 AM] tux_linux
x11


[4/20/2022 4:06 AM] nonasuomy
What things are you working on for 2.0?


[4/20/2022 4:06 AM] tux_linux
Re-doing the entire home page (recent books, abandon file chooser, etc.)

if you're trying to do a graphics demo it won't work


[4/20/2022 4:13 AM] tux_linux
maybe a text-based game can work

Yeah, I wanted to do that, but vice emulator or any other possible thing didn't work for various reasons


[4/20/2022 4:15 AM] tux_linux
At least I got it working in text mode


[4/20/2022 4:15 AM] nonasuomy
I just thought that was just text


[4/20/2022 4:15 AM] tux_linux
actually you might be right


[4/20/2022 4:15 AM] tux_linux
but I'm not sure it likes that so much either


[4/20/2022 4:27 AM] tux_linux
If you want more boot progress, `echo true > /boot/flags/DISPLAY_DEBUG` and reboot


[4/20/2022 4:27 AM] tux_linux
But that will consume battery, so caution


[4/20/2022 4:28 AM] tux_linux
Disabling KoBox speeds up the boot process a lot

[4/20/2022 4:42 AM] nonasuomy
Is there a method to boot inkbox and nickel without swapping cards?


[4/20/2022 4:42 AM] tux_linux
it only exists on emmc devices and inkbox isn't intended for that


[4/20/2022 4:43 AM] nonasuomy
I love playing with InkBox but when I want to actually read stuff I need to go back to Nickel and feel like eventually I'm going to break the clips off this backing.


[4/20/2022 4:43 AM] tux_linux
do you have a cover?


[4/20/2022 4:44 AM] nonasuomy
yes


[4/20/2022 4:44 AM] tux_linux
you can just put it in the cover without the back


[4/20/2022 4:45 AM] tux_linux
in which way do you "need" to go back to Nickel?


[4/20/2022 4:50 AM] nonasuomy
for CBR/CBZ and wifi/beta browser to download content on the fly.

[4/20/2022 4:53 AM] nonasuomy
I'll have to review as my memory is foggy but I grabbed some books and they weren't loading when I tapped them in the file manager they seemed to show up after it crashed though.


[4/20/2022 4:53 AM] nonasuomy
epubs


[4/20/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
?
you double-click once, not more
otherwise it could create unexpected... issues
like, a random loop that never ends for no reason


[4/20/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
but you should switch to local storage search, works much better


[4/20/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
just type 'epub' for example and you'll get epubs in your local storage


[4/20/2022 4:55 AM] nonasuomy
PDF's are supported correct?


[4/20/2022 4:55 AM] tux_linux
yes, and image files (.png, .jpg) too


[4/20/2022 4:55 AM] nonasuomy
I was trying this 145mb one think it crashed as well.


[4/20/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
maybe you're pushing it *a bit* too hard...


[4/20/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
i think if the pdf weighs < 20mb you're usually safe
after that it might or might not work

[4/20/2022 4:57 AM] tux_linux
yeah, that's because some pdfs aren't respecting the standards on the location of the pages number in the file


[4/20/2022 4:57 AM] tux_linux
i plan on fixing that


[4/20/2022 4:57 AM] nonasuomy
It loaded after the crash but when you open it it says it’s the end of the document


[4/20/2022 4:58 AM] tux_linux
'the crash', you're talking about a small ascii bomb on the screen with a qr code?


[4/20/2022 4:58 AM] nonasuomy
Screen just locks


[4/20/2022 4:59 AM] tux_linux
maybe too much for the ram then


[4/20/2022 5:03 AM] nonasuomy
But yeah that's basically what I have discovered so far which work in Nickel.

Unfortunately I don't feel safe leaving the back off when the rest of the fam is using it.


[4/20/2022 5:07 AM] nonasuomy
there's a gaping hole on the left where the binding is


[4/20/2022 5:07 AM] nonasuomy
When you just put the cover on it.


[4/20/2022 5:07 AM] nonasuomy
Good thought though.


[4/20/2022 5:07 AM] tux_linux
Ah ok
My Libra is fine in the case without the back since three months...


[4/20/2022 5:08 AM] tux_linux
IIRC, it originally came from @andi


[4/20/2022 5:25 AM] nonasuomy
It would be fine if it was just me that uses it but little goober fingers would find their way in there while reading comics.

Any one running a debian/ubuntu based machine that can git clone the repo above and run the make from prstux and see if something tangible comes out? Requires docker as well.

Doesn't work on Kobo Nia (firmware 4.30.18838) · Issue #12 · dbeind...
Hello, i&#39;ve recently installed this mod but it doesn&#39;t work. I have tried everything : i have NickelMenu with KoboLauncher and they never appeared in the first place. So i edited so...
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/12-8E4EF


[4/24/2022 9:41 PM] tux_linux
next to none


[4/24/2022 9:42 PM] szybet
well, i tryied


[4/24/2022 9:42 PM] szybet
what is the repo for kobox? i want to create a issue there too


[4/24/2022 9:43 PM] tux_linux
there isn't


[4/24/2022 9:43 PM] tux_linux
and it isn't the place where you should create the issue


[4/24/2022 9:43 PM] tux_linux
it is more related to kernel/epdc


[4/24/2022 9:43 PM] szybet
Is the creator alive?...


[4/24/2022 9:43 PM] tux_linux
creator of what?


[4/24/2022 9:44 PM] szybet
kobox


[4/24/2022 9:44 PM] tux_linux
it's me...?


[4/24/2022 9:44 PM] szybet
okay, so how do I debug the issue on the nia :D?


[4/24/2022 9:44 PM] tux_linux
you can't


[4/24/2022 9:44 PM] tux_linux
I have the problem on my Libra and it just happens randomly for no reason


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] szybet
whats the exact problem once more?


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] tux_linux
the screen freezes


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] szybet
and you said once about a vnc viewer in rust, how would that resolve the issue?


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] tux_linux
vncviewer is based on qt


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] tux_linux
and qt is the problem


[4/24/2022 9:45 PM] szybet
there is no more indept data?


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
so the real issue is the vncviewer


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] szybet
from when


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] szybet
:|


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
qt breaks too when you enable X11 even if you aren't in kobox


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
this
```
[FBInk] [fbink_refresh] Failed to refresh the screen!
```


[4/24/2022 9:46 PM] szybet
what causes this problem?


[4/24/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
wrong writes to the e-ink?


[4/24/2022 9:47 PM] tux_linux
i said it, I don't know


[4/24/2022 9:47 PM] tux_linux
no, it does it even when there are no writes


[4/24/2022 9:47 PM] tux_linux
it's just like "imma stop working now because it seems fun"


[4/24/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
how would writing another one help


[4/24/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
at this point, the fix would be to write a proper X11 input handler for all devices


[4/24/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
the vnc viewer only handles touch input


[4/24/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
but no


[4/24/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
it wouldn't solve the problem


[4/24/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
I believe the real one is Xorg
When Xorg isn't running, qt works


[4/24/2022 9:49 PM] szybet
like what this error even means? nope becouse nope? or just a write to the e-ink at low level refused to send


[4/24/2022 9:49 PM] szybet
hah...


[4/24/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
I don't know, but once it fails it fails forever


[4/24/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
until you relaunch the qt platform plugin


[4/24/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
for some reason


[4/24/2022 9:50 PM] tux_linux
but that isn't the fix


[4/24/2022 9:50 PM] szybet
um, and niluje said anything about this?


[4/24/2022 9:50 PM] tux_linux
it will improve kobox and make it faster, but won't solve the problem


[4/24/2022 9:50 PM] tux_linux
yes, he doesn't know how to solve it


[4/24/2022 9:51 PM] szybet
any more detail when this error accours?


[4/24/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
no


[4/24/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
well, it can occur when the user triggers too many refreshes


[4/24/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
but it also occurs when there isn't any refresh


[4/24/2022 9:52 PM] szybet
i have one idea for this


[4/24/2022 9:52 PM] szybet
if this error accours, and im able to write something to the screen using plato's writing to the e-ink implementation, then what?


[4/24/2022 9:53 PM] tux_linux
what are you wanting to do?


[4/24/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
just try writing to the e-ink using plato implementation for writing to the e-ink


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
^after the error accours


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
you can do that? it doesn't fail?


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
i want to test that


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
try it


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
will plato run oob on inkbox?...


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
with a chroot, yes


[4/24/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
maybe it could run in the /kobo chroot too


[4/24/2022 9:55 PM] tux_linux
let me try


[4/24/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
you will acidentally port plato to inkbox ;p


[4/24/2022 9:55 PM] tux_linux
this is not what i want


[4/24/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
i know 😆


[4/24/2022 9:56 PM] szybet
will you try the idea on your libra?


[4/24/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
i'll try that on my glo hd


[4/24/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
i'll tell you if it works and you can try it on the nia


[4/24/2022 9:56 PM] szybet
i dont have now time for this really


[4/24/2022 9:56 PM] szybet

it kinda works


[4/24/2022 10:17 PM] tux_linux
it thinks it's running on a Touch


[4/24/2022 10:17 PM] tux_linux
but anyway

```

touch input is messed up too


[4/24/2022 10:18 PM] szybet
it writes to the eink something, its important


[4/24/2022 10:18 PM] tux_linux
well, i don't know if it works with the xorg bug


[4/24/2022 10:19 PM] szybet
touch... its device specific, i needed to test it for the nia


[4/24/2022 10:19 PM] szybet
you can try it with the libra, or i will try this next week

[4/24/2022 10:19 PM] tux_linux
anyway, that doesn't matter
we are only looking for eink drawing fixes


[4/24/2022 10:49 PM] szybet
I would like to know if those hacky writes would not Brick the device, damage the e-ink?


[4/24/2022 10:49 PM] szybet
Ummm maybe pinging niluje?


[4/24/2022 10:51 PM] tux_linux
There has been so many on the Libra that I don't fear for that anymore ;p


[4/24/2022 10:54 PM] szybet
But those are diffrent


[4/24/2022 10:54 PM] szybet
Fbink refuses to do something, and then we do it anyway using some low level implementation


[4/24/2022 10:55 PM] tux_linux
Then ping him if you want


[4/24/2022 10:57 PM] szybet
@NiLuJe I have worries, everything is explained above


[4/24/2022 11:07 PM] ninuje
Try the fbink cli, if it works, it's an issue with the QPA


[4/24/2022 11:07 PM] ninuje
FWIW, that's the ioctl failing (i.e. the kernel telling us to gtfo)


[4/24/2022 11:09 PM] ninuje
Or... not. See what FBInk's verbose output says, and strace the binary for ioctls.


[4/24/2022 11:12 PM] ninuje
There should be a `MXCFB_SEND_UPDATE_V2` log right before, that's the actually useful bit of logging (and it's not even verbose only)


[4/24/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
Oh, yeah, it showed that error message too


[4/24/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
(`MXC_SEND_UPDATE_V2`)


[4/24/2022 11:13 PM] ninuje
What comes after is the important part ^^

[4/24/2022 11:14 PM] ninuje
And no, you (theoretically) can't damage the screen, although given the state of the ntx epdc, never say never ;o)


[4/24/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
Okay, thanks for the answer, i will try it


[4/24/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
@NonaSuomy literally booted the Touch B image on the PRS-T1 and although things didn't display correctly (but still did), the display was not damaged when booting on the Sony software after

What a risky man


[4/24/2022 11:17 PM] nonasuomy
It did make a weird whining sound though. It blanked the screen twice and just showed the Sony loading bar and never moved forward. I’m guessing it gets this splash loading bar from the initial boot partition on the eMMC and not from the SDCard then passes it off to the SDCard which then loads the loading bar sequence.


[4/24/2022 11:17 PM] ninuje
IIRC, it's the same ioctls anyway

Soo I was able to run syncthing on the kobo with inkbox using `syncthing-linux-arm-v1.19.2` , I opened the page on another machine, synced my books, everything works


[4/30/2022 8:24 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[4/30/2022 8:25 PM] szybet
it says that `it doesnt synced` but it actually does


[4/30/2022 8:25 PM] tux_linux
really?


[4/30/2022 8:25 PM] tux_linux
nice


[4/30/2022 8:26 PM] szybet
i think a small app where its launching it, says the ip address etc would be a cool thing


[4/30/2022 8:27 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[4/30/2022 8:27 PM] szybet
its too complicated to do a full app arround it, and showing the website on the kobo also will be bulky


[4/30/2022 8:30 PM] szybet
also im writing it to `/kobo/mnt/onboard/onboard`, but it only has 500Mb, how do i increase it?


[4/30/2022 8:30 PM] szybet
i thought it will magically inrease it when i connect usb storage, but no


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
you need to `dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/storage/onboard bs=1M count=number-of-M-you-want`


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] szybet
syncing word saves, anki decks is also possible


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
no easy way to increase it


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] szybet
can i do this on the kobo / will my files be still there?


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] szybet
no to both?


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
yes / no


[4/30/2022 8:31 PM] szybet
oh


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] szybet
okay i will sync it once more


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] tux_linux
you can restore them afterwards


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] tux_linux
make squashfs backup or tarball


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] szybet
you could increase it while creating the image


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] szybet
to the stock memory of the device


[4/30/2022 8:32 PM] tux_linux
maybe

Love this project, I've been waiting to find something like this for years and just installed. 

Have one hiccup on my N905B. The file explorer doesn't resize and so I can't select the document folder when I open the reader. Anyone know a fix? Tried GUI resizing and disabling with no success. Have to reset each time.


[4/30/2022 8:53 PM] tux_linux
Double-click to open a book


[4/30/2022 8:53 PM] tux_linux

[5/4/2022 4:18 AM] a.free.radical
so can I leave the FM once it’s opened?


[5/4/2022 4:21 AM] chownr
it should close its own once a file is opened. otherwise the page gets stuck and you have to hard reset - at least that was my experience


[5/4/2022 4:22 AM] a.free.radical
Ahh yeah, I didn’t think to open a file


[5/4/2022 4:22 AM] a.free.radical
Ok so my books are under /.kobo/books (a folder I made myself) is that where I should put them?


[5/4/2022 4:23 AM] chownr
I didn't think to double click - I could just make out the buttons off screen so I tried to press them with a cotton swab open


[5/4/2022 4:24 AM] chownr
should be fine, just have to double press/click the folder I think, then same for the file(s)


[5/4/2022 4:26 AM] a.free.radical
Testing it out right now, but I ran into another issue I have, whenever I eject the kobo it doesn’t seem to want to lose the “usb” screen

[5/4/2022 4:44 AM] tux_linux
did you copy the .isa file or extract it?

Unfortunately i've discovered it is extremely laggy 😦


[5/9/2022 12:00 AM] szybet
you are the 4 person on the internet that uses this device


[5/9/2022 12:00 AM] szybet
i have a kobo nia, even ported inkbox to it. what is laggy exactly?


[5/9/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
and what version did you install


[5/9/2022 12:02 AM] lewkey_
I have version 1.9 and what seems to be laggy is loading up the reader, transition between sleeping and not-sleeping. and the X11 subsystem


[5/9/2022 12:03 AM] szybet
X11 is laggy becouse of the cpu, we can't do anything about it ( wait, isint X11 freezing after some time? )
loading up? you mean after reboot?
going to sleep is slow, it will be completly rewritten for 2.0. If you want, i already done a better version you can install on your device


[5/9/2022 12:04 AM] lewkey_
I mean after reboot


[5/9/2022 12:04 AM] szybet
its becouse its loading X11, its heavy


[5/9/2022 12:04 AM] lewkey_
I'd love to install a better version on my device 🙂


[5/9/2022 12:04 AM] szybet
do you have a rooted device?


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] lewkey_
I understand, shall live with X11 being slow


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] lewkey_
Im unsure!


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] szybet
so propably not


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] lewkey_
I just flashed the firmware onto a sd card


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] szybet
so you need to root it


[5/9/2022 12:05 AM] szybet
there is propably a guide on the wiki

I shall look for a guide

and you need to reboot?


[5/9/2022 12:06 AM] lewkey_
yep


[5/9/2022 12:06 AM] lewkey_
thats the most frustrating


[5/9/2022 12:07 AM] szybet
we cant do anything about it, we haven't figured what is causing this bug, its affecting nia and libra devices


[5/9/2022 12:07 AM] lewkey_
Oh gotcha!


[5/9/2022 12:08 AM] lewkey_
I guess i should expect this for a experimental OS


[5/9/2022 12:08 AM] szybet
you can avoid the issue ( not in 100% ) by enabling wifi, plugging it into power source and setting cpu governor to performance


[5/9/2022 12:08 AM] szybet
but it would be best to disable x11


[5/9/2022 12:09 AM] szybet
not really experimental, X11 works on other devices fine

I meant because I had chosen to use a different OS by downloading it off the internet :p


[5/9/2022 12:11 AM] szybet
the stock one doesn't have x11 at all ;p


[5/9/2022 12:11 AM] lewkey_

yea, for inkbox its only one person, and 3 persons helping a bit

I shall disable x11 for the moment. would there be an app that can access wikipedia? I have a wikipedia addiction you see


[5/9/2022 12:14 AM] szybet
1. You can write your own qt app
2. You can fork an existing app and adjust it for inkbox
3. just download pdfs of wikipedia


[5/9/2022 12:15 AM] lewkey_
So for now i have no knowledge of what qt nor how to fork. but im happy to explore. the magic of open-source is that i can learn and fiddle

Reboot into diagnostics
Reset options -> Reset as root


[5/9/2022 5:03 AM] lewkey_
Im unsure how to reboot into diagnostics, to be quite honest


[5/9/2022 5:07 AM] tux_linux
reboot the device
immediately after the light starts blinking, press the power button multiple times and wait


[5/9/2022 5:07 AM] tux_linux
make a backup of your books or anything you have on the device, it will be erased


[5/9/2022 5:07 AM] lewkey_
okay! Is 5 times acceptable as multiple times?


[5/9/2022 5:07 AM] tux_linux
yes


[5/9/2022 5:07 AM] tux_linux
you could also do it one time, but it would decrease the chances of the device actually recognizing it

Sweet it worked, im loading diagnostics

[5/9/2022 5:10 AM] lewkey_
Do you think the Onboard storage size would be talking about the size of the sdcard?


[5/9/2022 5:10 AM] tux_linux
no, the space you have for storing your books


[5/9/2022 5:11 AM] lewkey_
Im unsure what space i have allocated for books, would you say 64 MiB is reasonable?


[5/9/2022 5:11 AM] tux_linux
no, it won't be enough for updates


[5/9/2022 5:12 AM] tux_linux
put at least 256


[5/9/2022 5:12 AM] tux_linux
maybe 128m would work, but I'd rather take 256


[5/9/2022 5:12 AM] lewkey_
okay!


[5/9/2022 5:12 AM] lewkey_
I'll 256 a shot. thanks for being clear and patient with me.

Is there a good strategy to reduce the amount of glitching that happens. Sometimes things freeze and stay half printed on the screen. For example, the brightness menu is stuck in the middle of the screen.


[5/9/2022 5:17 AM] tux_linux
what do you mean, stuck in the middle of the screen?


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] lewkey_
It looks like its half glitched in the middle of the screen. As if it didnt want to fully disappear after closing.


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] lewkey_
It happens with the file explorer menu


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] lewkey_
too


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] tux_linux
please post a picture once the device has finished restoring


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] lewkey_
For sure!


[5/9/2022 5:19 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet , you should know about this?...


[5/9/2022 5:36 AM] lewkey_
It no longer says "restoring", it has now been stuck on 'InkBox' in big letters.


[5/9/2022 5:36 AM] lewkey_
Is that something i should be patient for too?


[5/9/2022 5:37 AM] tux_linux
it means it has finished


[5/9/2022 5:37 AM] tux_linux
you can start it (power it on)

Out of curiosity does using balenaEtcher remove the original kobo nia sd image?


[5/9/2022 6:19 AM] lewkey_
Im concerned if I ever feel like i want to change back, i cant.


[5/9/2022 6:52 AM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[5/9/2022 6:53 AM] lewkey_
I am to understand when I flashed the "InkBox OS" to my SD card it put a new OS onto the sim card. Im curious to know if I can still switch back and forth from the Original OS image and the InkBox OS?


[5/9/2022 6:54 AM] tux_linux
If you did backup your origninal SD card, yes


[5/9/2022 6:54 AM] tux_linux
Otherwise, also yes, but it's more difficult


[5/9/2022 6:55 AM] lewkey_
I did not back it up :/ Im glad I didnt brick my device 🙂


[5/9/2022 6:56 AM] lewkey_
Would I have to dig through the files to recover the recovery partition?


[5/9/2022 6:57 AM] tux_linux
you can't, you erased it


[5/9/2022 6:57 AM] lewkey_
Ah!


[5/9/2022 6:57 AM] tux_linux
you need to request a sd image for the nia at MR


[5/9/2022 6:57 AM] lewkey_
I see!


[5/9/2022 6:59 AM] lewkey_
Thats okay, I am satisfied with InkBox. I will make it more user friendly for myself, Szybet has a fix for the frigid transition between sleeping and not-sleeping


[5/9/2022 7:02 AM] szybet
I think he is meaning how e-ink works, that it doesnt refrrsh in 100% and the old window is visible a bit

Maybe, a photo explaining that would be nice


[5/9/2022 7:03 AM] lewkey_
I shall take a photo when It occurs 🙂


[5/9/2022 7:04 AM] lewkey_
Also I have rooted my device!


[5/9/2022 7:06 AM] szybet
I can provide it if its really needed, good that the screen works for you with mine waveshare

Still this was very stupid by not backing it up...

I see. Also, I'm unsure what you mean by "can into linux" so I would I do not.


[5/9/2022 7:10 AM] lewkey_
Im happy to research, if its a researchable thing.


[5/9/2022 7:10 AM] szybet
Can use linux, the CLI, etc


[5/9/2022 7:11 AM] lewkey_
I can a small bit! I'm not super knowledgeable by all means.


[5/9/2022 7:12 AM] lewkey_
I've just played around with it through a VM and i ssh'd in.


[5/9/2022 7:12 AM] lewkey_

[5/9/2022 7:13 AM] szybet
Also, @tux-linux  did you erased mine nickel device ID from the image?


[5/9/2022 7:13 AM] tux_linux
yes
inkbox overwrites it


[5/9/2022 7:13 AM] tux_linux

[5/9/2022 7:17 AM] lewkey_
I have it downloaded! Though i shall reset the user passwd swifty.

Get a working one and launch it, it can be a vm


[5/9/2022 8:39 AM] szybet
also for the nia, if you try put it to slepp, but touch the screen will it go back to menu?

@tux-linux are you able to add a second loading boot animation? The Sony first does the loading bar then it shows a rotational arrow circle. Not sure what it's doing between your boot animation and the home screen showing up but still takes some questionable time where you are unsure if the device is just locked up or what.


[5/10/2022 8:11 AM] szybet
weird... @tux-linux do you see it?


[5/10/2022 8:11 AM] szybet
maybe my unit is broken?

install nano,wget, unzip, curl, git, sshfs on it


[5/10/2022 8:12 AM] raycast_
Why don't you try reinstalling stuff?


[5/10/2022 8:12 AM] raycast_
Use a faster sdcard while you at it


[5/10/2022 8:13 AM] szybet
i did this so many times that the sd card is propably broken


[5/10/2022 8:13 AM] raycast_
A faster sdcard made the menus load much faster

[5/10/2022 8:14 AM] szybet
you have a nia too?


[5/10/2022 8:14 AM] raycast_
Yep


[5/10/2022 8:16 AM] szybet
can you test / tell me those things?
1. With x11 enabled, does it freeze sometimes?
2. when you go to sleep and touch the screen, will it go back from sleep?
3. battery is worse on inkbox propably?
4. how did you open the nia? with what tool?


[5/10/2022 8:20 AM] raycast_
1. No problems with freezing, only need to put it in standby while loading kobox and then get it out of standby cuz otherwise loading takes longer I guess
2. No
3. Battery usage sucks, used about 5% in around 10 minutes I guess
4. A plastic card from one of the stores near my house (I'll send a picture)

so what is wrong with my nia?


[5/10/2022 12:59 PM] tux_linux
The x11 sleep/wake fix works on the Libra too; I think I mentioned it earlier. You should try it on your Nia


[5/10/2022 12:59 PM] szybet
which one?


[5/10/2022 1:00 PM] szybet
what?


[5/10/2022 1:00 PM] tux_linux
Probably the SD card, can't see anything else


[5/10/2022 1:00 PM] szybet
w h a t?


[5/10/2022 1:00 PM] tux_linux
When it freezes, put it to sleep
Then wake it up


[5/10/2022 1:00 PM] szybet
the sd card is broken, so the screen will wake up when touched ( only when going to sleep )


[5/10/2022 1:01 PM] szybet
i already tryied that... 3 month ago


[5/10/2022 1:01 PM] tux_linux
Idk, corrupted libs or something then


[5/10/2022 1:02 PM] szybet
i flashed the image you made


[5/10/2022 1:02 PM] szybet
i can make badblocks test on the sd card ._ .


[5/10/2022 1:04 PM] tux_linux
You should


[5/10/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
it would show errors if anything was wrong

Theoretically if you don't power off before the battery hits 0% the device may be bricked forever

It sure does! and I'm not even using it (as im finding it laggy). Its just in idle position, and after a couple days it leaks all the way to zero.

Yeah, i find myself waiting more than actually reading 😦


[5/14/2022 4:10 AM] lewkey_
The things that I've noticed being the most laggy is the reader (file manager), settings, internet connection, sleep transition and book configurations (like, font size and other settings). I dont want to rant about my issues but more give you an insight to help with development.

it was almost true on my touch; don't know about the nia


[5/14/2022 6:36 AM] szybet
But why


[5/14/2022 6:36 AM] tux_linux
Do I look like I know?


[5/14/2022 6:36 AM] tux_linux
;p


[5/14/2022 6:36 AM] szybet
Sadly i cant write the sleep deamon


[5/14/2022 6:37 AM] szybet
My only quess is that the battery:
1 doesnt charge becouse the controller is to weak on the kobo
2 it locked himself up


[5/14/2022 6:37 AM] szybet
Can you measure the voltage on the battery?


[5/14/2022 6:38 AM] szybet
With a multimeter


[5/14/2022 6:38 AM] tux_linux
My theory was:
- Not enough power to power the PMIC to charge it when USB is connected
- Not enough power to power the PMIC to actually power on the device when USB is connected
When bursted with USB+3.3V it finally powers up (also half-frying my rpi, but a reboot fixes it)


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] szybet
Well frying only the 3.3 regulator on the pi


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] tux_linux
Not on the battery
On the serial ports, the voltages with USB initially plugged in are about 1.8V
When I give it a burst of 3.3V via VCC, it has enough energy to power on and it powers on, serial ports stay at 3.3V


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] nonasuomy
Some times with lithium ion batteries they just take a really long time on the charger to fix when they go to zero


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] nonasuomy
I've had that before


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] tux_linux
that one is just dead...


[5/14/2022 6:39 AM] szybet
Can you just measure the voltage on the battery?


[5/14/2022 6:40 AM] nonasuomy
Just leave them overnight and the next day the battery randomly works again.


[5/14/2022 6:40 AM] szybet
This too


[5/14/2022 6:40 AM] tux_linux
I must have left it a week


[5/14/2022 6:41 AM] nonasuomy
ok shot in the dark


[5/14/2022 6:41 AM] tux_linux
can't right now, sorry
maybe tomorrow
really late here


[5/14/2022 6:41 AM] szybet
Sure


[5/14/2022 6:41 AM] szybet
Don't make a short, you can even start a fire with it


[5/14/2022 6:42 AM] tux_linux
i must have made it more than 30 times and nothing


[5/14/2022 6:42 AM] szybet
I mean while measuring the voltage


[5/14/2022 6:42 AM] tux_linux
oh


[5/14/2022 6:42 AM] tux_linux
ok


[5/14/2022 6:59 AM] tux_linux
do I add python in the main rootfs and get a 99.05MB one or I don't and I get a 87MB one?


[5/14/2022 7:00 AM] szybet
No.


[5/14/2022 7:00 AM] szybet
Python will be removed from inkbox


[5/14/2022 7:01 AM] tux_linux
hm, I guess node can do most of the stuff python would be tailored for, if not even better


[5/14/2022 7:01 AM] szybet
Yes


[5/14/2022 7:01 AM] szybet
I can accept node but not python


[5/14/2022 7:01 AM] szybet
How much space takes it?


[5/14/2022 7:01 AM] szybet
( node )


[5/14/2022 7:02 AM] szybet
Can' you add it t p4? P3 is already too small


[5/14/2022 7:02 AM] tux_linux
it's about 14M


[5/14/2022 7:02 AM] szybet
Add it to p4


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] tux_linux
no


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] tux_linux
it's not upgradable via the update.sh script


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] szybet
Installing some packages on p3 is already hard


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] szybet
Why


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] tux_linux
because...? a year ago I did not think I would have come to install system binaries into an user data partition


[5/14/2022 7:03 AM] tux_linux
even if I added it now it would cause a problem


[5/14/2022 7:05 AM] szybet
You already have Qt on p4


[5/14/2022 7:05 AM] tux_linux
yes, it's only `update.isa` that is updated


[5/14/2022 7:05 AM] szybet
And why cant you include node there


[5/14/2022 7:06 AM] tux_linux
because first all things in update.isa are mounted in a chroot
second, it would make no sense


[5/14/2022 7:06 AM] tux_linux
maybe a good solution would be to allow a root filesystem to be mounted via nfs on boot


[5/14/2022 7:06 AM] szybet
Why do you need node on the main system


[5/14/2022 7:06 AM] tux_linux
to extract epub covers, but also for other things in the future, it might be useful


[5/14/2022 7:07 AM] szybet
Yes, this makes more sense


[5/14/2022 7:07 AM] tux_linux
like a debug dev server via http, etc.


[5/14/2022 7:07 AM] szybet
It can be done via chroot


[5/14/2022 7:07 AM] szybet
Pushing everything to p3 when it has no space is not a good idea


[5/14/2022 7:08 AM] szybet
Thats a good compromise


[5/14/2022 7:08 AM] tux_linux
without python, rootfs is at 87.59mb


[5/14/2022 7:08 AM] tux_linux
that's 336M of compressed data


[5/14/2022 7:09 AM] tux_linux
`node` binary is 67M but when compressed it amounts to ~19M


[5/14/2022 7:10 AM] szybet
Well okay but this could be good for the future


[5/14/2022 7:10 AM] tux_linux
yes
maybe you could implement it


[5/14/2022 7:10 AM] szybet
Maybe


[5/14/2022 7:10 AM] tux_linux
or maybe I can and you do the sleep thing


[5/14/2022 7:11 AM] szybet
It doesnt sound hard but i didn't did somethine like that before


[5/14/2022 7:11 AM] szybet
Yes, i want to write it anyway


[5/14/2022 7:11 AM] tux_linux
the power management daemon is way harder than rootfs mounting via nfs


[5/14/2022 7:12 AM] szybet
Its just asynchronic script written in cpp right?


[5/14/2022 7:15 AM] tux_linux
Well, ok, you can write it:
- In CPP/Go/C/some compiled language; needs to be lightweight
- Commented code (I'm not good at this, but anyways), or at least, functions that are clear and/or make sense (not good at this either haha)
- Needs to follow current sleep splashes and design guidelines
- Needs to handle critical battery alerts, to replace `battery_watchdog` (splashes for those are in `/etc/images`)
- Needs to handle idle sleep
- Needs to handle Wi-Fi modules loading/unloading on-demand, ideally without kernel panics hehe


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
I will follow the development and suggest changes if I see something useful to add


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] szybet
Sure

{Reactions}

[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] szybet
I will try to write in cpp but if i get angry i will use rust


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
rust is not really something you can use on alpine


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
it isn't in the package repositories


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] szybet
How do i show alerts?


[5/14/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
so you have to build it from source...


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
`fbink -g file=/etc/images/n306-battery_critical.png`


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
c.f. /etc/init.d/battery_watchdog


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] szybet
It could be overwritten by the GUI by accident


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
I prevented that hehe


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
`rm /dev/fb0`


[5/14/2022 7:17 AM] szybet
I will handle this. Its easier than cpp really


[5/14/2022 7:18 AM] szybet
XD but then it will not be able to refresh the screen


[5/14/2022 7:18 AM] tux_linux
it's fine, it's going to power off after...


[5/14/2022 7:18 AM] szybet
OH ok


[5/14/2022 7:19 AM] tux_linux
```
                BT_LEVEL=$(cat "${SYSFS_PATH}/capacity")
                if [ ${BT_LEVEL} -le 5 ]; then
                        "${FBINK}" -k -f -q
                        sleep 0.5
                        "${FBINK}" -k -f -q
                        sleep 0.5
                        "${FBINK}" -q -g file="${IMAGES_PATH}/${DEVICE}-battery_critical.png"
                        sleep 0.5
                        "${FBINK}" -q -s -f
                        # Prevent other processes from printing over what we just showed on the screen
                        rm -f /dev/fb0
                        /sbin/poweroff no_splash
```


[5/14/2022 7:21 AM] tux_linux
So I will implement rootfs nfs mount at boot and you can do the sleep daemon


[5/14/2022 7:22 AM] tux_linux
Actually maybe node would be something half-great for that job
Since it's based on async events


[5/14/2022 7:22 AM] tux_linux
But probably too slow as the initial interpreter bringup takes about 30s
After that, it's fast


[5/14/2022 7:31 AM] szybet
OH god 30 seconda


[5/14/2022 7:55 AM] tux_linux
Well, it's 1x30s
Average launch time after that is 1-2s

Perhaps to help with identification of what causes my device to lag and lose battery.


[5/14/2022 11:25 AM] szybet
There are propably ways in linux to measure that

What is the behind the scenes process for this?


[5/14/2022 5:28 PM] szybet
Would charging the battery with a external good charger solve the issue?


[5/14/2022 6:56 PM] ninuje
Temperature and chemistry magic in the battery mix, I would assume


[5/14/2022 6:56 PM] ninuje
I don't quite remember the details, there's possibly something smart to do to avoid condensation, too (putting it in a ziploc bag, maybe?)


[5/14/2022 6:57 PM] szybet
i think that the charger on ereaders is too weak to recharge the battery when it is abaout 3 Volts


[5/15/2022 12:27 AM] lewkey_
The things that I've noticed being the most laggy is the reader (file manager), settings, internet connection, sleep transition and book configurations (like, font size and other settings).


[5/15/2022 12:29 AM] szybet
1 file manager is being slowly replaced, its crap we all know that
2 settings... you mean?
3 internet connection: speed or?
4 sleeping manager can be fixed now ( with the one i writed ), and will bre replaced with a better one in the future
5 its cpu limited ( or maybe bad coded, idk )


[5/15/2022 12:40 AM] lewkey_
1 Sweet! 
2 The settings menu, the one opened when you press the cog on the main menu
3 Connecting to, staying connected and using the internet menu. Im unsure about speed because I have nothing that can use it.
4 Oh for real? I got the linux vm setup, so i can try fix that.
5 Im not sure either. Once I get a SD image, I might jump back into the original OS just to read some books. Though I'll definitely still be jumping back and forth.


[5/15/2022 12:41 AM] tux_linux
Please don't flash the image back and forth
It will only make your device slower


[5/15/2022 12:41 AM] tux_linux
Buy another microSD card


[5/15/2022 12:41 AM] lewkey_
😬  Thank you for that tip!


[5/15/2022 12:41 AM] raycast_
Just use two separate sdcards


[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] lewkey_
I'll have an array of SD cards!


[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] szybet
2 in what way
3 connecting to well @tux-linux, staying connected is slow?,  internet menu -> gutenberg library?
4 do you can use openrc on linux?


[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] raycast_
I'm using a 128gb sdcard for the Kobo os and a 64gb sdcard for inkbox


[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] tux_linux
Read about this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Memory_wear


[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] raycast_

[5/15/2022 12:42 AM] lewkey_
God damn


[5/15/2022 12:43 AM] raycast_
Using a u3 sdcard speeds inkbox up a lot


[5/15/2022 12:43 AM] tux_linux
it should not be slow
gutenberg sync takes time... but it's syncing, give it time


[5/15/2022 12:48 AM] lewkey_
2 I press an option (for example "▢ Always show status bar") and it freezes and I wait 10 seconds the screen refreshes and than the option gets selected. I imagine its just a slow device. 
3 I mean the device does stay connected (after a moment of being connected it seems to just disconnect), By the "Internet Menu" I mean the menu used to connect to the internet. 
4 Im not familiar with openRC though is this something I should learn?


[5/15/2022 12:49 AM] lewkey_

in that case, it would only hang forever

Nope, 10s is the timeout ;o)

Yeah

[5/15/2022 2:17 PM] szybet
what is this madness


[5/15/2022 2:17 PM] raycast_
Still doesn't change the fact that the sdcard is faster than the standard sdcard


[5/15/2022 2:18 PM] nonasuomy
I was just wondering why though.


[5/15/2022 2:18 PM] nonasuomy
going to say it's just that your other one is much older


[5/15/2022 2:18 PM] nonasuomy
has an older controller in it


[5/15/2022 2:18 PM] raycast_
Different speed class


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] nonasuomy
maybe also more wear


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] raycast_
If you overclock the sdcard bus of the ereader it would make stuff even faster


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] raycast_
Wasn't used much tho


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] nonasuomy
what was it used in?


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] raycast_
Raspberry pi for a not very long time


[5/15/2022 2:19 PM] nonasuomy
Raspberry Pi's destroy SD-Cards

[5/15/2022 2:20 PM] raycast_
I don't have any problems with that tho


[5/15/2022 2:29 PM] szybet
true^ but it *depends* on the power supply for the pi


[5/15/2022 2:29 PM] raycast_
I just hook up a 15w charger


[5/15/2022 3:13 PM] nonasuomy
All the ratings on SDCards usually just determine the minimal sequential write speed.


[5/15/2022 3:13 PM] raycast_
Baguette


[5/15/2022 3:16 PM] nonasuomy
you could technically have a U1 card with a high end built controller in it and a U3 with a lower end controller in it and the U1 card  could technically out preform it as the standards is just stating minimums but doesn't say the U1 is impossible to write at 1000MB/s

1000mb/s does sound impossible tho


[5/15/2022 3:39 PM] nonasuomy
It's only improbable.


[5/15/2022 3:43 PM] nonasuomy
It's basically like we thought phonelines could only go so fast with dialup back in the day. Then discovered dsl then the same phonelines could now go at mbps speeds instead of kbps speeds.


[5/15/2022 3:48 PM] nonasuomy
most of what the public sees for labeling is just hyperboil advertisement data. A lot of the time as well they have technology that can go way faster or know the current model will go way faster but they govern a limit for it and they throttle it so they have a new product to show the next year so the company is still showing that they are innovating without having to innovate.

Do you really need node for epub cover extraction? you can extract it and then OEBPS>Image>WCover.jpg


[5/16/2022 9:26 AM] raycast_
Just use a standalone converter


[5/16/2022 1:55 PM] tux_linux
It is never the same path


[5/16/2022 1:55 PM] tux_linux
Besides, it also gives useful info about the book


[5/16/2022 1:56 PM] szybet
do it that it will be not needed for the user to wait


[5/16/2022 1:56 PM] szybet
pls


[5/16/2022 1:57 PM] szybet
or i will need to rewrite that in the future too


[5/16/2022 2:30 PM] tux_linux
I will start in in early boot


[5/16/2022 2:30 PM] tux_linux
To speed up things after


[5/16/2022 2:30 PM] szybet
how much ram will it take?


[5/16/2022 2:30 PM] tux_linux
Too much


[5/16/2022 2:31 PM] szybet
then don't use it


[5/16/2022 2:31 PM] szybet
really


[5/16/2022 2:31 PM] szybet
there is a reason why it isin't used on any ereader


[5/16/2022 2:31 PM] tux_linux
epub-parser really provides a lot of info
I don't plan to use it just for that


[5/16/2022 2:32 PM] tux_linux
It also provides author, published date, subject, etc
In JSON format


[5/16/2022 2:32 PM] tux_linux
Besides, it will only be run when there are new books


[5/16/2022 2:32 PM] tux_linux
Or at the initial stage after the update


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] szybet
do you want the user to wait 30s till his book is added?


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] tux_linux
I will store the info in a database I guess


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] szybet
im asking^


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] tux_linux
It's similar to Nickel


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] szybet
we are not nickel


[5/16/2022 2:33 PM] szybet
when do you want to start to use it?


[5/16/2022 2:34 PM] szybet
to develop something with it^


[5/16/2022 2:34 PM] tux_linux
There will be an "indexing" boot mode which will do just that


[5/16/2022 2:34 PM] tux_linux
Also, it's not going to take 30s for each book


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] tux_linux
Once the first is done, I can just throw the rest in a while loop


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] szybet
the ideas with your epub parsing are being worse and worse...


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] szybet
im asking


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] tux_linux
With the new homepage


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] szybet
so when?


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] szybet
if its not in the next week i will write a rust library for it


[5/16/2022 2:35 PM] szybet
im trying to avoid a disaster


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] tux_linux
Rust is not compilable on the kobo


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] szybet
It is.


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] tux_linux
Not on Alpine


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] tux_linux
It won't be a disaster


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] szybet
it has a musl target


[5/16/2022 2:36 PM] szybet
it will


[5/16/2022 2:37 PM] szybet
also we can run it in chroot using glibc


[5/16/2022 2:37 PM] szybet
specify what info you want from epubs and how do you want to communicate with Qt etc and i will do it


[5/16/2022 2:38 PM] szybet
user apps will be later done becouse of it


[5/16/2022 2:38 PM] tux_linux
Good luck


[5/16/2022 2:38 PM] szybet
i can even do this in cpp of you want


[5/16/2022 2:38 PM] tux_linux
Cpp will probably be less brain damage


[5/16/2022 2:39 PM] szybet
Nope, but thats personal


[5/16/2022 2:39 PM] szybet
using another programming language becouse you need a library from it isint a solution


[5/16/2022 2:39 PM] tux_linux
Node will be used for a debug http server if specified by a flag
I might use it for other things


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] szybet
but not for something that the user needs to wait


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] szybet
its not fast


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] szybet
also you dont have much ram, dont run it all the time


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] tux_linux
It can be fast
Only interpreter initial start is slow


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] szybet
but then it takes ram


[5/16/2022 2:40 PM] tux_linux
And?


[5/16/2022 2:41 PM] szybet
how much ram do you have on ereaders?


[5/16/2022 2:41 PM] szybet
becouse i think not to much


[5/16/2022 2:42 PM] tux_linux
If it's used for static tasks, it won't consume RAM all the time


[5/16/2022 2:42 PM] tux_linux
Even for http server


[5/16/2022 2:42 PM] szybet
but it will consume some of it


[5/16/2022 2:42 PM] szybet
15 Mb is too much already

Make a standalone binary that gets the same info as epub-parser in the same JSON format so that it can be a drop in replacement in the future
+Support epub3 spec


[5/16/2022 2:44 PM] tux_linux
Node isn't for reading epubs
It's only to get the metadata

this library can extract everything


[5/16/2022 2:44 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[5/16/2022 2:44 PM] tux_linux

[5/16/2022 2:45 PM] tux_linux
In which you can't put that library


[5/16/2022 2:45 PM] szybet
yes, in the glibc


[5/16/2022 2:45 PM] szybet
why?

you use the cpp tolchain for rust

Is inkbox encryption with EncFS secure enough that it can't be decrypted with brute force software if I use a long complex passcode?


[6/25/2022 8:56 AM] koboglohduser5419
As long as you don't store any construction plans for bombs, ABC weapons or plans for future attacks or murders, this encryption is completely sufficient. ☺️  In any case, your data is better protected with this encryption :)

File 1.txt can match file 1.png
Not sure if we really need JSON here


[7/2/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
well sure then


[7/2/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
but one place for all of those quotes could be goo


[7/2/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
a repo where users can add them


[7/2/2022 3:32 PM] tux_linux
Submodule


[7/2/2022 3:32 PM] tux_linux
ok


[7/2/2022 3:33 PM] tux_linux
So it will be a submodule at /resources/quotes


[7/2/2022 3:33 PM] tux_linux
And users will be able to switch to the home screen to the quote thing without always seeing the same thing


[7/2/2022 3:34 PM] szybet
we need to remember to not copy .git file to the final image


[7/2/2022 3:34 PM] tux_linux
Compress your pngs to the max
Because otherwise the binary is going to be heavy


[7/2/2022 3:34 PM] tux_linux
oh sh--


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
qrc is file-based


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] szybet
its going to the binary?


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] szybet
cant we use it in the gui bundle?


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
Well, now it's not


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, better there


[7/2/2022 3:35 PM] szybet
20+ quotes and the binary will build for ages


[7/2/2022 3:37 PM] tux_linux
Ok, so content/inkbox/resources/quotes


[7/7/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
tested out convay - wow this is **great**


[7/7/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
i love this


[7/7/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
the obly thing is that those arrow buttons are small


[7/7/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
but eassly fixable


[7/7/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
great work!


[7/8/2022 6:47 PM] tux_linux
yeah, it's fun


[7/8/2022 6:47 PM] tux_linux

Is there a way to expand the system filesize on InkBox beyond the 1024 MiB choice?


[7/13/2022 2:53 AM] tux_linux
Yes but you need to do it manually


[7/13/2022 3:17 AM] kelladon_k
How would I go about doing that? through KTerm, a partitioning tool, or...?


[7/13/2022 3:17 AM] tux_linux
Do you really have >1G of books to store ?


[7/13/2022 3:18 AM] kelladon_k
Yes, actually. I plan on tinkering extensively with ZIM archives also

Backup everything that is currently in your onboard storage
Boot on an Ubuntu LiveDVD
Extend partition 4 of your microSD with a tool like gparted
then
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p4 /mnt
rm /mnt/onboard
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/onboard bs=1M count=<nb. of mb you want, 1024=1G>
sync
sync
umount /mnt
```


[7/13/2022 3:22 AM] tux_linux
(assuming mmcblk0 points to your microSD card, it could be sdb, sdc or something like that otherwise, check with `fdisk -l`)


[7/13/2022 8:56 AM] szybet
It works and its easy to make

[7/26/2022 1:46 PM] mklomp.
Hi. First of all  thanks for the great work! InkBox already looks impressive and I can't wait for all kinds of new features. At the moment there is one thing unclear to me: Does InkBox support wifi for N705, N905C and N613 or not? The website/wiki/github do not seem to mention this, but a post on mobileread.com does. On my N613 I indeed do not seem to see any WiFi options, although the original OS does have it. So if it doesn't in InkBox, why not? Hope to hear from you.

I&#39;ve recompiled a kernel from the imx507 sources for a Kobo Mini and Kobo Touch. All is fine but the wi-fi module doesn&#39;t want to cope with that kernel. I compiled the other modules...

[7/31/2022 3:11 AM] lewkey_
Hello! I'm currently having some serious issues with battery on the Nia, is there some strategies I can use to improve this?


[7/31/2022 5:29 AM] tux_linux
Ask @Szybet
Every Kobo kernel is seriously flawed in some way
For the Nia it seems the main problem is power


[7/31/2022 5:32 AM] tux_linux
We're developing a new power daemon and he's the main person you should talk to about that
It's currently undergoing a long process of testing/debugging/debugging/debugging/debugging/fixing but it will be working better soon to add it in 2.0 release


[7/31/2022 11:49 AM] lewkey_
Sweet! I appreciate the clarity, and you guy's hard efforts.


[7/31/2022 12:59 PM] szybet
the power daemon will fix some things for sure


[7/31/2022 1:00 PM] szybet
for nwo you can contact kobo and ask them to update the linux kernel becouse the license requires them to do it...


[7/31/2022 1:01 PM] szybet
also a note: battery life on the stock os wasn't great either for me, it was better, but suprisingly worse of what i had expexted. the nia has a really small battery inside


[8/1/2022 7:50 PM] szybet
well if you really want, you can start using it now


[8/1/2022 7:50 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[8/8/2022 8:31 AM] lewkey_
For now I think i will flash back to the OG image


[8/8/2022 8:31 AM] lewkey_
I found someone who could provide me a NIA image


[8/10/2022 1:50 PM] zalaxx
Hi guys, just a quick question. Lets say I install inkbox on my device, have I any way to reinstall the stock/default os ?


[8/10/2022 2:08 PM] tux_linux
make a backup


[8/10/2022 2:08 PM] tux_linux
what device do you have?


[8/10/2022 2:12 PM] zalaxx
None for now, I'll buy it today


[8/10/2022 2:12 PM] tux_linux
Which one


[8/10/2022 2:12 PM] tux_linux
`dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 status=progress | xz > kobo-backup.img.xz`


[8/10/2022 2:12 PM] tux_linux
I... hope you know a bit of Linux things?


[8/10/2022 2:13 PM] zalaxx

[8/10/2022 2:16 PM] zalaxx
Exactly, i wanted one a while ago but didnt know about this project at the time


[8/10/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
We currently don't support new devices


[8/10/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
The most recent we officially support is the Glo HD


[8/10/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
But


[8/10/2022 2:18 PM] szybet
because no want wants to port to them, you can help with that*


[8/10/2022 2:18 PM] tux_linux
You can buy a Clara HD and help us port it, 90% of users who proposed help for this are never online / gave up interest / didn't want to do it


[8/10/2022 2:18 PM] tux_linux
*we don't have enough money


[8/10/2022 2:19 PM] tux_linux
The Clara HD is the only device with an easily-accessible internal microSD card


[8/10/2022 2:22 PM] zalaxx
I think i'll go with that one then, thanks a lot


[8/10/2022 2:23 PM] szybet
because im me, i need to say about the nia

everything works, only battery life is worse


[8/10/2022 2:24 PM] szybet

i really don't have the energy to find the problem in the source, recompile a whole xorg rootfs, repackage 8 system images and upload that


[8/14/2022 9:48 PM] szybet
I mean, we have a binary that unlocks the eink


[8/14/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
yes


[8/14/2022 9:48 PM] tux_linux
maybe ipd could do something with it


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] szybet
We could eassly add to ipd some code


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
the platform plugin fix on the kindle with that binary's code makes it even worse


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
so


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
better put that in ipd


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] tux_linux
but when
and how


[8/14/2022 9:49 PM] szybet
But we need a way to detect if eink is locked

Does fbink dump work when the screen is frozen?


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] tux_linux
probably


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] szybet
Dumping one random pixel


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] tux_linux
it just can't send an update


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] szybet
Of the screen


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] szybet
Dumping it, getting the info from the screen


[8/14/2022 9:50 PM] szybet
We are not writing anything


[8/14/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
but how would you know it's frozen


[8/14/2022 9:51 PM] szybet
Im thinking of this


[8/14/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
well then we would be


[8/14/2022 9:52 PM] szybet
Dumping means writing?


[8/14/2022 9:53 PM] tux_linux
no


[8/14/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
Exactly


[8/14/2022 9:53 PM] tux_linux
but how do you know if it's frozen if you don't write to the screen


[8/14/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
That's what I'm asking
Does dumping work when the screen is frozen?


[8/14/2022 9:53 PM] tux_linux
it probably does


[8/14/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
Well, if not we have a solution


[8/14/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
only screen updates don't work

Which is why the place that sends those ioctls in the first place *is* the place to work it around if you can't be arsed to fix the root cause

If I would find the cause of the problem in the code, would you do the rest?


[8/14/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
Well, first, we would need to find what causes the problem


[8/14/2022 9:56 PM] szybet
Do we know which ioctl write causes it?


[8/14/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
we could know, but it wouldn't be easy to search afterwards


[8/14/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
even in the source

just grep^fbioblank or what-ever the actyual name isz


[8/14/2022 9:57 PM] ninuje
ezpz


[8/14/2022 9:57 PM] tux_linux

you were saying you traveled a bit


[8/16/2022 2:15 PM] szybet
oh this


[8/16/2022 2:15 PM] szybet
okay i will today


[8/16/2022 2:15 PM] tux_linux
might have lost it while traveling


[8/16/2022 2:15 PM] szybet
propably :/


[8/16/2022 2:15 PM] tux_linux
I can go back to these places, I will check if it's there

[8/16/2022 2:16 PM] szybet
post on facebook or a local social network about it


[8/16/2022 2:16 PM] tux_linux
I haven't lost any other device


[8/16/2022 2:16 PM] tux_linux
so
I don't care too much


[8/16/2022 2:17 PM] szybet

[8/16/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
It's `Wi-Fi`
Unless you write variable names

You also didn't showed user apps


[8/19/2022 2:05 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it was mainly to preview reader things
I'll make another complete video for the official release
Wi-Fi is not yet design-ready
And difficult to demo in the emulator

@Aramir try with this http://pkgs-inkbox.duckdns.org:25560/misc/inkbox-update-1.9-n613.upd.isa


[8/25/2022 12:13 AM] aryetis
Got stuck. I can't validate this popup. 
Repro steps :
1/ get a glo on 1.6 (with nothing installed on it)
2/ copy paste the update files and some books on the glo
3/ disconnect and update the device.
4/ once the update is done. Notice the "generating database" popup overlapping the changelog popup.
5/ get stuck

But otherwise, it works.


[8/25/2022 3:22 PM] tux_linux
Yes, you did enable it?


[8/25/2022 3:23 PM] aryetis
Yup.


[8/25/2022 3:24 PM] aryetis
I disabled it during initial setup cause I thought it was gonna work like "windows desktop scaling" aka "it will only zoom stuff, and not actually properly resize it"


[8/25/2022 3:24 PM] tux_linux
But it isn't like that anymore


[8/25/2022 3:24 PM] tux_linux
Right?


[8/25/2022 3:24 PM] szybet
yea we could disable the scalling at all

only the GUI was problematic


[8/25/2022 3:40 PM] tux_linux
my build folder was stuck at 13 Aug 2022


[8/25/2022 3:55 PM] aryetis
So I've put the files but it doesn't seem to want to update. There's no update prompt. Also the file is only 53 Mo compared to the 121 Mo of yesterday ?


[8/25/2022 3:57 PM] szybet
where fid you put it


[8/25/2022 3:57 PM] aryetis
File does disappear when I'm reconnecting it to my computer. Sooooo something must have happened

in the .inkbox folder like other updates.


[8/25/2022 3:58 PM] tux_linux
Did you sync before disconnecting?


[8/25/2022 3:58 PM] aryetis
safely ejected yup


[8/25/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux
Can you try one more time?


[8/25/2022 3:59 PM] aryetis
It worked for the previous updates. Just not this one.


[8/25/2022 3:59 PM] aryetis
I've tried twice so far


[8/25/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux

If you really want


[8/25/2022 4:36 PM] aryetis
I don't know how the update process work, but could it have messed up something ? Is this state stable enough for an update ?


[8/25/2022 4:37 PM] aryetis
Starting with a blank slate sounds easier/safer.


[8/25/2022 6:07 PM] tux_linux

It "failed to get network list" once. But worked on the second try. Racing condition much ?


[8/25/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
maybe just the adapter's fault

haven't tried it on the Glo yet


[8/25/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
now I suppose you want to get console access

well, at worst, create a hotspot from your phone with no special symbols in the passphrase

[8/30/2022 5:15 PM] aryetis
any dump file/logs I need to pass ?


[8/30/2022 5:15 PM] szybet
look at #dev, the kobo glo hd isint supported yet in the new wifi because of its wifi implementation hangs like crazy


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
you can pass /var/log/wifi.log if you want


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] aryetis
it's not a glo hd but a glo


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
also the entire /run directory


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
oh


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
well possibly the same problem


[8/30/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
did you enabled GUI_DEBUG before this happened?


[8/30/2022 5:17 PM] szybet
also, the most helpfull thing to fix this: how to reproduce it in 100% every time?


[8/30/2022 5:32 PM] aryetis
I don't even know how to do. So no
I'm trying to get those logs but I don't find them on either of the 4 partitions


[8/30/2022 5:33 PM] szybet
okay, boot flags on the wiki if curious


[8/30/2022 5:33 PM] szybet
if you have an old rootfs they are in /run/wifi_logs

serial?

I hate askign such a noob question but with the prebuilt images, which xz file do i flash first for the n705 ( mini) we had our sd card corrupt and no backup image so i thought to try this inkbox, I did successfully get the 1.0 image running but couldnt figure out the updates, as it mentioned about putting the 2 files in the .inbox folder) but the archive contained more then 2 files

[9/10/2022 5:24 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[9/10/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
how did you installed inkbox on it


[9/10/2022 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
flashed image onto the MicroSD


[9/10/2022 5:25 PM] szybet
which one


[9/10/2022 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
which version?


[9/10/2022 5:25 PM] szybet

[9/10/2022 5:25 PM] the.mightydill

[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] the.mightydill

[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] szybet

[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] the.mightydill

[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] szybet

[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] szybet
and you know how to update to 1.9?


[9/10/2022 5:26 PM] the.mightydill
yeah they said it works


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] rdf300
from 1.5 go to 1.6 then 1.9


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] szybet
yea


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
exactly :p


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] rdf300
the instructions say about moving 2 files, so i am guessing its the .isa file within the xz archive


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] szybet
@dill ? idk about that


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] szybet
i neved updated inkbox ;p


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
um


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
wait


[9/10/2022 5:27 PM] rdf300
i hope the 1.9 sorts the ui scale on the inkbox settings page


[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] szybet
for 1.9 there are massive improvments for everything


[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] szybet
for 2.0 that isint ready yet even more


[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] rdf300
thought so, i hope wi-fi is in 1.9


[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
i think you put the `isa` file and `can_update` into `.inkbox` folder

{Reactions}
👍 

[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] rdf300
ahhh can update


[9/10/2022 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[9/10/2022 5:29 PM] rdf300
http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/Update-HOWTO suggested small wording update on this then 😛


[9/10/2022 5:29 PM] szybet
i dont know about this, if it isin't there, you can:
1. say exactly whats the problem, describe it, create a github issue
2. fix it yourself. its qt / cpp


[9/10/2022 5:30 PM] szybet
i think for 2.0 its there, right @dill ?


[9/10/2022 5:30 PM] the.mightydill
i don't remember exactly. maybe you only need the .isa


[9/10/2022 5:30 PM] rdf300
i know its an in development thing so im not kicking and screaming its not there


[9/10/2022 5:30 PM] the.mightydill
pretty sure nicolas added WiFi to 2.0 yeah


[9/10/2022 5:31 PM] the.mightydill

ing


[9/10/2022 5:35 PM] rdf300
now i can see where i was confused, as on the github i downloaded and flashed 1.0, then tryed the 1.1 upgrade


[9/10/2022 5:35 PM] rdf300
but now im on 1.5 the folder for 1.6 makes more sense, as it acually has 2 files in it ahaha


[9/10/2022 5:35 PM] the.mightydill
flash 1.5, upgrade to 1.6 then 1.9


[9/10/2022 5:35 PM] szybet
you are young, young people learn the easiest


[9/10/2022 5:35 PM] the.mightydill

can_update means the software has detected that an update is available

ahhh i knew it was something to do with that . had similar embedded devices before with a file that tells it can do it

[9/10/2022 7:10 PM] tux_linux
even if the onboard file weighs 128K on the xz file


[9/10/2022 7:10 PM] szybet
?


[9/10/2022 7:11 PM] rdf300
i can still be here using inkbox for testing and will try to learn to help, but i think ill reflash my origional kobo image and expand the storage


[9/10/2022 7:11 PM] szybet
testers are really welcome


[9/10/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
we have none of them currently soo


[9/10/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
but you can expand the storage on inkbox


[9/10/2022 7:15 PM] szybet
i await explanation


[9/10/2022 7:19 PM] tux_linux
an xz-compressed system image file contains the OS itself and the onboard storage file, in about 780M size
if you want different sizes, let's say 1, 4, 8 and 16G, you would have to make **4 system images for every device, for 7 devices => 7 * (4 * 780) = 21 840M**


[9/10/2022 7:19 PM] szybet
what? no...


[9/10/2022 7:20 PM] szybet
lets only support the stock size


[9/10/2022 7:20 PM] tux_linux
then why did you say that


[9/10/2022 7:20 PM] rdf300
yes , i know that the anbernic rg350 custom firmware people  has a script that ran after the install to detect the full sd card size and run a re-size


[9/10/2022 7:20 PM] szybet
well you misunderstood


[9/10/2022 7:21 PM] rdf300
i think it  used a file (similar to your can_update) to detect that the resizer script had been run already


[9/10/2022 7:22 PM] tux_linux
you really think having the user wait for 15m after the first inkbox image flash is a good idea?


[9/10/2022 7:22 PM] szybet
;_ ;


[9/10/2022 7:22 PM] szybet
its already bigger in the image that they flash


[9/10/2022 7:22 PM] szybet
into the sd card


[9/10/2022 7:23 PM] tux_linux
we are not kobo
we don't have money


[9/10/2022 7:23 PM] szybet
where money is needed to do that


[9/10/2022 7:23 PM] tux_linux
store the images?


[9/10/2022 7:23 PM] szybet
compression?


[9/10/2022 7:23 PM] tux_linux
in their image it's a partition, not a file


[9/10/2022 7:24 PM] tux_linux
it's much easier to resize and does not damage the mmc a lot


[9/10/2022 7:24 PM] szybet
you already excluded this solution


[9/10/2022 7:24 PM] tux_linux
yes, resizing a partition takes seconds


[9/10/2022 7:25 PM] szybet
so... what solution would you accept then


[9/10/2022 7:26 PM] rdf300
maybe not on initial boot but a button in settings with a warning popup ?


[9/10/2022 7:26 PM] tux_linux
options
- switch to gpt and create p5 for onboard (probably going to be a mess)
- make an extended partition for p4 and p5 which would be onboard, translated: p4 is extended, p5 is user, p6 is onboard (will probably be a mess too)


[9/10/2022 7:27 PM] rdf300
sorry to open a can of worms


[9/10/2022 7:28 PM] tux_linux
everything is filled with worms here


[9/10/2022 7:28 PM] szybet
well okay, but this would be really complicated to implement


[9/10/2022 7:28 PM] tux_linux
the question is not whether or when a problem will occur, it's **how many** will occur


[9/10/2022 7:28 PM] szybet
i would still want bigger images


[9/10/2022 7:31 PM] szybet
the simplest, easiest solution...


[9/10/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
this is a fair solution

[9/10/2022 7:33 PM] szybet
well true


[9/10/2022 7:36 PM] tux_linux
a thing we need to do in 2023 is to design and sell our own device
because almost no one is interested in inkbox currently

that is the default scale

the 'turned off' scaling is nonsensical, it worked for devices running Nickel back in mar 2021 but now Nickel support is obsolete

[9/17/2022 11:10 PM] manuxd32
AT LAST IT WORKED!!!


[9/17/2022 11:11 PM] manuxd32
Now i just have to flash it and see if it works, right?


[9/17/2022 11:11 PM] szybet
no


[9/17/2022 11:11 PM] szybet
its more complicated


[9/17/2022 11:11 PM] manuxd32
oops hahahaha


[9/17/2022 11:11 PM] szybet
can you estabalish a serial connection?


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
well bad english


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] manuxd32
What do you mean by that??


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
just make and serial connection


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
uart


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
are you familiar with it?


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] manuxd32
Nope


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] manuxd32
Does it require tinkering with the motherboard?


[9/17/2022 11:12 PM] szybet
a bit


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
but well we can go without it


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
it will be just trickier


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] manuxd32
Better, wish i ken how to do that hahahah


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] manuxd32
knew*


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
you have the sd card right?


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
did you made a backup?


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
you have inkbox installed right?


[9/17/2022 11:13 PM] manuxd32
I used another sd card


[9/17/2022 11:14 PM] manuxd32
Yes


[9/17/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
okay good


[9/17/2022 11:14 PM] szybet
well clone the rootfs repo from github


[9/17/2022 11:15 PM] szybet
@tux-linux actually, how to replace the key in inkbox?


[9/17/2022 11:15 PM] manuxd32
From inkbox repo?


[9/17/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
yes


[9/17/2022 11:16 PM] szybet
from the same organisation


[9/17/2022 11:17 PM] manuxd32
http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/n306/


[9/17/2022 11:17 PM] manuxd32
I used this one


[9/17/2022 11:17 PM] manuxd32
So there's no repo 😩


[9/17/2022 11:18 PM] manuxd32
But one of the sd partitions is named rootfs


[9/17/2022 11:18 PM] manuxd32
Can i use those files?


[9/17/2022 11:18 PM] manuxd32

there is a script too


[9/17/2022 11:21 PM] szybet
you need to do all of that

?


[9/17/2022 11:47 PM] manuxd32
I think it might be the header


[9/17/2022 11:47 PM] manuxd32
Gonna try it


[9/17/2022 11:51 PM] manuxd32
Same error


[9/17/2022 11:51 PM] manuxd32
Also i'm not using ./cong¡fig DFLASG command


[9/17/2022 11:52 PM] szybet
it has nothing to do with it


[9/17/2022 11:52 PM] manuxd32
oops


[9/17/2022 11:52 PM] szybet
do you have installed `libstdc++`?

[9/17/2022 11:54 PM] manuxd32
Yeah


[9/17/2022 11:54 PM] manuxd32
I installed those dependencies beforehand


[9/17/2022 11:55 PM] szybet
try it in the debian container then


[9/17/2022 11:57 PM] manuxd32
i'm using the distrobox container


[9/17/2022 11:57 PM] szybet
you need to install every dependience in the container too


[9/17/2022 11:57 PM] manuxd32
I know, i've installed them inside the container


[9/17/2022 11:58 PM] szybet
im out of ideas


[9/17/2022 11:58 PM] szybet

[9/17/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
thats an error


[9/17/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
actually


[9/17/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
you maybe need to symlink too?...


[9/18/2022 12:01 AM] manuxd32
But the directory /home/manuel/x-tools does not exist


[9/18/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
you need to symlink it too then


[9/18/2022 12:01 AM] manuxd32
What should i symlink here


[9/18/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
your x-tools directory


[9/18/2022 12:02 AM] manuxd32
I don't have that directory as it hasn't been created after running the script


[9/18/2022 12:03 AM] szybet
try to run everything with root


[9/18/2022 12:03 AM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 12:11 AM] manuxd32
Looks like i als ¡o needed this library ncurses-devel


[9/18/2022 12:11 AM] szybet
does it work?


[9/18/2022 12:12 AM] manuxd32
It's still in progress


[9/18/2022 12:12 AM] szybet
okay, good


[9/18/2022 12:12 AM] szybet
you can make a pull request later to the guide that for fedora this is needed


[9/18/2022 12:13 AM] manuxd32
Oh yeah, gonna do it


[9/18/2022 12:38 AM] tux_linux
/opt/key.sqsh in initrd


[9/18/2022 12:43 AM] szybet
why is it a squashfs


[9/18/2022 12:57 AM] tux_linux
So that it can mount to the rootfs and not be writable?


[9/18/2022 12:57 AM] tux_linux
Also it contains other keys


[9/18/2022 12:58 AM] tux_linux
User apps key and kobox key


[9/18/2022 12:58 AM] szybet
okay


[9/18/2022 1:14 AM] manuxd32
Hello again


[9/18/2022 1:15 AM] manuxd32
I'm at this step


[9/18/2022 1:15 AM] manuxd32
Compile qt app for kobo


[9/18/2022 1:15 AM] manuxd32
But cd /inkbox/repo does not exist


[9/18/2022 1:15 AM] manuxd32
Where am i suppossed to get it?


[9/18/2022 1:19 AM] szybet
thats the repo of the qt app you want to compile


[9/18/2022 1:19 AM] szybet
im going to sleep, i can help you tommorow more


[9/18/2022 1:19 AM] manuxd32
Okayy


[9/18/2022 1:19 AM] manuxd32
Good night!!


[9/18/2022 1:19 AM] manuxd32

good morning


[9/18/2022 12:44 PM] manuxd32
I'm still trying to compile Sanki, but i keep getting this error when running "make"

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-4F98D.txt


[9/18/2022 12:44 PM] szybet
you need the zip library


[9/18/2022 12:44 PM] szybet
but for now you need your self compiled inkbox


[9/18/2022 12:46 PM] manuxd32
I've got the kernel compiled and downloades the rootfs


[9/18/2022 12:46 PM] manuxd32
How should i continue?


[9/18/2022 12:47 PM] szybet
unsquash key.sqsh in the kernel repo at this path

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-FAC3B.png


[9/18/2022 12:51 PM] manuxd32
OKay, i got this
```
applications-public.pem  kobox-graphic-public.pem  kobox-nographic-public.pem  public.pem
```


[9/18/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
now you need to generate your own keys


[9/18/2022 12:53 PM] szybet
and create a copy of key.sqsh but with your keys


[9/18/2022 12:54 PM] szybet
names must be identical


[9/18/2022 1:02 PM] manuxd32
I've got no idea about how to generate those keys


[9/18/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
```


[9/18/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
something like that


[9/18/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
you need to use public keys in the squash


[9/18/2022 1:04 PM] szybet
and you cant loose your private ones


[9/18/2022 1:06 PM] manuxd32
Okay, so now i've got this two keys 
```
private.pem  public.pem
```


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] manuxd32
So i replace the public.pem in here


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] manuxd32
With the one i just generated


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] szybet
yes


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] manuxd32
Right?


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] szybet
and do the same for all of the keys


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] szybet
generate 4 keys in total


[9/18/2022 1:07 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 1:09 PM] manuxd32
So now i've generated this:
```
applications-public.pem  kobox-graphic-public.pem  kobox-nographic-public.pem  private.pem  public.pem
```
Using the second command here but changing "public.pem" for the other names


[9/18/2022 1:09 PM] manuxd32
Now i have to squashfs it into a key.sqsh


[9/18/2022 1:09 PM] manuxd32
Right?


[9/18/2022 1:10 PM] szybet
yes


[9/18/2022 1:10 PM] szybet
did you used 4 diffrent keys?


[9/18/2022 1:10 PM] manuxd32
But taking out the private.pem


[9/18/2022 1:11 PM] manuxd32
I used this command 
```
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out kobox-nographic-public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
```


[9/18/2022 1:11 PM] manuxd32
But changing kobox-nographic-public.pem for the other names


[9/18/2022 1:15 PM] manuxd32
Do i need to make a different private.pem for all of the keys?


[9/18/2022 1:15 PM] szybet
i think not actually


[9/18/2022 1:15 PM] szybet
you can use one for all


[9/18/2022 1:15 PM] szybet
but be sure the name is good


[9/18/2022 1:16 PM] manuxd32
Yup, the name is the correct


[9/18/2022 1:16 PM] manuxd32
do i delete the previous key.sqsh?


[9/18/2022 1:16 PM] manuxd32
To replace it with the new one


[9/18/2022 1:18 PM] szybet
yes


[9/18/2022 1:18 PM] szybet
be sure then you unsquash it its the same as the previous


[9/18/2022 1:19 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 1:19 PM] manuxd32
Their good


[9/18/2022 1:19 PM] manuxd32
They're


[9/18/2022 1:19 PM] szybet
now recompile the kernel


[9/18/2022 1:20 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 1:21 PM] manuxd32
On it!


[9/18/2022 1:23 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 1:25 PM] szybet
now the rootfs


[9/18/2022 1:25 PM] szybet
run `env GITDIR="${PWD}" ./release.sh` as root user in roofts repo


[9/18/2022 1:26 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 1:26 PM] szybet
after this, sign it with your key `openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out rootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.squashfs`


[9/18/2022 1:27 PM] tux_linux
Did he actually upgrade to a dev version of inkbox yet?


[9/18/2022 1:27 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 1:28 PM] manuxd32
I don't thinks so 🧐


[9/18/2022 1:28 PM] szybet
what


[9/18/2022 1:29 PM] szybet
now only the update package for gui i think, right? @tux-linux


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] tux_linux
Oh ok
I think only GUI bundle is missing now


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] szybet
good


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] szybet
clone `https://github.com/Szybet/gui-bundle/tree/main`


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] manuxd32
Okay!


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] szybet
and there is a guide, and hints how to do things


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] szybet
which arent in the main repo for some reason ;p


[9/18/2022 1:30 PM] manuxd32
Thank you so much!


[9/18/2022 1:31 PM] tux_linux
Time


[9/18/2022 1:31 PM] tux_linux
Yes, I have different private keys for every of them


[9/18/2022 1:32 PM] tux_linux
Btw, dev mode exists


[9/18/2022 1:32 PM] tux_linux
But if they got that far they can continue to the end


[9/18/2022 1:33 PM] manuxd32
So do i need to rebuild the keys and recompile the kernel?


[9/18/2022 1:33 PM] tux_linux
It's not needed for now


[9/18/2022 1:33 PM] manuxd32
Oh okay


[9/18/2022 1:34 PM] tux_linux
If you have your key for at least the main packages it's fine


[9/18/2022 1:34 PM] szybet
what


[9/18/2022 1:34 PM] manuxd32
Nice


[9/18/2022 1:34 PM] tux_linux
(lack of) time


[9/18/2022 1:34 PM] szybet
he isint a developer


[9/18/2022 1:35 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, well, true


[9/18/2022 1:35 PM] szybet
okay... its there for 5 months i think


[9/18/2022 1:38 PM] manuxd32
I don't know how to crosscompile things in build 🧐


[9/18/2022 1:39 PM] szybet
look in the niAudio guide i send you


[9/18/2022 1:39 PM] szybet
just as with sanki you tried


[9/18/2022 1:39 PM] szybet
but you need to do this in qtcreator


[9/18/2022 1:39 PM] szybet
its the prefered way


[9/18/2022 1:48 PM] tux_linux
qmake && make


[9/18/2022 1:51 PM] szybet
no


[9/18/2022 1:51 PM] szybet
he need release


[9/18/2022 1:51 PM] szybet
+ qmake will be used from his main system path which is bad


[9/18/2022 1:52 PM] tux_linux
On Gentoo it's qmake5 for system
And it produces a release build by default (at least for InkBox)


[9/18/2022 1:53 PM] szybet
yea gentoo manages better versions


[9/18/2022 1:53 PM] szybet
but for centos, fedora propably too its fucked


[9/18/2022 1:53 PM] szybet
with a new version, they move all versions and kill all backwards compability


[9/18/2022 1:54 PM] tux_linux
Btw qt6 is really hard to compile
It's really different from 5


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] szybet
lets stay on 5


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] szybet
6 can even run on this old glibc?


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] tux_linux
It seems


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] tux_linux
We will have to move some day


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] szybet
not now


[9/18/2022 1:55 PM] szybet
i want 2.0 :(


[9/18/2022 5:48 PM] manuxd32
Well, i think i'm a mess right now


[9/18/2022 5:48 PM] manuxd32
Hahahahha


[9/18/2022 5:48 PM] manuxd32
I've been trying to make this work for over 40 minutes

[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] manuxd32
I've created the launch_app.sh file


[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] szybet
its for runing things on the kobo from qtcreator


[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] szybet
its not needed


[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] szybet
skip this step


[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] manuxd32
oh


[9/18/2022 5:50 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 5:51 PM] manuxd32
So now comes the "Install your custom Qt to kobo" step


[9/18/2022 5:51 PM] szybet
you need to be only able to build


[9/18/2022 5:51 PM] szybet
also skip it


[9/18/2022 5:51 PM] szybet
^


[9/18/2022 5:51 PM] manuxd32
Okay

I've copied everything from the guide


[9/18/2022 5:53 PM] szybet
well click run cmake


[9/18/2022 5:54 PM] tux_linux
why run cmake


[9/18/2022 5:54 PM] tux_linux
i don't even use cmake


[9/18/2022 5:54 PM] tux_linux
you do?

Error


[9/18/2022 6:00 PM] szybet
um


[9/18/2022 6:00 PM] szybet
idk


[9/18/2022 6:00 PM] szybet
install ninja on your system

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-1B1FA.png


[9/18/2022 6:02 PM] tux_linux
what are you even trying to compile


[9/18/2022 6:02 PM] manuxd32
Nothing, Szybet told me to make sure i can run cmake


[9/18/2022 6:03 PM] tux_linux
it seems you are trying to compile something which requires qt translations
but then you aren't compiling anything
idk


[9/18/2022 6:04 PM] manuxd32
Maybe it's because i made a proyect


[9/18/2022 6:04 PM] manuxd32
Gonna delete it


[9/18/2022 6:06 PM] manuxd32
So


[9/18/2022 6:07 PM] manuxd32
Now the "build" tab is grey


[9/18/2022 6:07 PM] manuxd32
And i can't use it


[9/18/2022 6:07 PM] tux_linux
what's `qmake --version`


[9/18/2022 6:08 PM] manuxd32
```
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.15.2 in /home/manuel/qt-bin/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/lib
```


[9/18/2022 6:09 PM] tux_linux
just cd into sanki directory


[9/18/2022 6:09 PM] tux_linux
then


[9/18/2022 6:09 PM] tux_linux
`qmake && make -j8`


[9/18/2022 6:09 PM] tux_linux
will probably work


[9/18/2022 6:09 PM] manuxd32
I've got an error


[9/18/2022 6:10 PM] manuxd32

[9/18/2022 6:10 PM] tux_linux
you need to cross-compile libzip


[9/18/2022 6:10 PM] manuxd32
How do i?


[9/18/2022 6:10 PM] manuxd32
libzip is already installed


[9/18/2022 6:10 PM] manuxd32
In case it has something to do

do this


[9/18/2022 6:12 PM] szybet
so compile inkbox


[9/18/2022 6:13 PM] manuxd32
I tried, but i'm stuck at the second step


[9/18/2022 6:13 PM] manuxd32
Bc of the crosscompiling thing


[9/18/2022 6:13 PM] tux_linux
do that in inkbox dir, oobe-inkbox dir and lockscreen dir


[9/18/2022 6:13 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 6:14 PM] tux_linux
btw, clone Szybet's rootfs repo because I didn't merge Wi-Fi yet (Glo HD issues)


[9/18/2022 6:15 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 6:15 PM] manuxd32
Also done


[9/18/2022 6:15 PM] manuxd32
Hahahahha


[9/18/2022 6:19 PM] tux_linux
did you clone my gui-bundle repo or szybet's one?


[9/18/2022 6:19 PM] manuxd32

[9/18/2022 7:11 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/18/2022 7:11 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
did it work?


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] manuxd32
yeah


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
did you recompiled the kernel with your keys?


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] manuxd32
Yes


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
did you runned the rootfs with my repo?


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] manuxd32
Nope


[9/18/2022 7:12 PM] manuxd32
Don't know how to do that


[9/18/2022 7:13 PM] szybet
i already said it


[9/18/2022 7:13 PM] szybet
but with my repo


[9/18/2022 7:13 PM] szybet

[9/18/2022 7:14 PM] manuxd32
Oh okay, let me see


[9/18/2022 7:14 PM] manuxd32
Sorry


[9/18/2022 7:16 PM] szybet
no need to apologize


[9/18/2022 7:21 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 7:21 PM] manuxd32
Done!


[9/18/2022 7:40 PM] szybet
everything?


[9/18/2022 8:23 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/18/2022 8:23 PM] manuxd32
Just runned the rootfs


[9/18/2022 8:23 PM] manuxd32
So now i've got the rootfs.squashfs.dgst


[9/18/2022 8:23 PM] szybet
you signed it?


[9/18/2022 8:23 PM] manuxd32
Yes


[9/18/2022 8:24 PM] szybet
good


[9/18/2022 8:24 PM] szybet

[9/18/2022 8:24 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 8:25 PM] szybet
`dd if=zImage-root of=/dev/sdcard bs=512 seek=81920`


[9/18/2022 8:25 PM] szybet
thats hwo you write the kernel


[9/18/2022 8:25 PM] szybet
on partition 3 you replace rootfs.squash and rootfs.squash.sqst with your files


[9/18/2022 8:26 PM] szybet
on p4 you put your update.isa in update folder ( it already exists )


[9/18/2022 8:27 PM] manuxd32
Can't write on it


[9/18/2022 8:28 PM] szybet
on the partition?


[9/18/2022 8:28 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/18/2022 8:28 PM] szybet
your user doesnt have access to them for some reason


[9/18/2022 8:28 PM] szybet
use root


[9/18/2022 8:28 PM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 8:32 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 8:32 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 8:32 PM] szybet
did you write the kernel?


[9/18/2022 8:32 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] manuxd32
using this


[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] szybet
you put the correct dev device right?


[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] manuxd32
Yes


[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] szybet

[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] szybet
a couple of times


[9/18/2022 8:33 PM] manuxd32
inside distrobox?


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] szybet
no


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] szybet
and then umount the device


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] szybet
with umount command


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] manuxd32
Under root?


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] szybet
yes


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] manuxd32
How many times?


[9/18/2022 8:34 PM] manuxd32
There's no output


[9/18/2022 8:35 PM] szybet
3


[9/18/2022 8:35 PM] szybet
good


[9/18/2022 8:35 PM] szybet
umount it


[9/18/2022 8:35 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 8:35 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 8:36 PM] szybet
inject the sd card to the nia


[9/18/2022 8:36 PM] szybet

Index.php


[9/18/2022 8:39 PM] szybet
did you replace this file?


[9/18/2022 8:39 PM] manuxd32
I've used the correct rootfs.squashfs


[9/18/2022 8:39 PM] manuxd32
And the .dgst too


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] szybet
okay


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] manuxd32
But i've done nothing with overlaymount-rootfs.squashfs


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] szybet
@tux-linux what does `overlaymount` mean


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] szybet
i dont know


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] szybet
we need to wait for him


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] manuxd32
Okayy


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] manuxd32
Thanks!!


[9/18/2022 8:40 PM] szybet
you are welcome


[9/18/2022 8:42 PM] tux_linux
small rootfs containing fuse-overlayfs


[9/18/2022 8:42 PM] szybet
1. why
2. how to recreate it


[9/18/2022 8:42 PM] szybet
actually


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] szybet
can we sign just the one on the sd card once again?


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] tux_linux
you never wondered why your rootfs can be writeable even if the squashfs is read-only?


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] szybet
oh thats this


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] szybet
makes sense


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] tux_linux
2. you don't need to create it, it's always the same and (probably) will never change


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] tux_linux
at least hasn't changed since 1.5


[9/18/2022 8:43 PM] manuxd32
😲


[9/18/2022 8:44 PM] szybet
so can we just sign it once more?


[9/18/2022 8:44 PM] tux_linux
yes


[9/18/2022 8:44 PM] szybet
ok cool


[9/18/2022 8:44 PM] szybet
@ManuXD32  on partition 2 and 3 remove overlaymount-rootfs.squashfs.dgst and sign it with your key


[9/18/2022 8:45 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 8:45 PM] manuxd32
Should i replace rootfs.squashfs on partition 2 with my own?


[9/18/2022 8:45 PM] szybet
no


[9/18/2022 8:45 PM] szybet
but hmm


[9/18/2022 8:45 PM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 8:46 PM] szybet
sign it too


[9/18/2022 8:46 PM] szybet
with your key


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] manuxd32
My bad, i missread


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] manuxd32
There's no rootfs.squashfs on p2


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] manuxd32
Okay, just resigned the overlays


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] szybet
yea


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] manuxd32
Sync, umount and try it


[9/18/2022 8:50 PM] manuxd32
Right?


[9/18/2022 8:51 PM] szybet
yes


[9/18/2022 8:51 PM] manuxd32

[9/18/2022 8:52 PM] manuxd32

[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
@tux-linux explanation


[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
i know its a fallback mode


[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
but why


[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] manuxd32
Don't know, they appeared when i took the other sd card


[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] manuxd32
Gonna reboot it and see if they dissappear


[9/18/2022 8:54 PM] szybet
really?


[9/18/2022 8:55 PM] szybet
wow


[9/18/2022 8:55 PM] manuxd32
They are from a manga i was reading


[9/18/2022 8:55 PM] manuxd32
I think it just didn't updated the screen there


[9/18/2022 8:55 PM] szybet
@NiLuJe can this be because of another waveform information in the sd card?


[9/18/2022 8:55 PM] szybet
this^


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] manuxd32
Well


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] manuxd32
They does not dissappear 💀


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] tux_linux
the screen is broken


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] szybet
nooo


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] szybet
im asking why usb debug is there


[9/18/2022 8:57 PM] manuxd32
It was working a few hours ago


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] manuxd32
Is there a way to fix it?


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] tux_linux
no


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
wait


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet

[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] manuxd32
Hahaha okay


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
insert your old sd card with the original OS


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
and try that

it will not work


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
@tux-linux


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] manuxd32
I've already tried that


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] manuxd32
They stay the same


[9/18/2022 8:58 PM] szybet
did you disconnected the battery while the nia was opened?


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] manuxd32
nope


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] szybet
and here is your problem


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] szybet
i said you need to be carefull...


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] tux_linux
Usually it happens when an error code is shown because of bad signature
so you can fix it


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] tux_linux
probably pressed too much on the back of the ereader, then it cracked the screen


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] tux_linux
you can buy another one


[9/18/2022 8:59 PM] manuxd32
😩


[9/18/2022 9:00 PM] szybet
he could even short something on the motherboard


[9/18/2022 9:00 PM] szybet
well does touch work on the original OS?


[9/18/2022 9:00 PM] manuxd32
yes


[9/18/2022 9:00 PM] manuxd32
Even on top of those lines


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] szybet
well


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] szybet
you learned something new from this situation


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] tux_linux
the lines are only horizontal?


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] szybet
also the ereader is still usable


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] manuxd32
yes


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] tux_linux
try disconnecting and reconnecting the display cable


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] tux_linux
but be careful


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] szybet
STOP


[9/18/2022 9:01 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] manuxd32
Stop


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
disconnect the battery first


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] manuxd32
Yup


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
carefully


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] manuxd32
I've already done it


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
and then press the power button for 5 s


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] tux_linux
no need to


[9/18/2022 9:02 PM] szybet
.............. yea


[9/18/2022 9:03 PM] tux_linux
I disconnected the display plenty of times on my ereaders without disconnecting the battery
you just need to power off the device before


[9/18/2022 9:03 PM] szybet
i just like safety okay?


[9/18/2022 9:03 PM] manuxd32
Any tip for disconnecting the display?


[9/18/2022 9:03 PM] szybet
like if you have a bit of static in you you can kill it eassly...


[9/18/2022 9:03 PM] szybet
wait


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] tux_linux
it's not like you disconnect the battery every time you replace the sd card?


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] szybet
i do and you won't stop me ;p


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] szybet
well i did


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] tux_linux
i must have done it 500 times
never broke one like that


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] szybet
now i have an external sd card


[9/18/2022 9:04 PM] tux_linux
and in what way is it more safe?


[9/18/2022 9:05 PM] manuxd32
Might it be because it was sleeping?🧐


[9/18/2022 9:05 PM] tux_linux
maybe
it's always a good idea to hotswap components when your ereader is turned on...............................

[9/18/2022 9:05 PM] tux_linux
force power off is sufficient


[9/18/2022 9:05 PM] szybet
here is the picture


[9/18/2022 9:05 PM] manuxd32
uh


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
@tux-linux can you describe the process in english?


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] manuxd32
okay, thanks


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
with my english i can mess things up


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] manuxd32
By any case are you spanish?


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
what exactly are you asking about


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] tux_linux
lift the black tip near the white thing in the picture


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] szybet
no, polish


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] tux_linux
then pull the connector out


[9/18/2022 9:06 PM] manuxd32
Okay


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] manuxd32
Cool


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] tux_linux
and reseat it, then lock the black tip in place


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] manuxd32
Done


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] manuxd32
So i have to plug in the battery again?


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] tux_linux
after that


[9/18/2022 9:07 PM] manuxd32
Don't really know how to reset it


[9/18/2022 9:08 PM] tux_linux
re-s e a t it


[9/18/2022 9:08 PM] manuxd32
oh


[9/18/2022 9:08 PM] manuxd32
ups


[9/18/2022 9:08 PM] tux_linux
= just put it into place again


[9/18/2022 9:09 PM] manuxd32
Okay, done


[9/18/2022 9:09 PM] manuxd32
The lines doesn't dissappear


[9/18/2022 9:09 PM] szybet
well did you turned it on?


[9/18/2022 9:09 PM] manuxd32
yep


[9/18/2022 9:09 PM] tux_linux
then there is probably nothing to do


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] manuxd32
😩


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] szybet
well as i said
1. you learned something
2. the reader is still usable


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] manuxd32
yup


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] manuxd32
Something's something i guess


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] szybet
for sanki you can even cut the upper part off and have a smaller screen


[9/18/2022 9:11 PM] szybet
but you would need to do this yourself


[9/18/2022 9:12 PM] tux_linux
or you can use the emulator


[9/18/2022 9:12 PM] tux_linux
but I suspect it's not the usecase you want


[9/18/2022 9:12 PM] szybet
still usable in my opinion


[9/18/2022 9:12 PM] manuxd32
Well, i can still read over the lines


[9/18/2022 9:13 PM] manuxd32
So it's not that bad


[9/18/2022 9:13 PM] szybet
@tux-linux does something on p4 need to be signed?


[9/18/2022 9:13 PM] szybet
apart of update


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
@ManuXD32 do you want to continue?


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] manuxd32
yup


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] manuxd32
I do


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] manuxd32
Hahahahah


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
good


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] tux_linux
`gui_rootfs.isa`


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
thats propably that


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
get the sd card


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] manuxd32
Oh okay


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
and sign this file above


[9/18/2022 9:14 PM] manuxd32
Going to


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
and sync umount


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
and try again


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
if it boots into usb debug then you can access it with telnet


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
from usbnet


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
he needs to get openssl anyway


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
so take the sd card off


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] tux_linux
it is already there


[9/18/2022 9:15 PM] szybet
dont complicate things


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] tux_linux
it's not complicated


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] tux_linux
you want safety


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] tux_linux
you're contradicting yourself


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] szybet
well actually


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] szybet
yea true


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] szybet
but the ereader is already damaged


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] szybet
he learned about safety


[9/18/2022 9:16 PM] tux_linux
once the display becomes cracked, it is very fragile


[9/18/2022 9:17 PM] tux_linux
everything can make it worse


[9/18/2022 9:17 PM] szybet
:/


[9/18/2022 9:24 PM] manuxd32
Okay, usb debug has appeared again


[9/18/2022 9:24 PM] manuxd32
Do i use telnet?


[9/18/2022 9:24 PM] tux_linux
yes


[9/18/2022 9:25 PM] manuxd32
okay


[9/18/2022 9:25 PM] tux_linux
interface ip 192.168.2.2


[9/18/2022 9:25 PM] tux_linux
so you need to configure your computer to be 192.168.2.1


[9/18/2022 9:26 PM] szybet
i have no idea then what went wrong


[9/18/2022 9:27 PM] manuxd32
Uhhhm don't know how to do that


[9/18/2022 9:27 PM] tux_linux
`ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1`


[9/18/2022 9:27 PM] tux_linux
and turn off NetworkManager


[9/18/2022 9:34 PM] manuxd32
Connection refused


[9/18/2022 9:34 PM] tux_linux
`ifconfig -a`?

are you using ethernet? or wifi?


[9/18/2022 9:37 PM] manuxd32
Wifi


[9/18/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
then you need to use enp4s0f3u2


[9/18/2022 9:37 PM] manuxd32
But i've disconected it


[9/18/2022 9:38 PM] manuxd32

[9/18/2022 9:38 PM] manuxd32
Now what?


[9/18/2022 9:38 PM] manuxd32
It says inkbox login


[9/18/2022 9:39 PM] tux_linux
`root`, then enter

`NetworkManager`


[9/18/2022 9:45 PM] szybet

[9/18/2022 9:47 PM] manuxd32
Well, it worked, i'm inside

No signature to verify: use the -signature option

[9/18/2022 9:51 PM] manuxd32
Do i use it?

[p4] is your mounted fourth partition


[9/18/2022 10:08 PM] szybet
you need to rerplace that


[9/18/2022 10:08 PM] manuxd32
But the kobo is not mounted


[9/18/2022 10:13 PM] tux_linux
`mount /dev/mmcblk0p4 /mnt`

[9/18/2022 10:50 PM] manuxd32
When you told me yes

then what is the output of `dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 skip=79872 count=1`?

we did make him reseat it

[9/19/2022 12:39 AM] ninuje
A few pins or whatever those are called torn then?


[9/19/2022 12:39 AM] ninuje
The few vertical ones are slightly more worrisome


[9/19/2022 12:39 AM] tux_linux
Maybe


[9/19/2022 12:40 AM] ninuje
Unless it's a very very very neat substrate crack


[9/19/2022 12:40 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[9/19/2022 12:40 AM] tux_linux
it is looking a bit strange


[9/19/2022 12:40 AM] ninuje
Which I guess could happen if the glass had a perfect fault-line


[9/19/2022 12:41 AM] ninuje
But it's usually more jagged when it actually cracks


[9/19/2022 12:49 AM] manuxd32
So is there still a chance that it can be fixed??


[9/19/2022 12:49 AM] manuxd32
Also, no luck with this


[9/19/2022 12:49 AM] manuxd32
Still stuck


[9/19/2022 12:49 AM] tux_linux
what is sh -x output?


[9/19/2022 12:49 AM] manuxd32
I think that something in the process must have deleted some files


[9/19/2022 12:50 AM] manuxd32
Like the gui or update ones


[9/19/2022 12:50 AM] manuxd32
So maybe that's the problem

arm-kobo-linux-gnueabihf ?

im sure its written in the channels i writed you  yesterday


[12/12/2022 9:50 PM] slalamander

outputs number of your threads in cpu


[12/12/2022 9:53 PM] slalamander
Yeah, but is that what you meant with the keys I had to replace? 😅 Or does it have to do with the `root` and/or `env` part you changed?


[12/12/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
your problem was toolchain and target variabler


[12/14/2022 4:06 PM] szybet
and?...


[12/14/2022 5:14 PM] slalamander
Currently working on the bootloader


[12/14/2022 5:14 PM] slalamander
I've created a .bin file, currently working out how to get the partitions correct


[12/14/2022 7:47 PM] szybet
well just talk to me


[12/14/2022 7:47 PM] szybet
because as i said, you dont need partitions if you already have an inkbox install


[12/14/2022 7:47 PM] szybet
did you replaced the keys in the kernel?


[12/14/2022 7:48 PM] szybet
also bootloader also isin't needed, but cool that you are figuring this out


[12/15/2022 10:17 AM] slalamander
Ah haven't gotten to that part yet. If I find time today (have some studying to do, so not sure) I'll get started on that.

[12/15/2022 10:19 AM] slalamander
I did miss the part about not needing the partitions, but eh, it's honestly quite interesting and useful to learn all this :)


[12/16/2022 12:13 PM] slalamander
Didn't get the screen to flash with the bootloader I compiled, so leaving that for the moment. Currently on the rootfs, I created the keys using the commands from the Nia manual, however when trying to sign it I get an error saying that `rootfs.squashfs` does not exist (it isn't in the file tree either).


[12/16/2022 12:14 PM] slalamander
`sudo openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out rootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.s
quashfs` error throws after this command


[12/16/2022 1:28 PM] szybet
you need first to create the rootfs


[12/16/2022 1:28 PM] szybet
maybe first focus on the kernel


[12/16/2022 1:28 PM] szybet
and bootloader


[12/16/2022 1:28 PM] szybet
maybe try to get a serial connection with u-boot?

I mean there's a bunch ...


[12/21/2022 8:27 PM] aryetis
I wouldn't say pokemon is necessarily horrible, but it's definetly over-hyped and its success a result of a crushing marketing campaign.


[12/21/2022 8:27 PM] aryetis
I didn't miss growing without it even when it was at its peak of popularity.


[12/21/2022 8:29 PM] aryetis
But just in case, trying to keep it down to "stuff that a kid might like and I can think off the top of my head cause I watched them back then"  : 
- toy story
- chicken run
- pretty much every ghibli, comix wave, Satoshi Kon
- The Black Cauldron
- Wolfwalkers
- shrek

[12/21/2022 8:31 PM] aryetis
Not necessarily smart requiring some literature degree / ton of culture that you don't have as a kid.


[12/21/2022 8:33 PM] szybet
i dont see much diffrence between pokemon and shrek in the sense of stupid / smart


[12/21/2022 8:33 PM] aryetis
Whereas Pokemon as I remember was cheap looking (even for back then), really bad dialogue lots of yelling / high pitched voices for no reasons (was watching true-french dubbed version of course)... And the message conveyed was "yeaaaaah power of friendship and trusting strangers is fun, go on an adventure kids and don't forget to make animals fight each others"


[12/21/2022 8:34 PM] szybet
... shrek has literally a race war


[12/21/2022 8:39 PM] aryetis
Shrek ... I guess you had to be there at that time.
It was : 
- one of the first computer generated movies that wasn't looking like absolute trash
- it was written for both kids and adults. Kids wouldn't miss a reference and feel dumb about not getting but parents would definitely catch them
- it was obviously a parody / retelling of the old same princess tale but modernised
- and yes it tackled some subject such as race war... Yet it wasn't so much in your face as to bore the kid, nor trying to take itself too seriously and become a documentary. It walked the line pretty well.

Would I consider it a masterpiece, must watch, kiss chef, such a chef d'oeuvre. Meh probably not but it's definetly worth a watch and wasn't taking kids for big big dummies but instead future adults with functioning brain.


[12/21/2022 8:41 PM] aryetis
ps : I haven't watched any of the pokemon OAV. My knowledge of pokemon consists of ... parts of the first two seasons. The card game (that was dope), and video games that I played on friend's gameboy.


[12/21/2022 8:42 PM] aryetis
Sorry Nicolas for erasing your game save by the way... But how was I supposed to know that "new game" doesn't mean "sure here you can try to the game from the start until you save" but actually meant "oh surely you meant 'I want to erase all of my saves' AND start a new game".

on top of the alpine base to make it work on the kobo

you mean below alpine
1. uboot
2. kernel provided by the manufacturer, custon modified to make it work

2.0 isint released yet, unnoficial with missing features, but its almost there


[2/17/2023 3:51 PM] szybet
you need to compile it yourself


[3/7/2023 10:50 AM] shwanzy.
hi everyone! new to this channel, just a quick summary of my experience so far:


[3/7/2023 10:53 AM] szybet
Hi, please also provide the version, maybe your problems are fixed


[3/7/2023 11:02 AM] shwanzy.
First of all inkbox works on the tolino shine! Because that is basically a kobo glo rebranded. Everything works, except the backlight button not doing anything. I think that's really huge, because tolino is really, really popular here in Germany. I think the tolino shine 2 hd (= kobo glo hd) and toline page 2 (= kobo nia) might work out of the box as well, but I do not have the hardware to try it out. Using the latest version 1.9 now. One big disadvantage is that I do not seem to have wifi. Is wifi working on the kobo glo? That's the only real downside compared to the stock firmware currently. Support for different languages would be nice, but english is fine for me, too. I also figured out how to make the usb storage larger, should I add that info to the wiki somewhere? That's all, inkbox has been awesome so far!

👍 (2) 

[3/7/2023 11:26 AM] szybet
Cool to know about tolino! If you want, you can add support for the button if you know a bit about linux and programming

Wifi was figured out, but i dont know if for 1.9. Please see release notes for this, if not, you need to update to latest dev version to enable wifi. For 2.0 it will be there

We also know about the hack for making it larger, we plan to automate the process in the future. You can add it to the wiki for sure, any contributions are welcome


[3/7/2023 11:28 AM] szybet
@tux-linux maybe adding that tolinos work too propably is a good idea?


[3/7/2023 11:31 AM] shwanzy.
tolino shine confirmed working, page 2 and shine 2 hd just my suspicion that they work, probably someone should try it first! Maybe me if I get one for cheap. I got ok linux knowledge I'd say and minimal programming skills. Could you point me in the right direction to getting the backlight button to do something?


[3/7/2023 11:33 AM] szybet
It depends of what do you want it to do


[3/7/2023 11:34 AM] szybet
Well if i could get any ereader for cheap i would buy it and port it


[3/7/2023 11:39 AM] shwanzy.
well on the stock firmware this button toggles the backlight on and off, and the brightness of the backlight is set in the gui. Would be nice to have that functionality, or even better: Have it toggle through backlight off and different brightness settings (10%, 20%, ...) when pressing the button.


[3/7/2023 11:40 AM] shwanzy.
good attitude 😄 I just started using inkbox because I got the tolino shine for <10€.


[3/7/2023 11:40 AM] szybet
This is easly done with inkbox power daemon, you can add it, basic cpp required


[3/7/2023 11:40 AM] szybet
There are already functions, watcher, like one additional int and an if

Woah, i have been ssarching for a damaged - but repeirable one and i couldnt find anything at that price


[3/7/2023 11:46 AM] shwanzy.
will see if I can figure it out!


[3/7/2023 11:50 AM] shwanzy.
tbf I got one with a broken screen for free, and got one with broken everything but screen for <10€. But here in germany you get them in working condition for around 10€ all the time. Spoiler: You will most likely break the front housing when opening it, if it's not already broken. At least that happened to me on both devices, the material is just very weak. You might have to 3d print a replacement and that might or might not be better, we will see in a few days!


[3/7/2023 12:03 PM] szybet
For kobo its not the case with... The case

We need to test it first...


[3/7/2023 1:05 PM] szybet
This one works for sure


[3/7/2023 1:05 PM] szybet
Will the sellers sent it to poland?


[3/7/2023 1:20 PM] shwanzy.
i don't know, almost everyone is a private seller, you can ask them! All I can tell you is prices: regular package to poland without insurance is 6€ with DHL, might even get it cheaper if you send it as "big letter" or something. Parcel with insurance is around 10€ with DPD or Hermes.


[3/7/2023 1:20 PM] shwanzy.
If you want I can keep an eye out for a cheap tolino shine and send it to you.


[3/7/2023 1:59 PM] szybet
Im looking out for any regularly, even for damaged ones, i can repair them propably if its not the screen


[3/7/2023 1:59 PM] szybet
But if you would found one, send it for sure, thanks


[3/7/2023 2:22 PM] szybet
Big letter... This needs to be bubble wrapped for the eink display to survive


[3/7/2023 2:33 PM] shwanzy.
nah i was wrong big letter international is for documents only it seems, 6€ with dhl the cheapest option i can find.


[3/7/2023 2:34 PM] szybet
Its still a good price


[3/7/2023 2:34 PM] szybet
What does VB as price stand for


[3/7/2023 2:59 PM] shwanzy.
"verhandlungsbasis", meaning price can be negotiated.


[3/7/2023 3:01 PM] szybet
Cool, but i wobt try because im not interested in those books on it


[3/7/2023 3:01 PM] szybet

not sure I think it's just the ce notified body number

not a model number


[3/7/2023 9:34 PM] shwanzy.
its a cute little thing, only downside really is the cheap plastic! Internals seem to be fine, considering how old it is and still working fine.


[3/7/2023 9:35 PM] szybet
well then no code number then


[3/7/2023 9:45 PM] shwanzy.
Not really. There is a serial number that seems to be a different one for every device. And you can just look it up in the stock os, not printed on the hardware itself. And last but not least: There are two different versions of the shine. There is almost no difference between them. The second version has a butterfly on the case, most of the times the first version does not. Only way to know for sure is looking at serial number: if it's below 20311241 it's the older revision. Hardware wise the only difference seems to be the second version being able to refresh screen every 6 pages instead of every 8 pages. That's it.

yeah just writing it down for the record ^^ I guess as long as there are no issues with the screen for anyone, no reason to differentiate.


[3/7/2023 9:47 PM] shwanzy.
btw how cool is micro sd card as internal storage? why isn't it always like this with phones etc? Really awesome.


[3/7/2023 9:48 PM] szybet
size i think, but yea its awesome


[3/7/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
is there a second storage inside?


[3/7/2023 9:50 PM] shwanzy.
there is two micro sd slots, one internal, one accessible from the outside


[3/7/2023 9:50 PM] szybet
ok cool


[3/7/2023 9:50 PM] szybet
inkbox doesnt have support for the external one


[3/7/2023 9:51 PM] shwanzy.
guessed so


[3/7/2023 9:51 PM] szybet
well you can add it always


[3/7/2023 9:51 PM] shwanzy.
just took out the original card and use an 16gb card instead, honestly more space than I could ever fill with books


[3/7/2023 9:51 PM] shwanzy.
I think you are overestimating what I can do 😄


[3/7/2023 9:52 PM] shwanzy.
I'm already totally lost with the button thing... and I just realized this has a home button, too!

i learned c++ / qt only beause of this project


[3/7/2023 9:54 PM] shwanzy.
hey gets me motivated to really get into it! all I can do is a hello world.


[3/7/2023 9:54 PM] szybet
its not that hard too


[3/7/2023 9:55 PM] shwanzy.
so how did you do it? just wanted to change something in inkbox and then started with a c++ beginner tutorial or something?


[3/7/2023 9:57 PM] szybet
i had some background in programming in general - tables, loops, references etc. I just started writing an app for inkbox i just wanted and with fails and many errors i got there

yeeah but I actually have to sit my ass down one day and just learn c++. I "learned" it multiple times in school and university and it always got to the point I could write a hello world but not any further. And looking at any actual real life source code I still don't understand anything.


[3/7/2023 10:05 PM] szybet
first write your own program then try to understand someone others


[3/7/2023 10:09 PM] shwanzy.
yes probably best, thanks for the tips!


[3/7/2023 10:11 PM] szybet
It would be cool if joined the project - here are only me and @tux-linux really


[3/7/2023 10:15 PM] shwanzy.
it would be an honor! not sure if I can actually be helpful though.


[3/7/2023 10:16 PM] shwanzy.
will try out anything you guys throw at me for sure! And probably get a tolino page 2 to test that one too. We'll see if I'll be able to contribute anything codewise soon, I doubt it tbh...

my guess: you are all just way smarter than you think and think anyone can just help with the code!


[3/7/2023 10:25 PM] shwanzy.
this project rocks, literally the only open source os for ereaders. And I can install it on some old ass device that has not seen an official os update since five years.


[3/7/2023 10:26 PM] szybet
in my opinion almost everyone could learn to code: But in this case im talking about people who wanted to port and just left, see #porting kobo clara thread


[3/7/2023 10:26 PM] szybet
for sure 10 people already, and its just one device


[3/7/2023 10:28 PM] szybet
well dont be so in rush - installing inkbox on a random device could damage the device ( the kernel is configured for specific devices, and it sets specific voltages for chips, like wifi ) but cool that you got it running, tolinos are safe, but no other brand


[3/7/2023 10:31 PM] shwanzy.
yes i'm aware, just did it because I knew the hardware was identical to the kobo glo... plus internal storage is a microsd 😄 nothing to lose here, just switch and go!

soldered eemmc storages are another problem

[3/12/2023 1:10 AM] aryetis
Adding Anki and/or using jisho's API to get some basic dictionary functionalities, flashcards and qcm from a reliable source was my next milestone (for Obenkyobo).


[3/12/2023 1:10 AM] shwanzy.
i have a question: i'm working on the wiki and think about adding a small part about making the usb storage (the onboard file) larger than 500mb. Do you think it should be recommended to make it as big as the partition allows, minus 2,5gb (that's roughly the size the partition minus the onboard file is on default 4gb card)?


[3/12/2023 1:13 AM] szybet
i think anki / your app should be separate anyway, so okay cool


[3/12/2023 1:15 AM] aryetis
For sure Obenkyobo would still specialise in japanese so it's good to have a more general anki app.


[3/12/2023 1:16 AM] szybet
i dont understand but:
1. After fliashing, increase the p4 to the max size in gparted let's say
2. Increase the size of the onboard file to as much as possible, i dont know about how much should be left of it @tux-linux should answer ( the only thing that increases size on p4 is update.isa right? but it's getting a redesign soo? )


[3/12/2023 1:17 AM] szybet
yea, and mine is also pretty usable and good*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* so you would reinvent the wheel

[3/12/2023 1:33 AM] shwanzy.
all good!


[3/12/2023 1:37 AM] shwanzy.
i think a small issue with how info is presented to users is that it's all spread over website, wiki and github. maybe best to keep only code in github, all guides and infos and stuff in the wiki, and a nice web page for representation only. Then just link everything accordingly. But not todays anways, sleep well everyone! 👋


[3/12/2023 11:21 AM] szybet
the reason for me is that the wiki editor is crappy, i prefer markdown. But if you want, you can with pandoc convert those markdown notes into wikimedia and paste them & put there a link to the oryginal to github & under a special directory or smth.


[3/12/2023 11:21 AM] szybet
i also dont like wikimedia because there is no easy way to back it up for me. for git repo? i simply clone it


[3/12/2023 11:23 AM] szybet
also @shwanzy what is a reasonable shipping cost from germany to poland? maybe you know


[3/12/2023 11:27 AM] shwanzy.
maybe we can create a "wiki repo" or something then? Don't care about using wiki tech, just about things being sorted and not redundant. Like one place for code, one place for documentation, how tos etc, one place (website) for representation. Btw forget what I posted yesterday formatting was so shitty I'm already working on it 😅


[3/12/2023 11:28 AM] szybet
well you could make a script that downloads all those guides from github to one place, for sure


[3/12/2023 11:28 AM] szybet
and just make a bot that updates it once a week or smth


[3/12/2023 11:30 AM] shwanzy.
when I stumbled upon inkbox it was hard to wrap my head around how to even begin with installing. Because there is important info spread over wiki, website and github. Took a while to find out all the details: Like that I have to remove the internal sd, that I have to update to 1.6 first and then to latest, how to increase usb storage and so on. It's all there somewhere, just some parts here some parts there, and you are never quite sure you got everything right as a noob.


[3/12/2023 11:30 AM] szybet
yea, a definitive guide should be added


[3/12/2023 11:31 AM] shwanzy.
yeah ill see if I can improve the page as it is on wiki. just important to have the content for now, and we can format like we want later!

i think the section i added about expanding usb storage still sucks idk a better way.


[3/12/2023 1:33 PM] szybet
Very cool


[3/12/2023 1:33 PM] szybet
but maybe make the update section more uniwersal, not about specific versions


[3/12/2023 1:33 PM] szybet
it's good


[3/12/2023 1:44 PM] shwanzy.
about about section: idk if I got it right. All devices got release images version 1.6 or higher, only a few still have 1.5.


[3/12/2023 1:44 PM] shwanzy.
if you got 1.6 you can update straight to latest release 1.9


[3/12/2023 1:45 PM] shwanzy.
if you got 1.5 you have to update to 1.6 and then to latest release.

if i understood it correctly

https://pastebin.com/raw/8qVY6eCs better? should I save it? I feel like somebody should test the expand storage thing first. And I also removed the info on nickel add on from there because it is quite different to inkbox as os, and unmaintained

and probably there is a way better way to increase usb storage anyways

**Reason**
In June 2021 I had forgotten to make the update script copy the rootfs signature in the update because it was only recently added, not at the same time that rootfs was converted to a squashfs. So I had to fix the mess by providing a 'staging' kernel bind-mounting a working update script then changing that kernel for the normal one and update the rootfs to a version that would update the update script itself.

🥴 

[3/16/2023 9:20 AM] shwanzy.
Haven't even done enough that you could call it giving up 😅


[3/16/2023 9:22 AM] shwanzy.
should I really translate the wiki to german? will change a lot and most trying to install should be fine with english. I'll do it though if wanted. Would much more like to translate inkbox ui because people use that every day!


[3/16/2023 9:30 AM] shwanzy.
i would like to get this to work the most! But what is easy for you is not for me for sure. Might have to learn actual cpp before continuing... anyways can you explain a little further how a button would be implemented using power daemon? If I can not get it to work can I maybe send you event codes or whatever you need so you can make the buttons work without having the device?


[3/16/2023 9:50 AM] szybet
Well its your decission


[3/16/2023 9:51 AM] szybet
Well first you would need to root inkbox and then update everything manually, then give me logs from ipd


[3/16/2023 9:51 AM] szybet
Before describing the process, you need to tell me how many button there are and what shpuld they do


[3/16/2023 10:10 AM] shwanzy.
A: power slider
B: screen backlight
C: home button

[3/16/2023 10:11 AM] shwanzy.
A works, B should toggle backlight on and off, C should return to home screen


[3/16/2023 10:13 AM] szybet
B is easy to do, C not


[3/16/2023 11:13 AM] szybet
For b:
1. Add a system wide way to detect thats its a tolino, but still let the device think its the kobo model for compability
2. ( If the button is the same dev device as A ) detect it, if the kobo model and tolino bool match then run a function toggling the backlight.

For C:
i would do this this way: redesign the communication between apps and ipd to unix sockets, then send a message through this socket that reader should receive and save progress, after 2s kill all apps ( user apps, inkbox, xorg ) and restart inkbox-bin and at last make inkbox start faster ( maybe multi threading the start functions )

hi. what's the best supported device for running inkbox on?


[5/13/2023 6:45 PM] futuresffpcer
what kind of battery life should i expect running inkbox on it, and using it just for reading?


[5/13/2023 6:47 PM] szybet
Apart from the nia, i think that the battery life is similar ot better


[5/13/2023 6:48 PM] szybet
Maybe glo hd, but the nia is also pretty good


[5/13/2023 6:49 PM] futuresffpcer
i was thinking nia because it's the newest, but its screen is only 212 ppi (compared to the glo hd's 300)


[5/13/2023 6:51 PM] futuresffpcer
between the nia and the glo hd, which would you choose?


[5/13/2023 6:57 PM] futuresffpcer
other than being older, on paper the glo hd looks like the better device


[5/13/2023 7:21 PM] szybet
compare eink speed ( diffrent technologies ) and then decide

Hello, I'm trying to update Inkbox from 1.5 to 1.9 but when it plug it in, it keeps restarting and doesn't show in my drives.. Any ideas?


[6/15/2023 1:48 PM] szybet
you know you need to go to 1.6 first


[6/15/2023 1:49 PM] Deleted User
Noted. Anyway,

I didn't actually manage to copy it because it restarts when I plug it in..

Or other way, any idea how to flash 1.9 directly, for mini?

it will be released in a few days


[6/15/2023 1:52 PM] Deleted User
Oh :o


[6/15/2023 1:52 PM] szybet
if there is no 1.9 image, you need to make it yourself

I certainly hope I will be able to flash the Inkbox 2.0 directly once it arrives...  Since I cannot connect to pc for some reason.


[6/15/2023 2:10 PM] szybet
you will be able


[6/15/2023 2:14 PM] Deleted User
By the way, are there any alternative ways to load books in the system? It's kinda useless without them..


[6/15/2023 2:14 PM] szybet
with a rooted system you can via ssh - and soon we will have syncthing user app

im about to root my ereader after flashing inkbox to it and im seeing an `onboard storage size` dialogue, the default being 64 MiB, im not sure what this is for, is it the amount of free space in the root partition?


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
the space available for books


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
you can for example set it low & have more space with tinkering on the gui rootfs


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] spagettio
ah ok, ill give it the maximum 1024 MiB then


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] spagettio
since i have some large books


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] spagettio
cheers


[6/27/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
you can change it later with a fev commands


[6/27/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
to be even larger


[6/27/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[6/27/2023 1:07 PM] spagettio
ah nice, i assume its just resizing a certain partition?


[6/27/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
yep, + 2 commands


[6/27/2023 1:07 PM] spagettio
easy \:)


[6/27/2023 1:09 PM] szybet
addiotional note: this takes very long, after it the screen will go black and it will be turned off


[6/27/2023 1:09 PM] szybet
wait 3 minutes after the screen goes black, then boot it up


[6/27/2023 1:09 PM] spagettio
i enabled the system logs so i see it doing stuff


[6/27/2023 1:10 PM] szybet
cool

the re is a little bar in the middle shuffling around doin stuff


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] spagettio
im excited to be able to have my ereader running linux with root


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] szybet
to be fair kobo doesnt lock down their ereaders


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] spagettio
alongside reading books i think itll be cool to use it as a screen for my raspberry pi via VNC


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] szybet
you can have root there


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] szybet
the vnc is.. not great for now


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] spagettio
im sure i probbaly could but also a foss interface is nice


[6/27/2023 1:12 PM] szybet
but usable


[6/27/2023 1:13 PM] spagettio
id expect it not to be great on a slow device like that


[6/27/2023 1:13 PM] szybet
we plan to implement a better one, but this will take time, its the last item in the TODO


[6/27/2023 1:13 PM] spagettio
but i think i could probably make a program with large buttons as a little dashboard to run on the pi which could probably work ok on an e-ink screen


[6/27/2023 1:14 PM] spagettio
yeah thats fair, get the important stuff done before the fun things 😛


[6/27/2023 1:14 PM] szybet
what dashboard do you want?


[6/27/2023 1:14 PM] spagettio
i was meaning for my pi, stuff to start servers and whatnot


[6/27/2023 1:14 PM] szybet
why you dont do that from the kobo


[6/27/2023 1:15 PM] szybet
natively


[6/27/2023 1:15 PM] spagettio
my pi has no screen, so i was thinking it would be cool to be able to use vnc and use the kobo as a little "screen"


[6/27/2023 1:15 PM] spagettio
if nothing else just as a little experiment


[6/27/2023 1:15 PM] szybet
I understand, but if you plan a dashboard, then the pi is not needed


[6/27/2023 1:16 PM] spagettio
i mean that the dashboard is for the pi


[6/27/2023 1:16 PM] spagettio
if that makes sense


[6/27/2023 1:17 PM] spagettio
pi with dashboard to turn on and off stuff like a nextcloud server > uses vnc to display on the kobo = controling pi from my ereader


[6/27/2023 1:17 PM] szybet
so if you want to control your pi from the ereader, than the vnc connection is not needed


[6/27/2023 1:17 PM] szybet
but can be done if you want it be very simple


[6/27/2023 1:18 PM] szybet
just saying


[6/27/2023 1:18 PM] spagettio
yeah i understand it wouldnt be the ideal way to do it


[6/27/2023 2:01 PM] tux_linux
It's great when you provide a matching resolution. Your raspberry Pi will have to issue output to 758x1024 video if it's a Glo


[6/27/2023 2:01 PM] szybet

[7/8/2023 9:19 PM] rs_matr1x
so I got Inkbox 2.0 running on my original model Kobo Glo, one thing I notice is that project gutenberg integration is very minimal.  A search button or link to top 100 books would be much more useful than "latest books" which is almost just mocking you with its lack of anything interesting.  also selecting timezone in settings, the scroll bar doesnt do anything you just have to sort of highlight and hope you find the right time zone.  perhaps an auto-detect region by network option would be more user intuitive.  thats how a debian install seems to do it.  other than being a little slow  in some places (understandable considering how old the hardware is) its working well.


[7/8/2023 9:25 PM] szybet
we know about settings, we plan to change it


[7/8/2023 9:25 PM] szybet
where is it slow?

as for project gutenberg: Yes, we know that too. We lack developers, there are only 2 of us with little to no support


[7/8/2023 9:26 PM] szybet
we are welcome to new contributors or for donations to motivate


[7/8/2023 9:26 PM] szybet
anyways, thanks for the feedback, its motivating when someone gives it


[7/8/2023 9:30 PM] rs_matr1x
I guess you feel the slowness during keyboard presses mostly.  noticable delay.


[7/8/2023 9:30 PM] rs_matr1x
press the letter A, count to 3, oh there it is


[7/8/2023 9:31 PM] rs_matr1x
not that the input on the original kobo OS was particularly responsive either


[7/8/2023 9:32 PM] szybet
yes, its bad, we know it


[7/8/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
try sanki & todo app & terminal app


[7/8/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
its better there already


[7/8/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
still - we lack time to implement it everywhere


[7/8/2023 9:35 PM] rs_matr1x
i see good to know


[7/8/2023 9:35 PM] szybet
we need at least a few developers more to dont let this project die


[7/8/2023 9:36 PM] szybet
the creator doesnt have time because of school, i soon won't have much too


[7/8/2023 9:37 PM] rs_matr1x
I like the idea though not sure what would attract devs.


[7/8/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
dont you think that your ereader could od so much more?


[7/8/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
not only reading


[7/8/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
eink devices with android are either crappy or too expensive


[7/8/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
when kobos can do so much more


[7/8/2023 9:39 PM] szybet
note taking, music, rss, messaging, learning...


[7/8/2023 9:39 PM] szybet
at least thats mine motivation


[7/8/2023 9:41 PM] kuratius
if you can make it so that anyone can port or make their own app in less than 5 min for  inkbox that'd probably be amazing too, but probably not compatible with the security policy you guys use


[7/8/2023 9:41 PM] kuratius
is the rooting via menu implemented?


[7/8/2023 9:41 PM] szybet
stop complaining about the security...............................


[7/8/2023 9:41 PM] szybet
yes!


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] kuratius
ah wasnt sure if I misrembered


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] szybet
im doing that with apps? rss guard took 3h to port


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] szybet
matrix client already works, will be ready today / tommorow


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] rs_matr1x
oh thats neat


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] kuratius
does the wiki have that info yet?


[7/8/2023 9:42 PM] szybet
porting will never be easy - you need both hardware and software knowledge


[7/8/2023 9:43 PM] szybet
maybe, but i tell that everyone that wants


[7/8/2023 9:43 PM] szybet
tux-linux didnt said you that for some reason & I didn't knew


[7/8/2023 9:44 PM] szybet
there was a student with little linux knowledge that had build inkbox in a few hours with tux-linux help, from scratch


[7/8/2023 9:45 PM] szybet
there is lack in interest, not like with plato - the author doesnt like contributors


[7/9/2023 2:30 PM] tux_linux
because you have the private key
i need to document developer mode in wiki


[7/9/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
still


[7/9/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
imgtool now automates this


[7/9/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
what are we even talking about


[7/9/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
kuratius was the only person that refused to elaborate and only because imtool, there was no one more


[7/9/2023 2:32 PM] tux_linux
developer mode bypasses sig verification


[7/9/2023 2:32 PM] tux_linux
not on rootfs itself but on pretty much everything else


[7/9/2023 2:32 PM] tux_linux
so devs can run user apps on their rooted device without having to create a full image for it


[7/9/2023 2:33 PM] kuratius
Refused to elaborate what?


[7/9/2023 2:33 PM] szybet

Hi. Will inkbox run on my cheap kobo clara 2e?


[7/9/2023 5:49 PM] szybet
Hello, no, no one ported it yet. you can do it


[7/9/2023 5:50 PM] kuratius
Do you have a serial adapter or a raspberry pi?


[7/9/2023 5:50 PM] henrikbruhn.
OK, i guess i will have to read about it in the wiki?


[7/9/2023 5:51 PM] szybet
look at the #porting threads


[7/9/2023 5:51 PM] szybet
how its done


[7/9/2023 5:51 PM] kuratius
Drivers and hardware communication


[7/9/2023 5:52 PM] kuratius
Also kernel versions


[7/9/2023 5:52 PM] szybet
every device is diffrent, has a diffrent kernel and devices. some will have the button at /dev/event0 and some atg event3 for example


[7/9/2023 5:52 PM] henrikbruhn.
thank you, never tried porting before 🙂


[7/9/2023 5:54 PM] kuratius
Also the linux kobos run by default is apparently made in a non standard way, so some things don't run by default even when they ought to


[7/9/2023 5:54 PM] kuratius
Andi complained about this a few times iirc


[7/9/2023 5:55 PM] henrikbruhn.
is the web browser in inkbox better than the stock browser, which is very limited?


[7/9/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
im not confident enought to say that its better. it is what it is.

What I take away from this is that the people making the os for kobos only have the bare minimum if competence necessary to get a working device and that they will probably have to stop maintaining older devices because they can't keep straight what device requires what dirty hacks

would using a faster sd card actually matter? or is the main bottleneck in e-readers the processor/ram?


[7/14/2023 12:28 AM] kuratius
sd card probably matters for boot time and maybe loading large pdfs


[7/14/2023 12:28 AM] kuratius
Everything else should ideally  get cached


[7/14/2023 12:28 AM] redauburn

If you swap a lot between apps that could be affected too

[8/26/2023 11:00 PM] szybet
disable xorg


[8/26/2023 11:02 PM] tux_linux
its already pretty good


[8/26/2023 11:03 PM] szybet
also depends on your use cases


[8/26/2023 11:03 PM] szybet
tldr it can be worse than on the original firmware for various reasons, but not on a lot

you had wifi turned on this whole time?


[8/26/2023 11:14 PM] weeda2192
Looks like it. Is it on by default?


[8/26/2023 11:14 PM] szybet
nope, you need to turn it on and off manually


[8/26/2023 11:14 PM] tux_linux
no

wifi will have a massive impact on battery life

replaying in some way as a user of Inkbox per the announcment. the new version has been nice on my Kobo Touch (N905C). use to crash a lot. still slow on larger files but can't complain too much given the hardware vintage. Love that I can run a FOSS ereader with this project. You're doing God's work here.


[8/31/2023 5:33 PM] szybet
well we need complains too to improve things

the kobo touch is the slowest device to my knowledge - speed on larger files will be fixed. If you described how to reproduce those crashes and create a github issue it would be helpfull

thanks for the feedback

hi there! this project looks amazing, although I haven't gotten it to work yet. I wrote the inkbox 2.0 N236 image to the SD card for two N236 units I picked up cheap on ebay (my daily carry is clara hd), but neither one will boot from the sd card. The screen blanked, and then it just flashes the light without going any further. What should I do?


[9/3/2023 3:24 AM] nebajoth_97745
it is a solid white light for about 10 seconds, then the screen flashes and the light starts blinking

Use balena etcher


[9/3/2023 7:32 AM] nebajoth
Ok thanks! I'll do that


[9/3/2023 8:02 AM] nebajoth
That fixed it! And it flashed way faster than the command line xz piped to dd


[9/3/2023 8:03 AM] nebajoth
Today I learned etcher can take a compressed image file as input


[9/3/2023 8:53 AM] szybet
Balena rechecks if everything worked


[9/3/2023 8:53 AM] szybet
In your example the kernel booted and died, only managed to flash the screen


[9/3/2023 7:55 PM] nebajoth
Sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm not sure how to transfer epub files onto the device. I plug it in via USB to my laptop, and it prompts me to allow the USB connection and then changes the sscreen to "USB connected", but there is no device detected by the PC (running nixos), nothing in dmesg, no file system showing up. I looked at issues and the wiki, but I don't know if I'm just missing something simple.


[9/3/2023 7:58 PM] nebajoth
I bet it was a cable issue


[9/3/2023 7:58 PM] nebajoth
brb lol


[9/3/2023 8:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it works now or not


[9/3/2023 8:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
look up if anything shows up in dmesg related to this, on host and on inkbox os


[9/3/2023 8:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what device do you have once more? kobo touch?


[9/3/2023 8:04 PM] nebajoth
aura se


[9/3/2023 8:04 PM] nebajoth
nothing in dmesg on laptop


[9/3/2023 8:04 PM] nebajoth
haven't gotten shell on the device yet, guess I'll do that next


[9/3/2023 8:04 PM] nebajoth
just tried a third usb cable and none of them work


[9/3/2023 8:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
usb is tricky, there are issues with it


[9/3/2023 8:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you need to debug it


[9/3/2023 8:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
or just upload via scp / syncthing if you dont care


[9/3/2023 8:13 PM] nebajoth
scp is easy enough, but I'd also like to help get it working better


[9/3/2023 8:14 PM] nebajoth
and I do already have syncthing that syncs to my clara hd


[9/3/2023 8:15 PM] nebajoth
so probably that'll be the way I move books longterm anyway


[9/3/2023 8:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
well then with scp upload them to /data/onboard then remove the files in .database directory which is in there, open files dialog library will generate and thats it


[9/3/2023 8:17 PM] nebajoth
is it running an sshd by default?


[9/3/2023 8:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you need to root the device


[9/3/2023 8:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
did i explained it already?


[9/3/2023 11:12 PM] nebajoth
no, but if there's documentation for that, I can undertake it. plenty of experience with this kind of thing


[9/3/2023 11:13 PM] nebajoth
is it just a question of flashing the image that allows running unsigned packages?


[9/3/2023 11:13 PM] nebajoth
I can also volunteer to document some of these things if they are currently undocumented

Wifi is just linux kernel ( modules config compiling and stuff ) and then shell scripts that use typical linux commands

And the gui wraps arround them, so easy to debug

Usb mass storage works in a similar way, its just more complicated because of filesystems

Pretty interesting project, I am glad to help out. I have a Clara HD I love that I would love to see inkbox on eventually. I bought the aura se units essentially to test inkbox, but the hardware is noticeably slower (even on root Kobo firmware) and I ache for the speed of the newer hardware, but with the ability to be Real Linux.


[9/4/2023 12:24 AM] tux_linux
It runs on clara HD
But you probably would find it even slower there


[9/4/2023 3:12 AM] nebajoth
Isn't the Clara hd hardware newer?


[9/4/2023 3:13 AM] tux_linux
yes, but because of framebuffer issues, the display is actually slower than most older devices with inkbox os


[9/4/2023 3:13 AM] nebajoth
Yikes


[9/4/2023 3:13 AM] tux_linux
it is usable, but slower in average


[9/4/2023 3:13 AM] tux_linux
it has to wait for each update to finish completely before doing a new one


[9/4/2023 3:13 AM] nebajoth
Can the framebuffer issues eventually be addressed?

[9/7/2023 3:20 PM] axe05914
Hello.  New to InkBox here.  Installed it on a Kobo Mini last night.  The unit is so slow with frequent freezes that require hard reboot to fix.  Any suggestions on how to sort this out?  Or is this device just too small and slow to expect more?


[9/7/2023 3:20 PM] tux_linux
Probably the latter
It's twelve years old


[9/7/2023 3:21 PM] tux_linux
What do you mean by 'frequent freezes'


[9/7/2023 3:24 PM] axe05914
Lets say opening the browser ... takes up to 2 mins and then there does not seem to be any way to close it.  Switching from the reading page to the home page in the reader takes about a minute.


[9/7/2023 3:26 PM] axe05914
I'm used to a Kindle moded with KO Reader and Alpine, so I know these devices are being stretched to the limit, but this is unusable for me.

[9/7/2023 8:54 PM] nebajoth
I don't mind the loading time for the os, but the loading time opening an epub file and displaying it could use at least some sort of acknowledgement that something is happening. As it stands, the lack of feedback about whether a touchscreen press has even been registered plus the fact that it takes 20ish seconds for the screen to even change to the epub reader means I've mashed it repeatedly every time because I don't think it's working. It's not so much lag I guess

I handed my Inkbox Kobo Nia to a 3 year old today.

After opening it, it was on the last page I was reading, but the page turn buttons wouldn't work.  

I didn't know why, so I suggested he hold down the power button.  

He did that while running around the room.  It was in diagnostics mode.  Then I had to chase him to get it back.

Somehow he got it to the reset screen before I got it back.  I thought, why not soft reset it?  It can't read a PDF I put on there, the cover of a book I removed is still on there, and it won't open the epub that I had converted from a PDF of a Bible.  

So I soft reset it, and then in the start up choose not to enable kobox this time, until you tell me it works better.

I thought you might want to know about the friction for dev purposes.

Are there any tricks to adding books so they work well?


[10/10/2023 7:41 AM] [matrix] Szybet

Hi,
I see that Kobo Libra H2O (N873) was supported, so I'd like to do that.
When I opened the back of my e-reader, I didn't see an SD card. How do I install the new OS ?


[10/21/2023 7:16 PM] szybet
hi
this model has an eemc with is harder to install it and easier to brick the device forever, additionally the developers dont have time explaining the install process so you would need to figure it out yourself

Hi guys I have an old kobo, I'm trying to figure if I can install Inkos. I don't remember exactly the model the serial number starts with N905J so it's a N905, on the website I see two versions B and C, do you know how to check which one is mine? Also the sd is less then 4gb but I can swap it with another 32gb one


[10/30/2023 1:44 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Somewhere on the device it should be written down

how does it work then? I cannot paste more then 500mb files inside

it's a 32gb sd card


[10/30/2023 2:33 PM] tux_linux
its a storage restriction of inkbox images

Hello,
is InkBox available as a standalone application?
I am asking because it appears that postmarketOS now runs on the PineNote, and InkBox looks like it could be the perfect software to run on the PineNote.


[11/25/2023 2:28 PM] szybet
nope


[11/25/2023 2:28 PM] szybet
a hard nope.


[11/25/2023 2:28 PM] szybet
if it runs postmarket os, it can run inkbox because inkbox uses old alpine as half of its base


[11/25/2023 2:32 PM] szybet
we tried to contact pine to help us port inkbox to it, noone was interested

apart from that, current inkbox is not worth it - the reader is bad - for now its more an application launcher ( we have a new reader written in 60% but we dont have time to finish it )


[11/25/2023 2:35 PM] [matrix] Julian Groß
Yeah, my experiences with Pine aren't amazing either. From what I can tell they won't help with anything, other than providing cheap devices (though the PineNote is pretty expensive of course).
Though I am more of a customer than a developer.


[11/25/2023 2:38 PM] [matrix] Julian Groß
Sounds like I would be better off running Xournal++ on postmarketOS then, or just getting something completely proprietary.


[11/25/2023 2:44 PM] kuratius
you could look into running koreader or plato, though you probably wont be 100 % happy with either of them


[11/25/2023 2:44 PM] kuratius
koreader is kind of hard to run on alpine without a lot of work and plato doesnt support rendering epubs correctly

[12/17/2023 3:11 PM] trololol_20401
does anyone know how well that works relative to inkbox? its my understanding inkbox only supports older devices as of now

is there any software for postmarketos that could be used to actually read ebooks comfortably?

pmOS from what I have I seen is better than inkbox on the technical side, worse on the UI side

technical side only because it's a newer kernel but yes

I've suggested making inkbox an OS-agnostic UI program before

but it was apparently too complicated or not a high priority


[12/17/2023 3:14 PM] trololol_20401
figure out as in just compile it or figure it out as in it doesnt want to compile on alpine for some reason?


[12/17/2023 3:14 PM] kuratius
their build system is weird and I couldnt get the right dependencies without reading all the code to figure out how it fits together and I didnt have time for that

couldnt even build the emulator because the documentation is just bad


[12/17/2023 3:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i use syncthing


[12/17/2023 3:15 PM] kuratius
doesnt list required packages etc


[12/17/2023 3:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the browser is barely working, no downloading books for sure

[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i already said


[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the emulator is bad


[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] Szybet
as for qemu


[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it work so shitty even i gived up on it


[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] kuratius
am talking about plato


[12/17/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the same thing then ;p


[12/17/2023 3:17 PM] trololol_20401

[12/17/2023 3:18 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes, barely working and lagging


[12/17/2023 3:18 PM] [matrix] Szybet
dont expect much from 255 mb of ram


[12/17/2023 3:18 PM] kuratius
clara is 512 MB I think


[12/17/2023 3:18 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the textedit browser in rss guard works good for bare html files websites


[12/17/2023 3:20 PM] trololol_20401
i suppose sideloading isnt too bad


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] trololol_20401
is inkbox on like a wayyyyy old kernel or just behind?


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] kuratius
wayy old


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] kuratius
2.6


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
depends on the device


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
mine is 4.15


[12/17/2023 3:21 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
use syncthing, thats it


[12/17/2023 3:23 PM] trololol_20401
oh?


[12/17/2023 3:23 PM] trololol_20401

kobo nia, a modified one


[12/17/2023 3:23 PM] kuratius
What is the version of the chroot enviroment?


[12/17/2023 3:23 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
old device has a old kernel, newer device has a never kernel

what do you guys expect?


[12/17/2023 3:24 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
alpine 3.10 and Qt 5.12.1? something like that


[12/17/2023 3:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
stop complaining about the versions, they doesnt matter.


[12/17/2023 3:27 PM] trololol_20401
modified? how so, if you dont mind me asking?

[12/17/2023 3:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
+ it has a external sd card slot now and exposed serial pins


[12/17/2023 3:31 PM] trololol_20401
hmmm


[12/17/2023 3:32 PM] trololol_20401
has anyone actually successfully compiled plato on postmarketos?


[12/17/2023 3:32 PM] trololol_20401
that seems to be the best option to me


[12/17/2023 3:32 PM] trololol_20401
if not then i think ill go with your thing szybet


[12/17/2023 3:32 PM] trololol_20401
looks pretty cool


[12/17/2023 3:33 PM] [matrix] Szybet
thing? inkbox? or the nia back attachment?


[12/17/2023 3:33 PM] kuratius
plato doesnt render epubs correctly, idk if that will bother you


[12/17/2023 3:33 PM] trololol_20401
inkbox with your audio mod, since it seems cool


[12/17/2023 3:34 PM] trololol_20401
incorrectly how? and like


[12/17/2023 3:34 PM] trololol_20401
why


[12/17/2023 3:34 PM] trololol_20401
it seems pretty actively maintained


[12/17/2023 3:34 PM] kuratius
idk, ask them what hack they used to get epubs to work
ruby syntax for example is ignored


[12/17/2023 3:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet

the PCB has a lot of errors and requires expert soldering skills to make it work, it would require a remake

[12/17/2023 3:43 PM] trololol_20401
is inkbox and that one version of postmarketos the only alternative software that has been found to work on kobos?


[12/17/2023 3:43 PM] trololol_20401
i wonder how much more difficult it would be to get linux working on a kobo and  then just try to compile plato, as kuratius said


[12/17/2023 3:44 PM] kuratius
pmOS is linux


[12/17/2023 3:44 PM] trololol_20401
this is assuming more kobos COULD run some type of linux as opposed to pmOS specifically


[12/17/2023 3:44 PM] trololol_20401
but i guess thats not necessarily true


[12/17/2023 3:44 PM] trololol_20401
pmOS as of now seems to only work on the kobo clara hd but quite well on that


[12/17/2023 3:45 PM] trololol_20401
including wifi and everything


[12/17/2023 3:45 PM] trololol_20401
dude in that video even used firefox which is crazy


[12/17/2023 3:45 PM] kuratius
I'm pretty sure they mostly can, you just need to hook up some things like the user interface correctly


[12/17/2023 3:45 PM] trololol_20401
wdym?


[12/17/2023 3:46 PM] trololol_20401
honestly the reason im asking is because the clara hd is a bit small


[12/17/2023 3:46 PM] kuratius
once you got booting and a working kernel everything else is just getting ui to work


[12/17/2023 3:47 PM] kuratius
and installing software/dependencies correctly


[12/17/2023 3:48 PM] trololol_20401
huh


[12/17/2023 3:48 PM] trololol_20401
i would assume the hard part is the actual eink display working


[12/17/2023 3:49 PM] kuratius
on pmOS it's handled by standard linux interfaces, so if you set environment variables any application can talk to the display


[12/17/2023 3:50 PM] kuratius
we had some driver issues initially on the nia where it was giving the wrong color range for the device, but that got fixed


[12/17/2023 3:51 PM] kuratius
e.g.  DISPLAY=:0 ./your_program worked for the stuff I compiled for the most part


[12/17/2023 3:51 PM] kuratius
ran some touchscreen calibrator for example


[12/17/2023 3:53 PM] kuratius
only issue for me with pmOS was that xfce is basically too heavy for the nia to reasonably use


[12/17/2023 3:53 PM] kuratius
ram limitation


[12/17/2023 3:53 PM] kuratius
you end up with like 10 MB left for user programs, 60 MB if you dont count cache


[12/17/2023 3:54 PM] trololol_20401
yeah thats rough but xfce isnt exactly THE lightest option


[12/17/2023 3:54 PM] trololol_20401
unrelated but is nickleboot just a firmware mod?


[12/17/2023 3:54 PM] trololol_20401
nicklemenu excuse me


[12/17/2023 3:55 PM] kuratius
iirc it just adds some extra options to the default nickel interface


[12/17/2023 3:55 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Nickelboot no
Nickelmenu yes


[12/17/2023 3:55 PM] trololol_20401
and nickleboot is?


[12/17/2023 4:05 PM] szybet
getting some actual shit to work and run like wifi, power management, making it work on many devices, xorg kinda is hard, and then inkbox os exists and does that


[12/17/2023 4:07 PM] trololol_20401
yeah that makes sense


[12/17/2023 4:07 PM] trololol_20401
also is kobo violating the GPL license or are the proprietary parts of it made by them?


[12/17/2023 4:07 PM] trololol_20401
since as i understand kobo DOES run linux by default


[12/17/2023 4:07 PM] trololol_20401
so it is it just userland thats proprietary?


[12/17/2023 4:08 PM] trololol_20401
CAN you find the kernel they use somewhere?


[12/17/2023 4:08 PM] trololol_20401
sorry, stupid questions but i honestly have no clue


[12/17/2023 4:08 PM] trololol_20401
im behind on the e-reader meta


[12/17/2023 4:09 PM] szybet
the ui part, yes


[12/17/2023 4:09 PM] szybet
the kernel part, no - we use it thats why we run on such many devices


[12/17/2023 4:10 PM] szybet
github kobo labs


[12/17/2023 4:10 PM] trololol_20401
so nickel is the menu? and thats the proprietary part?


[12/17/2023 4:10 PM] trololol_20401
and its also what inkbox replaces?


[12/17/2023 4:11 PM] [matrix] Szybet
inkbox replaces the whole OS, everything


[12/17/2023 4:11 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nickel is the stock OS, and the UI in it


[12/17/2023 4:11 PM] trololol_20401
but why, if the kernel is free software?


[12/17/2023 4:12 PM] [matrix] Szybet
to modify the kernel to allow os to boot a real os


[12/17/2023 4:12 PM] [matrix] Szybet
they use buildroot with is hard to work with


[12/17/2023 4:13 PM] [matrix] Szybet
we use alpine, we have apk from alpine and we can eassly use it


[12/17/2023 4:13 PM] trololol_20401
i get it


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] trololol_20401
is there anything that replaces the proprietary UI but doesnt attempt to replace the kernel, thereby working on newer devices?


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] [matrix] Szybet
koreader, plato do this


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] trololol_20401
again, im not trying to diss inkbox or anything


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] trololol_20401
are they a userland as well?


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] trololol_20401
i thought they were more like


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yep, userland


[12/17/2023 4:14 PM] trololol_20401
apps


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
they are apps


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
that replace the main UI


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you can return to that UI


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] trololol_20401
so its still there


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] trololol_20401
or do you mean return to it by reflashing it


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the problem with this is that any update from the stock os fucks up koreader and plato and more so often resets the ereader completly


[12/17/2023 4:15 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
exit button in koreader, litterally


[12/17/2023 4:16 PM] trololol_20401
so really its just running on top of the proprietary components, right?


[12/17/2023 4:16 PM] trololol_20401
as opposed to replacing them


[12/17/2023 4:16 PM] trololol_20401
i see


[12/17/2023 4:21 PM] trololol_20401
i ask because i wonder if theres any significant difference in terms of, for example, privacy, between nicklemenu and inkbox/postmarketOS


[12/17/2023 4:21 PM] trololol_20401
and it seems like there is a big difference


[12/17/2023 4:21 PM] trololol_20401
since one just leaves the proprietary elements and the other is a full replacement


[12/17/2023 5:08 PM] trololol_20401
OK ive looked at all the options


[12/17/2023 5:08 PM] trololol_20401
seems inkbox is the best choice


[12/17/2023 5:08 PM] trololol_20401
i just wonder how easy reading research papers and such will be on a 6 inch screen


[12/17/2023 5:39 PM] kuratius
not very


[12/17/2023 5:40 PM] trololol_20401
yyyyeah


[12/17/2023 5:56 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Koreader is fine


[12/17/2023 6:01 PM] trololol_20401
how so?


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Rotate the device


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] trololol_20401
ok valid


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] [matrix] Szybet
And then its fine


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] [matrix] Szybet
At leats for me


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] trololol_20401
you mean koreader on inkbox im assuming


[12/17/2023 6:02 PM] trololol_20401
actually


[12/17/2023 6:03 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Yep


[12/17/2023 6:03 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Use koreader, the main reader sucks and i dont have time to complete the new one


[12/17/2023 6:05 PM] trololol_20401
would you mind sending a photo of what it looks like picture quality wise with a random research paper with graphs and such? something like this: https://math.berkeley.edu/~kpmann/penrose%20reading.pdf or this: https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf


[12/17/2023 6:06 PM] trololol_20401
if its not too much work ofc


[12/17/2023 6:06 PM] trololol_20401
i guess the glo hd is the best choice for this


[12/17/2023 6:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Remind me later or tommorow, then i will do it for sure


[12/17/2023 6:08 PM] trololol_20401
thanks man


[12/17/2023 6:13 PM] trololol_20401
also, btw, how does koreader fix the issue with pdfs? does it retain the zoom when you rotate the device or something?


[12/17/2023 6:14 PM] kuratius
presumably you just display part of the paper at its original resolution and then in landscape mode this means you only need to scroll up/down, and you dont need to scroll left/right


[12/17/2023 6:14 PM] kuratius
zooming on an ereader isnt really fast


[12/27/2023 6:02 PM] pieterv24
Appologies if this is a really stupid question.
However I seem to be able to find nowhere how I can turn off the dark mode in inkbox.
Any help would be greatly appreciated 😅

just was wondering if there's a (easyish) way to get the libra2 to work (im realitivly newish to linux, enough to use arch but still feel like a absolute dumbass)


[1/4/2024 5:47 AM] tux_linux
it is an ntx device
it's a platform that other supported kobos are on
so it's probably not that hard
but still hard
'not that hard' by my standards


[1/4/2024 5:47 AM] master_of_derp
ah


[1/4/2024 5:49 AM] master_of_derp
i dont even use my libra anymore lol, i just carry my phone around and read chinese webnovels.


[1/4/2024 5:50 AM] master_of_derp
but if it was easy enough to do with my skill in a day, then i would be fine doing it, but seems it might be a little too much work


[1/4/2024 5:50 AM] tux_linux
probably over the course of a week at a minimum


[1/4/2024 5:51 AM] master_of_derp
yep


[1/4/2024 5:51 AM] master_of_derp
school is too soon for that


[1/4/2024 5:51 AM] master_of_derp
and too much time for something im probably not gonna touch for atleast half a year


[1/4/2024 5:52 AM] tux_linux
we are always open to device donations
if you want your model ported
no guarantees, except that we will do our best while keeping up with school


[1/4/2024 5:52 AM] tux_linux
though i understand if you want to keep it


[1/4/2024 5:53 AM] master_of_derp

[1/4/2024 5:57 AM] tux_linux
well, you seem to read fast


[1/4/2024 5:57 AM] master_of_derp
Yeah i get that


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] tux_linux
i read fast in french


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] tux_linux
i guess


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] tux_linux
im reading House of Leaves
in english
so that takes more time


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] master_of_derp
~~i hate french~~


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] tux_linux
hard to learn?


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] master_of_derp
have to learn it in school


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] master_of_derp
im horrid at it


[1/4/2024 5:58 AM] tux_linux
when you havent grown up with it i guess its harder


[1/4/2024 5:59 AM] master_of_derp
yeah


[1/4/2024 5:59 AM] master_of_derp
it is


[1/4/2024 5:59 AM] master_of_derp
your brain already establishes rules


[1/4/2024 5:59 AM] master_of_derp
and when you change those, brain hurts


[1/4/2024 5:59 AM] tux_linux
for me i think it was easier to learn english after french
it's less complicated


[1/4/2024 6:00 AM] tux_linux
though there are strange things i get confused with sometimes
like to be completely pedantic, if i have an exclamation mark in french i have to put a space before it, and not in english


[1/4/2024 6:00 AM] tux_linux
same thing with : or ;


[1/4/2024 6:00 AM] master_of_derp
# what


[1/4/2024 6:01 AM] master_of_derp
kinda dumb but ok


[1/4/2024 6:01 AM] master_of_derp
i would like to learn another language, but not french


[1/4/2024 6:01 AM] master_of_derp
i dont have french friends or anything


[1/4/2024 6:02 AM] master_of_derp
would rather learn japanese (probably alot harder but i would actually use it semi-regularly)


[1/4/2024 6:02 AM] master_of_derp
due to watching anime

well, it's the last thing you try to apply when you know the rest
nobody's going to yell at you if you don't
maybe except in written essays you submit to college


[1/4/2024 6:03 AM] master_of_derp
its like saying thats without the '


[1/4/2024 6:03 AM] tux_linux
yea
although here im only saving time ;p


[1/4/2024 6:04 AM] master_of_derp
i mean with thats its saving ALOT OF TIME even though i touch type, my muscle memory isnt trained for '


[1/4/2024 6:05 AM] tux_linux
needing to constantly switch between english and french keyboards, my muscle memory doesn't really know what to do


[1/4/2024 6:05 AM] master_of_derp
yikes


[1/4/2024 6:05 AM] tux_linux
because half the time ' is è and conversely


[1/4/2024 6:05 AM] tux_linux
english keyboard is SO much more practical for programming


[1/4/2024 6:05 AM] master_of_derp
it is


[1/4/2024 6:06 AM] master_of_derp
i know its better due to my small python knowledge and javascript (im not actually writing much code its just using kubejs so i need to understand the syntax of javascript)


[1/4/2024 6:08 AM] tux_linux
example: typing { or } with ca multilingual keyboard
right alt+7
also twisting your hand because you want to reach the keys only with the right hand


[1/4/2024 6:08 AM] tux_linux
shift+[ is better imo


[1/4/2024 6:09 AM] master_of_derp
right alt + 7? is that for numpad or on number row?


[1/4/2024 6:10 AM] tux_linux
num arrow


[1/4/2024 6:11 AM] master_of_derp
i just wasnt sure as i have a tenkeyless keyboard lol

[1/5/2024 8:42 PM] tux_linux
There is no way to do that, sorry


[1/5/2024 8:42 PM] tux_linux
You must click the gear and then the home icon


[1/5/2024 9:23 PM] lanzallamasruso
Oh, maybe something that I can modify in the code and then recompile it for myself?


[1/5/2024 9:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes you can


[1/28/2024 6:42 AM] joeblase
Hi, I recently ordered a Libra 2 and deciding if I should set it up with InkBox instead of the default OS. I have a few questions about it: What will I be missing out on? Should I expect better/worse performance and battery life with InkBox? Would getting a new micro SD card with a faster read/write speed increase performance?


[1/28/2024 11:17 AM] szybet
libra 2 is not supported.


[1/28/2024 12:40 PM] kuratius
the libra 2 currently has issues with uboot and there being different revisions, unless that gets solved soon I would stick with the default OS


[1/28/2024 12:40 PM] kuratius
you lose waterproofing on it if you do inkbox


[1/28/2024 12:40 PM] kuratius
newer micro sd might increase boot times but not much else I think


[1/28/2024 12:41 PM] kuratius
most of the time you are going to wake up from sleep so unless you need extra storage capacity I dont think it matters

[2/9/2024 10:00 AM] nonridiculousadjective
Quick question to the author, but I might be stupid, is there hope that this project would become open-source at some point?


[2/9/2024 10:38 AM] kuratius
Sir, you are in the wrong discord


[2/9/2024 10:40 AM] kuratius
(their problem is not that their project isnt open source, it's that their github project structure is somewhat hard to follow)

there are some proprietary firmware blobs from kobo but you cant fix that and they are not what's developed by this project


[2/9/2024 10:41 AM] kuratius
szybet made a compile script that downloads all the repos and dependencies and compiles them in a docker container if you want to try


[2/9/2024 10:41 AM] kuratius
I did it at one point


[2/9/2024 10:42 AM] kuratius
you may have to go back to an older commit if tux broke it again


[2/9/2024 10:47 AM] szybet
There are no propertiary blobs.


[2/9/2024 10:48 AM] szybet
Its not hard to follow, a 17 year old me figured it out when i had no experience in such things


[2/9/2024 10:54 AM] kuratius
kobo uboot isnt a blob?


[2/9/2024 10:55 AM] szybet
no, we compile it ourself


[2/9/2024 10:55 AM] szybet
the only blob that nicolas stupidly cals it is uboot device tree which can be decompiled, I did it once already - It's just calibration data...


[2/9/2024 10:56 AM] szybet
and the waveform calibration - It's just 1 and 0, you can look at it it calibrated the eink it's nothing more


[2/9/2024 10:56 AM] szybet
oh and there are sources of them in kernel sources


[2/9/2024 10:57 AM] szybet
so stop saying that or I'm gonna hurt someone next time


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] kuratius
is the kobo compiler open?


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] szybet
we dont use a propertiary compiler


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] szybet
we create them ourselfs


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] szybet
niluje created a script for that


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] szybet

[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] kuratius
wait I remember plato using the proprietary compiler


[2/9/2024 10:59 AM] kuratius
are they lazy?


[2/9/2024 11:00 AM] szybet
they do not


[2/9/2024 11:00 AM] szybet

so it's open source somewhere anyway

[2/9/2024 2:55 PM] tux_linux
i compile some kernels using linaro and/or sourcery toolchains


[2/9/2024 2:55 PM] tux_linux
like, 2010 sourcery toolchains


[2/9/2024 2:56 PM] szybet
still there is source for them, they are open source


[2/9/2024 2:56 PM] tux_linux
code sourcery is open source?


[2/9/2024 2:56 PM] tux_linux
i thought it wasnt


[2/9/2024 2:57 PM] szybet
there was 1 kindle supported, it still is just the process / installation is so complicated it was not described

apart from that

other kindles are propably locked down so we cant do anything
and we focus on other things


[2/9/2024 2:57 PM] szybet
you do it ;p


[2/9/2024 2:59 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Yeah, if it were possible I would have just upcycled the e-ink display and add a pi zero or smth like that to it.


[2/9/2024 2:59 PM] nonridiculousadjective
But I read that it is very deeply soldered in


[2/9/2024 2:59 PM] szybet
it's more complicated than that, look at #future there was a conversation about creating an open source ereader


[2/9/2024 3:00 PM] szybet
whatever, not our fault this platform is so locked down


[2/9/2024 3:00 PM] tux_linux
yea


[2/9/2024 3:00 PM] szybet
so stop saying its not fully open source because that's bullshit


[2/9/2024 3:00 PM] szybet
its like saying its not open source because the silicon inside has not been photographec layer by layer


[2/9/2024 3:01 PM] szybet
just stop making me angry thank you


[2/9/2024 3:01 PM] szybet
also stop ignoring #future ;p


[2/9/2024 3:03 PM] szybet
get a cheap used kobo / tolino and join the project if you want


[2/9/2024 3:06 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Well yeah, but I just wanted to give a kindle that I got from my sis after she upgraded a better functionality.


[2/9/2024 3:06 PM] szybet
yea not possible even if we tryied, kindles are locked down as heck


[2/9/2024 3:07 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Yeah, f*** bezos

cool


[2/9/2024 3:09 PM] szybet
I had preordered the framework 16 but because of price / problems with EU shipping I went with a tuxedo instead


[2/9/2024 3:10 PM] nonridiculousadjective
I see. It is expensive yeah, but I mean hopefully it should be cheaper in the long term. And refurbished ones on their sites are a little bit cheaper


[2/9/2024 3:11 PM] szybet
its expensive as hell, I decided that I can't afford it anyway


[2/9/2024 3:11 PM] szybet
it's I think 2100 Euro vs 1700 Euro Identical spec for the tuxedo


[2/9/2024 3:12 PM] szybet
where the tuxedo one is still expensive


[2/9/2024 3:17 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Wasn't it like 1500€-1600€m


[2/9/2024 3:18 PM] nonridiculousadjective
And 13 was like 900-1100


[2/9/2024 3:18 PM] szybet
with the dedicated GPU and reasonable specs inside


[2/9/2024 3:18 PM] szybet
the 13 is another story


[2/9/2024 3:19 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Yeah, 13 is not really a workstation but it is powerful and paired with a desktop it would work great


[2/9/2024 3:19 PM] szybet
I need a better gpu for CAD at least sometimes


[2/9/2024 3:19 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Well yeah, but you can get creative there as well, there are people reselling some of the stuff so you could get like 100€ off...


[2/9/2024 3:20 PM] szybet
still to expensive


[2/9/2024 3:20 PM] nonridiculousadjective
I guess in my case I only do basic stuff, since my 2016 gpu goes well with cad


[2/9/2024 3:21 PM] nonridiculousadjective
True, but unless ur mobile with work/school you can get desktop pc instead or stream from it too


[2/9/2024 3:21 PM] szybet
hmm, my old gtx 1050ti laptop which is from 2016 couldn't even load some of my projects anymore ( closing them was a mistake! )


[2/9/2024 3:21 PM] nonridiculousadjective
I have R7 M465 :DD


[2/9/2024 3:22 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Which is like GTX 660 or GTX 295


[2/9/2024 3:22 PM] szybet
I don't see any sense for a PC for me, I rarely need to move my laptop but I don't need the extra performance of PC anyway


[2/9/2024 3:22 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Not extra performance, but it is orders of magnitude cheaper for the same performance


[2/9/2024 3:23 PM] szybet
It's not that I couldn't afford a framework 16, I just think it's a waste of money and I value my money


[2/9/2024 3:23 PM] szybet
Idk how to put it so you understand


[2/9/2024 3:24 PM] szybet
I could afford it with a headache of "Thats a lot of money for not so much"


[2/9/2024 3:25 PM] nonridiculousadjective
460€ for RX 7700 XT + ~200€ CPU + 100€ RAM + 130€ SSD + ~100€ motherboard + <100€ power supply


[2/9/2024 3:26 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Yes, I am not telling you to buy it. I am just saying that a desktop would make it more worth for your buck


[2/9/2024 3:27 PM] szybet
1090, so 600$ for me so I can move it when I need it eassly - yea I'm fine with that


[2/9/2024 3:27 PM] szybet
just trying to explain how I think


[2/9/2024 3:28 PM] nonridiculousadjective
1090? Isn't gtx 1080 the highest?


[2/9/2024 3:28 PM] szybet
1090$, i summed you up


[2/9/2024 3:28 PM] nonridiculousadjective
Oh that, yeah


[2/9/2024 3:28 PM] nonridiculousadjective
600 for mobility is a lot when u said you don't move it around too much

Hi! i already asked this in  #chat, but is aura edition 2 v2 supported? I can't get it to boot. It boots with the original firmware, although touchscreen doesn't work.


[2/19/2024 12:12 AM] szybet
Touchscreen doesnt work in the original firmware after trying to boot inkbox?


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
Hmm


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
Maybe wrong device driver was run


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
What is your model number


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
N***


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] dferrg_30526
It didn't work before trying inkbox, and of course i don't expect it to work with it, i am just curious about the project


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
Aura se is n236


[2/19/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
That's the only aura we support


[2/19/2024 12:17 AM] dferrg_30526
It's n236 too, but there are two versions of it. You can determine which one you have looking at the 7th digit of it's serial number (0 for v1, 2 for v2 IIRC)


[2/19/2024 12:17 AM] tux_linux
Oooh


[2/19/2024 12:17 AM] tux_linux
Welp


[2/19/2024 12:17 AM] tux_linux

Don't have it here now


[2/19/2024 12:18 AM] dferrg_30526

[2/19/2024 12:19 AM] szybet
Well anyway, you can port the device now😄


[2/19/2024 12:21 AM] dferrg_30526
I could give it a try, and even could try to get a functional one (or buying a spare screen) eventually


[2/19/2024 12:21 AM] szybet
You could use the old one as a second screen, photo frame or smth


[2/19/2024 12:21 AM] szybet
Or even connect a mouse to it


[2/19/2024 12:21 AM] szybet
Its possible with inkbox

Has anyone tried Inkbox? - Discuss Online
It's a free software firmware replacement for ereaders based on Alpine Linux.
I've not tried it myself but wonder how it compares to the stock firmware on
Kobo, particularly in terms of battery life and general performance.

GNU Guix System
GNU Guix System or Guix System (previously known as GuixSD) is a rolling release, free and open source Linux distribution built around the GNU Guix package manager. It enables a declarative operating system configuration and allows system upgrades which the user can rollback. It uses the GNU Shepherd init system and the Linux-libre kernel, with ...

[2/20/2024 10:42 PM] mintpilo
Wouldn't supporting OPDS be like two birds one stone, and give you more of a generalized way to support way more catalogs, i. e. standardebooks?

Port*


[2/26/2024 11:07 AM] ansraer
So my old kindle paperwhite just died and I am looking for a new ebook reader on which I would like to run InkBox (really like the idea of a fully customizeable OS).
The thing is,I would really like to have a screen with more than 6", since my phone's screen is already bigger than that. Are there any devices you guys can recommend me? A quick look at the supported device list on github didn't result in any obvious choice, so I wanted to ask if there is a device that either already has ports in progress or should be fairly easy to port to.
If not I would be happy to kickstart the porting process for a new device that fits those criterias. I am a professional cpp dev, and while I myself have never worked with serial ports or kernel level code I am somewhat confident that I can figure things out if someone with more experience is willing to guide me. Obviously I would like to avoid devices/manufacturers that make this unnecessarily difficult by using proprietary hardware/drivers, so are there any device families that were more troublesome to support than others during past ports?


[2/26/2024 11:24 AM] szybet
Hmm... Idk about a device which is more than 6' - there is a kobo libra port but i think its hard to install? Idk @tux-linux explain
Kobo aura h20 is a bit above 6' and already booted inkbox, look up the porting thread
Kobo clara 2e should be very easy to port
Apart from that, any kobo which has an sd card and kernel sources available ( probably all of them ) should be able to be ported

Kobo's are awesome

You are a proffesionall dev and we are just students so you know more than us. Did i mention we look for contributors ;)?

Serial port is easy to use, no problems with that even we figured it out


[2/26/2024 11:26 AM] .nomadblue
Thanks! How would I do this? Lol I can access a web browser on the kindle but I haven’t taken it apart to see if there is an internal sd


[2/26/2024 11:27 AM] szybet
Look up porting threads


[2/26/2024 11:27 AM] szybet
Apart from that, figure out if its locked up


[2/26/2024 11:27 AM] szybet
Some kindles dont allow booting custom bootloaders and kernels, fuck amazon


[2/26/2024 11:27 AM] szybet
And yes, taking it apart is required


[2/26/2024 11:34 AM] ansraer
Hmm, I found the libra 2 thread in #porting and looking at the last few messages it would appear like progress is currently stalled.


[2/26/2024 11:35 AM] szybet
Im not sure what device it is exaclty


[2/26/2024 11:35 AM] szybet
Nicolas on yt videos shows a bigger ereader, idk which one is it


[2/26/2024 12:31 PM] .nomadblue
I don’t have an issue taking this thing apart. I have seen someone use a raspberry pi with a kindle paper white. Unsure if that process would work on this one (previous gen)


[2/26/2024 1:09 PM] szybet
Idk needs to be checked

We got the kernel sources recently


[2/26/2024 1:48 PM] szybet
For it


[2/27/2024 9:44 AM] ansraer
Oh, thats great news! Thats the device I am looking into right now.


[2/27/2024 12:20 PM] szybet
We didnt booted the kernel yet, we didnt checked if it really is there, the device had many revisions so you might buy a different one


[2/27/2024 12:20 PM] szybet
To keep in mind^


[2/27/2024 2:38 PM] ansraer
Out of curiosity, where exactly are the kernel sources located? I checked the kobo github, but that appears to be horribly out of date.


[2/27/2024 2:40 PM] ansraer
Yeah, hopefully I get the same rev you are already working on, or something that is similar enough that I can figure it out with a bit of help over the weekend.
Worst case I just re-flash the stock OS :/


[2/27/2024 2:41 PM] szybet
which ones


[2/27/2024 2:41 PM] ansraer
libra 2


[2/27/2024 2:41 PM] szybet
original manufacturers?


[2/27/2024 2:42 PM] szybet
its there, its just not described properly
kobo pointed us to the clara 2e sources which may indicate this kernel works for many devices - it works for kobo nia model a for example


[2/27/2024 2:42 PM] szybet
which is cool


[2/27/2024 2:42 PM] szybet
look up the porting threads, there is more info about this


[2/27/2024 2:46 PM] ansraer
That is weird, since they already have a libra2 folder as well.
And the clara 2e kernel tar on github is also more than a year old while there appear to be newer versions of the original OS.


[2/27/2024 2:47 PM] szybet
it probably depends on the revision


[2/27/2024 3:06 PM] ansraer
Yeah, I will figure it out somehow.

thats okay im more invested in the inkbox research and os more than anything else. Im also getting a clara 2e so to my knowledge i dont have a microsd slot, i think its all internal storage

are you serious


[2/27/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
its drm technology


[2/28/2024 7:14 AM] szybet
Thats exactly why we should hack them


[2/28/2024 8:00 AM] ansraer
If its only a rest/tcp/websocket API reverse engineering it should be fairly simple with tools such as wireshark. The troublesome thing is that interacting with a public API could count as "illegally accessign a private computer system". 🙁


[2/28/2024 8:10 AM] ansraer
So I have been thinking about how I could go about adding support for other novel formats and libraries (e.g. continously updating webnovels from royalroad, they are a guilty pressure of mine)


[2/28/2024 8:11 AM] ansraer
Right now my idea is to create an interface for book objects and remote libraries and then use the low level QT plugin API to let users load their own implementations of these classes.


[2/28/2024 8:13 AM] ansraer
As part of these proposed changes I would probably move the current default epub/pdf/etc novel object into one such extension that is statically linked into the app itself and always enabled.


[2/28/2024 8:15 AM] ansraer
The idea is to make it as easy as possible to add new novel formats / libraries for users. Basically if they want to read something we don't support out of the box they should be able to quickly write their own Inkbox plugin to add support.


[2/28/2024 8:15 AM] ansraer
Would such a change be accepted as a PR?


[2/28/2024 8:17 AM] ansraer
(Of course we would probably need to talk about security later on since out of the box QT plugins are just dyn libraries that are loaded at runtime, but adding some kind of signing check before loading them should be fairly simple)


[2/28/2024 8:50 AM] szybet
Yes


[2/28/2024 8:50 AM] szybet
They could be signed like all things in inkbox do


[2/28/2024 8:51 AM] szybet
In our new reader which is in the works we use mupdf


[2/28/2024 8:51 AM] szybet
Converting it to use a format class is possible for sure


[2/28/2024 8:52 AM] ansraer
Ah, thats good to know. Do you have this new reader on github somewhere?


[2/28/2024 8:53 AM] szybet
On my github inkbox fork, branch  named toreader

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/28/2024 8:53 AM] szybet
Basically every thing format dependeng would go to call a class


[2/28/2024 8:55 AM] ansraer
My idea was that the plugin's novel implementation would transform the book data into a generic format that is then sent to the reader.
So the reader would always get the same input format, and all the conversion happens in the plugin.


[2/28/2024 8:56 AM] szybet
Mupdf converts everything into html


[2/28/2024 8:56 AM] szybet
So that would be possible for sure


[2/28/2024 8:56 AM] ansraer
Ah, that sounds great!


[2/28/2024 8:57 AM] ansraer
hmm, does mupdf support css?


[2/28/2024 8:57 AM] ansraer
not realle relevant to the plugin system, but it would open up some interesting possibilites.


[2/28/2024 8:58 AM] szybet
Kind of a few things


[2/28/2024 8:58 AM] szybet
But qt subset of css is limited


[2/28/2024 8:58 AM] szybet
But we could build qt webengine 5.10 to enable more of it

But i wasnt able to cross compile it


[2/28/2024 9:00 AM] ansraer
Ah, so the QT Inkbox app calls Mupdf, which returns HTML code which is then rendered by QT?


[2/28/2024 9:01 AM] ansraer
I thought mupdf rendered the html to a framebuffer that was then embedded as an image, but keeping all the rendering in Inkbox itself sounds way better


[2/28/2024 9:01 AM] szybet
Its more complicated thsn that because we use mupdf library directly but yes


[2/28/2024 9:01 AM] szybet
Its not efficient and doesnt enable selecting the text, but yes possible it is


[2/28/2024 9:03 AM] ansraer
Good to know that Inkbox already includes the qt webengine. Adding that would have been another PR I might have looked into over the summer.
I would like to get interactive text adventures running on my ereader, and I know that many of them support html/js. So going that route would be faaar simpler than implementing my own text adventurer parser in c++ (especially given how many formats there are).


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] szybet
You didnt understand me, it doesnt include it because we wasnt able to compile it at all


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] szybet
Text adventures? We have an app for that


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] ansraer
Wait, how do you render the mupdf output without it?


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] szybet
Qtextbrowser


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] szybet
Which is very basic html and css


[2/28/2024 9:04 AM] ansraer
I ...did not even know that was a thing


[2/28/2024 9:05 AM] ansraer
Odd though that webengine isn't compiling, afaik that is a fairly popular module.
I take it there are only problems when compiling for the more exotic platforms?

But the releases on github aren't older than 1-3 years

You are right

There are 2 of us, we focused to get something working at all. Now its time to do it properlh


[2/28/2024 10:54 AM] szybet
Wifi what?


[2/28/2024 10:54 AM] ansraer
global::device::isWifiAble


[2/28/2024 10:55 AM] ansraer
which is only set when a config file exists, which, I pressume, is created manualy when you bundle inkbox as part of the OS


[2/28/2024 10:56 AM] szybet
The global thing is bad, its the main thing to rewrite


[2/28/2024 10:56 AM] szybet
But yes, this bool indicates if a device has working wifi ( probably )

Managed to get it running in 5 min


[2/28/2024 11:01 AM] ansraer
Problem are all the external files like e.g. the sh scripts, but imo all of them should just be brought into inkbox itself.
So ideally I would like inkbox to support running on a PC out of the box.


[2/28/2024 11:01 AM] szybet
Yes, sure


[2/28/2024 11:01 AM] szybet
But maybe first rewrite things to make them properly

Right now it just passes json objects around and deserializes what it needs, often repeatedly.


[2/28/2024 11:04 AM] ansraer
imo we should deserialize that once into a struct and then only pass that around. Would be far cleaner code


[2/28/2024 11:05 AM] ansraer
out of curiosity, what is `/mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/eink.qss`


[2/28/2024 11:12 AM] ansraer
ah, apparently that is the stylesheet.
Does this change between different e-readers or why isn't this just included in /resources?


[2/28/2024 11:12 AM] szybet
Its library metadata


[2/28/2024 11:13 AM] szybet
Different sizes, some adjustments

Making svg scale is hard, so yea. Maybe it could be one typical but im not sure its possible


[2/28/2024 11:14 AM] ansraer
Fuck this, I am PRing a platform refactor


[2/28/2024 11:14 AM] szybet
Yes, very cool


[2/28/2024 11:15 AM] szybet
If you are so invested i could give you access to one of my ereaders


[2/28/2024 11:15 AM] szybet
Via ssh


[2/28/2024 11:15 AM] szybet
I have already a tool to view the screen on pc


[2/28/2024 11:15 AM] ansraer
tbh I am fairly happy with my current setup. Since i plan to get it running on PC anyways.


[2/28/2024 11:16 AM] szybet
Okay


[2/28/2024 11:16 AM] ansraer
And I should hopefully have my libra2 soon. (Though I am still waiting for someone to test the kernel, cause thats something I have little experience with)


[2/28/2024 11:16 AM] szybet
@tux-linux please


[2/28/2024 11:17 AM] szybet
So i should probably give you the todo of what to refactor in inkbox code


[2/28/2024 11:17 AM] ansraer
Btw, would it be ok if I move the UI stuff (reader, home, library, splash, etc.) into a "ui" subfolder?


[2/28/2024 11:17 AM] ansraer
Maybe make a GH issue out of it?


[2/28/2024 11:17 AM] szybet
Yep


[2/28/2024 11:18 AM] szybet
No, just do it


[2/28/2024 11:18 AM] szybet
Widgets folder too


[2/28/2024 11:21 AM] ansraer
My goal would be something like:
```
inkbox/
  - api/
  - audio/
  - encryption/
  - platform/
  - ui/
    - splash/
    - home/
    ...
  - telemetry/
```


[2/28/2024 11:21 AM] szybet
I will post the todo later, cant on my phone


[2/28/2024 11:21 AM] szybet
Yes, cool


[2/28/2024 11:22 AM] szybet
Here are some ss of them

Some of the things you cant do, but refactoring code for sure

[2/28/2024 11:22 AM] szybet
+ my recent message at #dev


[2/28/2024 1:54 PM] ansraer
Hmm, will look into this some more after work.
What I could really need is a list of the different screen sizes (in pixels) that the supported devices have. Right now a lot of UI decisions (padding sizes, icon sizes, ...) are based on the device id, but imo going by screen size would make much more sense and also have the advantage to work out of the box for new devices once their screen size has been added.


[2/28/2024 1:57 PM] tux_linux
Not all devices have the same screen size despite having the same resolution


[2/28/2024 1:58 PM] tux_linux
Hence the need for device ids


[2/28/2024 1:58 PM] ansraer
Well, the current way of doing it just isn't feasible long term


[2/28/2024 1:58 PM] tux_linux
So yes it would be great but wouldn't be perfect for every device


[2/28/2024 2:00 PM] ansraer
Right now screen sizes are hard coded in massive if/else statements.
We either need to have a limited number of different icon sizes (e.g. small medium and large) that can be hardcoded for a specific device or we need a way to calculate icon sizes automatically based on data we have about the device (e.g. resolution and/or dpi)


[2/28/2024 2:11 PM] tux_linux
Yes, I already calculate icon sizes


[2/28/2024 2:12 PM] tux_linux
The current deviceID implementation should be improved but I don't really see how


[2/28/2024 2:26 PM] szybet
Via configs and classes


[2/29/2024 2:31 PM] tux_linux
@Ansraer do you have a fork of inkbox repo on github?


[2/29/2024 2:32 PM] ansraer
I am at work right now, will upload my stuff in 2 hours.


[2/29/2024 2:32 PM] ansraer
The device related stuff is pretty much done, I am fighting with functions.h right now.


[2/29/2024 2:33 PM] ansraer
That file contains way too much code from all over the project.


[2/29/2024 2:33 PM] ansraer
I am trying to split it up, but it is a difficult process.


[2/29/2024 2:33 PM] tux_linux
yea, thanks for your work


[2/29/2024 2:34 PM] ansraer
I will probably stop soonish and just PR what I have right now, I can continue cleaning stuff up as I refine and rewrite things during my next PRs.

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/29/2024 2:34 PM] tux_linux
it's better to leave functions.h unchanged for now until you redesign it completely then I think


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] ansraer
The one thing I really want to figure out is how I can make stylesheet loading better. Right now we are using hardcoded paths to qss files all over the place, so changing those styles would be a nightmare.
Having a small utility function that handles the majority of that would help to keep code duplication down while also giving us a single central spot we would need to edit if we want to change something.


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] tux_linux
the qss file is integrated into the binary


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] tux_linux
but yea


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] ansraer
The problem is that right now there isn't really a good spot where I can put a small utility function.


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] ansraer
uhm no?


[2/29/2024 2:37 PM] ansraer
Since it has device specific overwrites it is loaded from outside the binary


[2/29/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/29/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/29/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
sorry
i was confused from when it was integrated in the binary


[2/29/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
that was before we had different screen sizes


[2/29/2024 2:38 PM] tux_linux
but it's a fixed path in the os


[2/29/2024 2:39 PM] ansraer
So we have  dozens of hardcoded paths to a random location on the filesystem, that only work when the app is running on the custom OS.


[2/29/2024 2:39 PM] ansraer
it is fixed, but every time the Stylesheet is loaded it needs to supply the full path:


[2/29/2024 2:39 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/29/2024 2:39 PM] tux_linux
thanks qt


[2/29/2024 2:43 PM] ansraer
```cpp
QFile stylesheetFile("/mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/eink.qss");
stylesheetFile.open(QFile::ReadOnly);
w.setStyleSheet(stylesheetFile.readAll());
stylesheetFile.close();
```
We have the above code snippet dozens of times throughout the code base. I would prefer it if we could do something along the lines of:
```cpp
Style::applyStyle(&w, "eink");
```
This way we won't need to make sure that everything uses the same path (since that is handled by the function) while also having a really easy option to switch the path when running on a platform where we don't control the devices full file system.


[2/29/2024 2:44 PM] ansraer
The thing is that right now I have no clue where to put this. Since I REALLY don't want to add any new code to functions.h


[2/29/2024 2:46 PM] tux_linux
yea
maybe a macro


[2/29/2024 2:47 PM] tux_linux
at worst


[2/29/2024 3:06 PM] szybet
No, let it finally burn


[2/29/2024 3:08 PM] szybet
@tux-linux @Ansraer applying stylesheet from a file should and is app wide, so its not needed everywhere

Look at sanki code, it uses it only once

As for how to use it on PC... Just include it in the binary if the target is PC, some ifdefs will do for that


[2/29/2024 3:08 PM] ansraer
Uhm... The current codebase does it 25 times


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] szybet
Yea we were really stupid


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] ansraer
at least. Search for "stylesheetFile("


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] ansraer
So, when and where should I do this instead?


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] tux_linux
no, it is


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] tux_linux
qt is fucked


[2/29/2024 3:09 PM] szybet

How do I fix my micro SD card that became a read-only memory card?
Answer (1 of 23): A micro SD card becoming read-only can be frustrating, but there are several ways to try and fix it. Here are some methods you can try, starting with the least intrusive and progressively moving towards more advanced options:

But overall it's amazing there is a huge work behind this project


[3/20/2024 5:31 PM] leo_chrom
I'm still learning how to use the user apps and how kobox works


[3/20/2024 6:13 PM] szybet
WHY DONT YOU ASK :(?


[3/20/2024 6:13 PM] leo_chrom
What's wrong


[3/20/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius

i have been using my kobo nia with keyboard for a year in school


[3/20/2024 6:14 PM] leo_chrom
Well idk what I'm doing wrong but it's not doing anything


[3/20/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
the TLDR is that you need to charge your Nia and change a few things inside the device


[3/20/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
a few commands


[3/20/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
first root your device


[3/20/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
kobox is a bit bad, i suggest you turn it off


[3/20/2024 6:16 PM] leo_chrom
Oh, well I'm not too experienced


[3/20/2024 6:17 PM] szybet
this is a project which uses a custom PCB and 3d printed parts to create a modular laptop, look up here: https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/tree/main/keyboard


[3/20/2024 6:17 PM] leo_chrom
Oh ok


[3/20/2024 6:17 PM] leo_chrom
I'll try thank you


[3/20/2024 6:17 PM] szybet
so it's a overkill solution to what you are trying to do


[3/20/2024 6:18 PM] szybet
yea i propose you ask me everything about usb otg because i have spent one year making it work with inkbox


[3/20/2024 6:19 PM] leo_chrom
allright


[3/20/2024 6:20 PM] leo_chrom
Seems like it's well spent time


[3/20/2024 6:20 PM] leo_chrom
Bc it's so useful with a keyboard


[3/20/2024 6:21 PM] szybet
for a year I have been writing notes on it in school


[3/20/2024 6:21 PM] szybet
worked awesome


[3/20/2024 6:21 PM] leo_chrom
Wow


[3/20/2024 6:22 PM] szybet
It's a full working prototype


[3/20/2024 6:22 PM] szybet
would need a 2.0 version for sure but yea


[3/20/2024 6:22 PM] leo_chrom
ofc it is i've just installed yesterday lol


[3/20/2024 6:23 PM] szybet
I mean the niaudio thing


[3/20/2024 6:23 PM] szybet
inkbox supports USB in a fair way


[3/20/2024 6:23 PM] szybet
electronics etc.


[3/20/2024 6:23 PM] leo_chrom
great


[3/20/2024 6:25 PM] [matrix] andi1
yes, usb on the kobos is nice


[3/20/2024 6:25 PM] leo_chrom
so basically you can connect lots of pheripals


[3/20/2024 6:25 PM] [matrix] andi1
I am also using it in an unusual way


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] [matrix] andi1
if you provide the external power


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] [matrix] andi1
yes


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] szybet
it depends


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] szybet
now it's a yes


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] szybet
making hot plugging input devices was hard


[3/20/2024 6:26 PM] szybet
mouse support was hard to implement too


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
audio support is still complicated


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] [matrix] andi1
what is a bit nasty: if you have old kernels and usb devices not supported by them


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] leo_chrom
how nia can play audio


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] leo_chrom
you need an ext speaker


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] [matrix] andi1
usb soundcard


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
Via usb sound card ;p


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] leo_chrom
ohhh


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
that's the thing why i created this thing


[3/20/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
it has a slot on the back where the usb audio card slides in


[3/20/2024 6:29 PM] leo_chrom
so basically with feather notes otg keyboard is supported


[3/20/2024 6:29 PM] szybet
mouse too


[3/20/2024 6:29 PM] szybet
keyboard in rss guard also works


[3/20/2024 6:29 PM] szybet
audio is complicated but can be done to work


[3/20/2024 6:30 PM] szybet
but yes, feathernotes was my main target


[3/20/2024 6:32 PM] leo_chrom
amazing


[3/20/2024 6:33 PM] leo_chrom
i always wondered if it was possible to mess around with a kobo nia but i didn't know that all of this was possible


[3/20/2024 6:33 PM] szybet
everything is possible if you spend enough time on it


[3/20/2024 6:33 PM] szybet
I spend a year


[3/20/2024 6:34 PM] leo_chrom
well now i have a strange problem


[3/20/2024 6:34 PM] leo_chrom
i put feather notes inside .apps folder but it disappeared


[3/20/2024 6:36 PM] szybet
what


[3/20/2024 6:36 PM] leo_chrom
yes i tried 2 times already


[3/20/2024 6:36 PM] szybet
you unmounted it incorrectly?


[3/20/2024 6:36 PM] leo_chrom
no


[3/20/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
whatever, root your device

you won't be able to make usb work without rooting the device anyway


[3/20/2024 6:40 PM] leo_chrom
but do you need any particular hardware?


[3/20/2024 6:41 PM] szybet
nope, not really


[3/20/2024 6:41 PM] leo_chrom
so how can i do it is it in here?


[3/20/2024 6:42 PM] szybet
you mean what

ye i already read the wiki didn't notice this article


[3/20/2024 6:43 PM] szybet

[3/20/2024 6:44 PM] leo_chrom
yes but after this what i get


[3/20/2024 6:44 PM] leo_chrom
the usb thing?


[3/20/2024 6:45 PM] szybet
I will give you a funny command and it will make your usb work


[3/20/2024 6:45 PM] szybet
after that we will see


[3/20/2024 6:45 PM] szybet
also figure out a way to power the device while having the keyboard plugged in


[3/20/2024 6:46 PM] leo_chrom
yes but if i do this procedure basically i'm able to do more intresting things


[3/20/2024 6:47 PM] szybet
rooting the device? yes, obviously

since i don't have linux installed is it all possible on a live cd?


[3/20/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
yea


[3/20/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
or virtualbox


[3/20/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
maybe virtualbox or wsl, you will waste time booting the things


[3/20/2024 6:50 PM] leo_chrom
i've got wsl but it's a mess when you have ext devices


[3/20/2024 6:51 PM] szybet

wait for szybet
he designed user apps


[3/20/2024 6:58 PM] szybet
create an empty folder, unmount, mount and check if it exists


[3/20/2024 6:58 PM] szybet
also root the device as i said to upload the app manually


[3/20/2024 6:59 PM] leo_chrom
Well I can't do that right now since I don't have much time left


[3/20/2024 6:59 PM] tux_linux
you can just launch diags process to root it

But I'll try to make the folder

Really?

you need to do it anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

go to diags->reset as root

will take ~20m


[3/20/2024 7:00 PM] tux_linux
also


[3/20/2024 7:00 PM] tux_linux
leave it plugged in


[3/20/2024 7:00 PM] leo_chrom
Uh. Diagnostics?


[3/20/2024 7:00 PM] tux_linux
click power button repeatedly at boot

only when you change tabs

yea, but now try to unplug it


[3/20/2024 9:18 PM] leo_chrom
Well it's not updating


[3/20/2024 9:19 PM] leo_chrom
But the point is that the keyboard seems to work but then it turns off


[3/20/2024 9:19 PM] tux_linux
do you have another one to play around with


[3/20/2024 9:19 PM] leo_chrom
Another what


[3/20/2024 9:19 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2024 9:19 PM] leo_chrom
Oh yes


[3/20/2024 9:22 PM] leo_chrom

its on the same subnet

.2.x


[3/20/2024 10:03 PM] tux_linux

ok but now you get to something


[3/20/2024 10:06 PM] leo_chrom
what do you mean


[3/20/2024 10:07 PM] tux_linux
`busybox telnetd -F -l /bin/sh`


[3/20/2024 10:07 PM] tux_linux
launch this from iterm


[3/20/2024 10:07 PM] tux_linux
see if you can `telnet 192.168.2.103`


[3/20/2024 10:08 PM] leo_chrom
Still in kobo:~# ?

yea
but thats only telnet


[3/20/2024 10:11 PM] tux_linux
half bad


[3/20/2024 10:12 PM] leo_chrom
And why ssh doesn't want to work


[3/20/2024 10:12 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/20/2024 10:12 PM] tux_linux
maybe try `restart sshd`


[3/20/2024 10:12 PM] leo_chrom
Where


[3/20/2024 10:13 PM] tux_linux
in the prompt


[3/20/2024 10:13 PM] tux_linux
kobo prompt


[3/20/2024 10:13 PM] leo_chrom

to run telnet headless omit `-F` option


[3/20/2024 10:15 PM] tux_linux
so you can quit iterm


[3/20/2024 10:15 PM] tux_linux
it should work

[3/20/2024 10:16 PM] tux_linux
because you have a local ssh session from iterm


[3/20/2024 10:16 PM] tux_linux
it wont suspend the device


[3/20/2024 10:16 PM] leo_chrom
Oh


[3/20/2024 10:16 PM] tux_linux
it knows youre doing something


[3/20/2024 10:18 PM] leo_chrom
Now what should I do


[3/20/2024 10:18 PM] tux_linux
btw, fun thing: `notify-send "hello there"`


[3/20/2024 10:18 PM] tux_linux
maybe try sshing via usbnet


[3/20/2024 10:18 PM] tux_linux
you need to set usb interfaces' ip address to 192.168.2.1


[3/20/2024 10:19 PM] tux_linux
but since you have a bad wifi router that is on the same subnet, you should `echo 192.168.3.2 > /boot/flags/USBNET_IP` before, then `restart usbnet`


[3/20/2024 10:19 PM] tux_linux
then set kobo interface ip address to 192.168.3.1


[3/20/2024 10:19 PM] leo_chrom
Bad?


[3/20/2024 10:19 PM] tux_linux
kobo's ip will be 192.168.3.2


[3/20/2024 10:19 PM] tux_linux
youwill be 192.168.3.1


[3/20/2024 10:20 PM] tux_linux
im just saying routers like that annoy me


[3/20/2024 10:20 PM] tux_linux
nothing against your router


[3/20/2024 10:20 PM] tux_linux
because they use a random subnet


[3/20/2024 10:20 PM] tux_linux
why not just .0 or .1


[3/20/2024 10:20 PM] leo_chrom

[3/20/2024 10:38 PM] tux_linux
thats probably better


[3/20/2024 10:47 PM] szybet
just use a hotspot ;/


[3/20/2024 10:56 PM] leo_chrom

Hi! I've got a Kobo Touch N905B. Can I assume that the internal uSD card has both the OS as well as well as the books that were loaded onto the device? And also, how big an uSD card will work? Could I put a 64G card in there?

if you flash inkbox image to 64g card, it will only show 512m of storage; you need to resize it

does it hurt an e-ink display to play an animation at high speed that doesn't overwrite pixels from previous frames? like it will never turn off a pixel during an animation, only turn them on


[3/29/2024 11:52 PM] szybet
lets put it like that


[3/29/2024 11:52 PM] szybet
everything i have done with eink ( developing inkbox, running the high speed screen mirror, sanki, other things ) have done nothing to my nia


[3/29/2024 11:53 PM] szybet
einks are really robust


[3/29/2024 11:53 PM] szybet
at least the one on my nia


[3/29/2024 11:53 PM] kuratius
This reads like word salad


[3/29/2024 11:53 PM] kuratius
there is no concept of turning pixels on or off for an eink display


[3/29/2024 11:54 PM] ewired
since it's a monochrome display, I mean black is on and white is off


[3/29/2024 11:54 PM] kuratius
that's not how it works


[3/29/2024 11:55 PM] ewired
it's a metaphor then I guess lol


[3/29/2024 11:56 PM] ewired
I mean an animation that will never change the state of the same pixel twice


[3/29/2024 11:56 PM] ewired
since a you can run a high speed screen mirror, which changes the state of the same pixels very frequently, it's probably OK, probably does wear down the screen a bit more


[3/29/2024 11:56 PM] kuratius
I mean you can avoid ghosting that way


[3/29/2024 11:56 PM] kuratius
but the only usecase for that is a progress bar lol


[3/29/2024 11:57 PM] kuratius
maybe you mean avoiding reaffirming the state or something


[3/29/2024 11:57 PM] ewired
in android apps, with material design, there are buttons and other elements that have a growing circle animation when you tap/click them


[3/29/2024 11:57 PM] kuratius
like driving an already black pixel to black again


[3/29/2024 11:58 PM] ewired
yeah, I also would want to avoid that if it does damage to the screen


[3/29/2024 11:58 PM] kuratius
but that's handled by the display chip you dont get to see that unless you are making a custom waveform


[3/29/2024 11:58 PM] ewired
that's good, I figured that would be handled by a buffer on the hardware level


[3/29/2024 11:59 PM] ewired
I just had a passing thought about whether those material design animations would work on a kobo without wearing down the display more than a static solid button would


[3/29/2024 11:59 PM] kuratius
you dont really wear down the display in any meaningful sense


[3/30/2024 12:01 AM] kuratius
You can maybe reduce ghosting and screen damage issues if your waveform is bad by making sure you display an equal amount of black/white on average


[3/30/2024 12:01 AM] kuratius
You're confusing eink screens with oleds


[3/30/2024 12:02 AM] ewired
this is an example of the animation I'm talking about btw

[3/30/2024 12:03 AM] ewired
ok that's good to know, I thought changing the state of a pixel repeatedly would cause damage to an e-ink screen


[3/30/2024 12:04 AM] kuratius
if you do this as a partial refresh and you do a fast refresh rather an full fresh for those pixels to play the animation faster you're going to get ghosting but ghosting isnt screen damage


[3/30/2024 12:05 AM] kuratius
ghosting is just the actual position of the coloured particles and the intended position being desynced


[3/30/2024 12:05 AM] kuratius
Basically you have a slightly wrong shade of gray, you get rid of it by doing a full black/white cycle


[3/30/2024 12:05 AM] szybet
here is the real problem: such animation will be ugly on eink


[3/30/2024 12:06 AM] kuratius
actual screen damage is when you drive the particles to black for too long or with too high voltage for example, then you get clumping issues and things like that


[3/30/2024 12:07 AM] kuratius
they normally repel each other but if you overcome the repulsion they can stick together and become harder to move


[3/30/2024 12:07 AM] kuratius
that's actual screen damage


[3/30/2024 12:07 AM] kuratius
but like I said that only happens if your waveform is bad


[3/30/2024 12:07 AM] tux_linux
So then it should never happen


[3/30/2024 12:07 AM] kuratius
if you dont write waveforms for your display and you assume the people who made the display arent idiots you dont worry about it


[3/30/2024 12:08 AM] ewired
they pay far too much money for e-ink display drivers to be that bad... hopefully


[3/30/2024 12:09 AM] kuratius
There are people who hack together eink drivers for displays that arent supposed to support greyscale


[3/30/2024 12:09 AM] kuratius
like those pricetag eink displays

This is probably way too old to hold true today


[3/30/2024 12:10 AM] kuratius
if you want your code to run on those then maybe you can think about it, as those drivers are basically doing things not tested by the manfacturer


[3/30/2024 12:11 AM] ewired
all I know is the software end where sending a bitmap to the display is abstracted away from me, and bits in the bitmap correspond to pixels being black or white, just want to make sure I'm not destroying my kobo by sending a bunch of screen updates to mimic material design animations


[3/30/2024 12:11 AM] tux_linux
But it is going to look bad though


[3/30/2024 12:11 AM] kuratius
any black/white eink display with programmable waveforms can do greyscale if you write a custom driver for it, but then the driver has to handle making sure it doesnt damage anything


[3/30/2024 12:12 AM] tux_linux
Kuratius has been awarded the "eink display wizard" title


[3/30/2024 12:12 AM] tux_linux
Thanks for your insight


[3/30/2024 12:12 AM] ewired
I've been doing greyscale by dithering so far


[3/30/2024 12:13 AM] kuratius
that's not what I'm talking about


[3/30/2024 12:13 AM] ewired
I investigated whether plato actually sent greyscale colors to the hardware but afaik it just does dithering and monochrome


[3/30/2024 12:13 AM] kuratius
that's weird


[3/30/2024 12:13 AM] kuratius
kobos can do real greyscale without weird workarounds


[3/30/2024 12:15 AM] ewired
I need to look into it more, all my evidence comes from the 'sketch' applet in plato that saves images in PNG greyscale, but the pixels are apparently only fully black or white, and it uses a dithering pattern for different shades of grey


[3/30/2024 12:16 AM] kuratius
that's probably because sketch needs to refresh fast


[3/30/2024 12:16 AM] ewired
ahhh ok that makes sense, maybe if I loaded a greyscale PNG image in sketch it would work fine


[3/30/2024 12:16 AM] kuratius
black/white refreshes typically happen faster than greyscale stuff


[3/30/2024 12:17 AM] ewired
this whole time I thought e-ink displays were just monochrome, hence why I said "pixels on/off" earlier lol


[3/30/2024 12:18 AM] kuratius
I think it's because the greyscale stuff is done using testing and calibration, you need to control the particle position very precisely , with a black/white pixel you just go full throttle


[3/30/2024 12:19 AM] kuratius
I'm pretty sure you could do greyscale refreshes at the same speed as a white/black refresh with the right waveform, but you'd have severe ghosting after a few refreshes, which is not something you have to worry about with black/white


[3/30/2024 12:20 AM] ewired
I will leave that one for the experts for now, thanks for the info


[3/30/2024 12:23 AM] kuratius
eink displays are particle accelerators 😛


[3/30/2024 12:43 AM] szybet
exactly.


[3/30/2024 12:44 AM] szybet
yes because it uses A2 waveform mode


[3/30/2024 12:44 AM] szybet
@Kuratius you should really write a pdf / github repo of einks displays explained to dummy developers and people :(
