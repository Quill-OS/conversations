looks good


[8/26/2022 9:57 PM] tux_linux
is it possible to generate bigger images with stable-diffusion?


[8/26/2022 9:57 PM] aryetis
you're limited by your GPU vram


[8/26/2022 9:57 PM] tux_linux
ok


[8/26/2022 9:57 PM] aryetis
got 8gb and I can do 576x576 max

But you can upscale it afterwards with stuff like https://github.com/jquesnelle/txt2imghd (haven't used it yet)

[8/26/2022 10:06 PM] tux_linux
there's the 'box' component you forgot


[8/26/2022 10:06 PM] tux_linux
represents chroot, conainers, unshare, namespaces, etc.

If you want to give stable-diffusion a try online. https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream (you've got about 200 generations or so for free I believe... But you've got to create an account)


[8/26/2022 10:26 PM] tux_linux
I will install it on my computer


[8/26/2022 10:27 PM] tux_linux
I will install it on Ubuntu because AMD rocm drivers on Gentoo are crap

oof you're probably gonna get stuck at 256x256 resolution


[8/26/2022 10:34 PM] tux_linux
the cpu repo seems like a WIP


[8/26/2022 10:34 PM] tux_linux
but last commit was 5 days ago, so I have hope


[8/26/2022 10:35 PM] aryetis
stable-diffusion has been released like 5 days ago lol <https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release>


[8/26/2022 10:35 PM] aryetis

yeah I don't get much results with that kind of prompts either I try to simplify the work for the AI by only using nouns and verbs, seperate each concept with a comma, etc

{Reactions}

[8/26/2022 11:00 PM] aryetis
You'll get different results with different phrasing and natural language processing algorithms


[8/26/2022 11:19 PM] aryetis
But honestly a logo is probably one of the hardest think to ask to an AI. logo are often very abstract and with hidden meaning.


[8/26/2022 11:20 PM] szybet
hey, i got some good results already


[8/26/2022 11:20 PM] aryetis
Yeah I'm honestly really impressed


[8/26/2022 11:25 PM] aryetis
But I can see how most of those are  "simple"  logos stitched together. 
What I mean is because of the way a neural network work you have to be able to cut the task you're asking the AI into very very very simple problems. Wants picture of a cat ? sure one neuron will check if there's a circle that can ressemble the shape of a cat head, one neuron will check if there's a left ear, one neuron will check if there's a right ear, fur check ? whiskers ? etc


[8/26/2022 11:25 PM] aryetis
But I'd have no idea how a neural network would work for a logo.


[8/26/2022 11:25 PM] aryetis
it's so abstract


[8/26/2022 11:25 PM] szybet
logo is always something


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] szybet
also most logo on the internet are 2d, are in a circle, have white background etc


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] szybet
😉


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] aryetis
yet they vary so much


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] szybet
also logo = icons sometimes


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] szybet
which can help


[8/26/2022 11:26 PM] aryetis
I mean I can see what's a "background logo", I can see how one can link "logo" and "text/title" together


[8/26/2022 11:27 PM] aryetis
but yeah.... it's hard


[8/26/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
i didnt asked for text


[8/26/2022 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
