@pibaoi welcome to the porting thread


[12/3/2022 9:35 AM] jeremiah_weeds
I have this ereader, but not sure how to start helping with porting


[12/4/2022 3:01 PM] szybet
Oh sory


[12/4/2022 3:01 PM] szybet
i didn't saw the message


[12/4/2022 3:01 PM] szybet
well maybe look at the clara porting thread when atro began, you will have an idea of whats needed


[12/4/2022 10:12 PM] szybet
@jeremiah_weeds pinging you so you see the message


[12/6/2022 6:33 AM] szybet
wake up samurai


[12/6/2022 6:33 AM] szybet
we have a ereader to port


[12/6/2022 6:33 AM] szybet

[2/15/2024 12:48 AM] angus9356
Hi


[2/15/2024 12:48 AM] tux_linux
A good way to start would be to wire up serial to your device
Do you have some technical background or linux knowledge?


[2/15/2024 12:49 AM] angus9356
I'm a linux kernel contributor and I have 25 years embedded experience


[2/15/2024 12:49 AM] tux_linux
WOOOOOOO


[2/15/2024 12:50 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet we got the jackpot


[2/15/2024 12:50 AM] angus9356
There seem to be 2 serial ports. One near the top of the board and one near the bottom


[2/15/2024 12:50 AM] tux_linux
i am 18 and szybet is 19
we are the maintainers of inkbox os
if you wanted to know


[2/15/2024 12:50 AM] tux_linux
Yes
Do you have a picture of the pcb?


[2/15/2024 12:51 AM] angus9356
Thats awesome thanks for the hard work

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/15/2024 12:51 AM] tux_linux
Usually there is a way to know which one is the right one by looking at the order of the pins


[2/15/2024 12:52 AM] angus9356

[2/15/2024 12:52 AM] tux_linux
the one at the top is probably the right one


[2/15/2024 12:52 AM] tux_linux
so i guess you know how to connect to it


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] angus9356
That was my guess based on the proximity to the SOC


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] tux_linux
maybe share the initial boot log


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] tux_linux
usually in kobos the order is v,tx,rx,gnd


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] tux_linux
so the other one is probably something else


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] angus9356
It's makred on the PCB


[2/15/2024 12:53 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/15/2024 12:54 AM] angus9356
Should it go into UUU mode without the SD card in it ?


[2/15/2024 12:55 AM] tux_linux
I dont think so


[2/15/2024 12:55 AM] tux_linux
it will probably just hang


[2/15/2024 12:55 AM] tux_linux
at least that is what other kobos do


[2/15/2024 12:55 AM] tux_linux
there is probably a way to enter download mode with some mw sequence in u-boot


[2/15/2024 12:55 AM] tux_linux
@andi knows more about that than me


[2/15/2024 12:56 AM] tux_linux
he is our low-level/linux/u-boot wizard


[2/15/2024 12:56 AM] tux_linux
but in theory it should (i think) allow you to enter u-boot if you press a key on the serial console


[2/15/2024 12:56 AM] tux_linux
though some older kobos have bootdelay set to 0


[2/15/2024 12:57 AM] tux_linux
that is something you can change but it's some fiddling


[2/15/2024 1:00 AM] angus9356
Boot capture

[2/15/2024 1:00 AM] angus9356
sd card is in bad shape


[2/15/2024 1:02 AM] tux_linux
still that 2009.08 u-boot


[2/15/2024 1:03 AM] tux_linux
well yea, it doesn't seem very healthy


[2/15/2024 1:03 AM] tux_linux
maybe you should back up the unpartitioned space


[2/15/2024 1:04 AM] tux_linux
can you issue fdisk -l on your kobo?


[2/15/2024 1:04 AM] angus9356
I tried imaging it. I think the card is toast


[2/15/2024 1:04 AM] tux_linux
well, the only important thing is what lies before the first partition


[2/15/2024 1:05 AM] angus9356
It copied the first 2GB


[2/15/2024 1:06 AM] tux_linux
that's enough


[2/15/2024 1:06 AM] tux_linux
do you have another microsd card lying around


[2/15/2024 1:06 AM] angus9356
Yup I'm putting the N905 image on it right now


[2/15/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
im not sure its a good idea


[2/15/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
the eink screen is probably not the same


[2/15/2024 1:07 AM] angus9356
Ok it seemed to use the same kernel version so I assumed that might be the closest rootfs

[2/15/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
read the 'waveform' part


[2/15/2024 1:08 AM] angus9356
I've heard of eink waveforms from working with the pinenote


[2/15/2024 1:09 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/15/2024 1:09 AM] tux_linux
well then you know what problems it could cause


[2/15/2024 1:09 AM] angus9356
Yup I think I might have broken the touchscreen getting it apart anyway


[2/15/2024 1:09 AM] tux_linux
oops


[2/15/2024 1:10 AM] angus9356
Yep


[2/15/2024 1:10 AM] tux_linux
hm


[2/15/2024 1:10 AM] tux_linux
so what will you do


[2/15/2024 1:10 AM] angus9356
Get the kernel working then either replace the screen or get a second hand device


[2/15/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
well, nice


[2/15/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
if you dont care about your screen i guess you can try with the n905c image


[2/15/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
but it might also brick the device permanently


[2/15/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
so you know the risks


[2/15/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
esp. if the power regulator is not the same


[2/15/2024 1:13 AM] angus9356
There's a third serial port


[2/15/2024 1:13 AM] tux_linux
possible


[2/15/2024 1:15 AM] angus9356
The PMIC is a TPS65185


[2/15/2024 1:26 AM] tux_linux
from memory its the same as n905c


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] angus9356
Hmm ok I didn't see it in the config


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] tux_linux
but its not a guarantee that it will work


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] angus9356
Just cloned the kernel repo


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] tux_linux
look at n905c u-boot code


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] tux_linux
there are probably more references to the pmic there


[2/15/2024 1:27 AM] tux_linux
and you can compare with the n250 uboot sources


[2/15/2024 1:28 AM] angus9356
Oh right thats probably where the PMIC will get configured


[2/15/2024 1:28 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/15/2024 1:28 AM] angus9356
Where would I find the n250 u-boot ? would it be on mainline ?


[2/15/2024 1:29 AM] tux_linux
no

[2/15/2024 1:35 AM] angus9356
So just putting that u-boot and kernel onto the n905 image might work


[2/15/2024 1:36 AM] tux_linux
no guarantee


[2/15/2024 1:36 AM] tux_linux
but maybe


[2/15/2024 1:36 AM] tux_linux
m a y  b e


[2/15/2024 1:36 AM] tux_linux
though i fear a bit about the screen


[2/15/2024 1:42 AM] angus9356
Well touchscreen still works. Needs the bezel attached ??


[2/15/2024 1:43 AM] angus9356
So I should be waiting for @Szybet  for guidance ?


[2/15/2024 1:43 AM] tux_linux
the bezel thing is normal


[2/15/2024 1:43 AM] tux_linux
szybet doesn't have any of these old devices


[2/15/2024 1:43 AM] tux_linux
well, maybe the glo


[2/15/2024 1:43 AM] tux_linux
n613


[2/15/2024 1:44 AM] angus9356
Ok whos going to help extract the wavefrom and get u-boot and kernel running is that you ?


[2/15/2024 1:44 AM] tux_linux
its prob. an ir grid


[2/15/2024 1:45 AM] angus9356
Ok gotta go to a meeting back in an hour or so


[2/15/2024 2:34 AM] angus9356
There 2K lines difference between the default u-boot and the inkbox  imx507 u-boot


[2/15/2024 2:39 AM] angus9356
Where are the waveforms stored ?


[2/15/2024 2:47 AM] tux_linux
Check the boot log


[2/15/2024 2:48 AM] tux_linux

```


[2/15/2024 2:48 AM] tux_linux
somewhere in there probably


[2/15/2024 2:49 AM] tux_linux
iirc it was at offset 14335 or 14336


[2/15/2024 2:50 AM] angus9356
14336 is the largest one


[2/15/2024 2:50 AM] angus9356
The first 2 are probably the u-boot env ?


[2/15/2024 2:58 AM] angus9356
Does the kernel or u-boot load the waveform ?


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
I think it's loaded by u-boot


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
possible


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
maybe see a hexdump or smth


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
or binwalk


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] angus9356
Thanks that was my assumption so it could display the logo

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
well theres no logo displayed


[2/15/2024 3:02 AM] tux_linux
but yea


[2/15/2024 3:03 AM] angus9356
Ha yep no "logo" header

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/15/2024 7:06 AM] szybet
Finally


[2/15/2024 7:07 AM] szybet
Idk about waveform and device tree. It may not exost for this device?


[2/15/2024 7:08 AM] szybet
Yea, binwalk needed or smth, we need to know what things are needed


[2/15/2024 7:29 AM] szybet
You could also upload the image somewhere for us to download, we could have a look at it too and help


[2/15/2024 8:11 AM] szybet
Its an IR touchscreen probably


[2/15/2024 9:02 AM] andi15701

[2/15/2024 9:05 AM] andi15701
if you have the courage about going mainline


[2/15/2024 9:07 AM] andi15701
so this one is imx5? PMIC is what?


[2/15/2024 9:07 AM] andi15701
tps65185 is only for the EPD


[2/15/2024 9:09 AM] andi15701
so what kind of chips do we have?


[2/15/2024 9:09 AM] andi15701
I brought several ebook readers to near-mainline


[2/15/2024 9:11 AM] andi15701
so if you have experience in kernel contributing, that might be feasible


[2/15/2024 9:12 AM] andi15701
we might need just to create a devicetree and some fiddling here and there


[2/15/2024 9:22 AM] andi15701
some theory here: Kobo uses a few almost identical kernels and have just a generic board file, but it gets a blob containing some hardware information to adapt to the different boards, that blob gets loaded into ram and the address is passed over to the kernel by u-boot


[2/15/2024 9:22 AM] andi15701
but if we manage to get this device working with something near-mainline


[2/15/2024 9:23 AM] andi15701
probably it is a step towards deorbiting 2.6 kernels from inkbox


[2/15/2024 9:23 AM] andi15701
so less userspace compatibility issues


[2/15/2024 10:29 AM] szybet
What blob


[2/15/2024 10:29 AM] szybet
device tree?


[2/15/2024 3:29 PM] andi15701
I mean the hwconfig thing


[2/15/2024 3:33 PM] andi15701
the <=3.0 kernels do not use devicetree. The main issue is probably EPDC, I think there is no official support for imx5 even in 4.1. But if I understand the code correctly, is still seems to be there behind EPDC_VERSION < 20 checks


[2/15/2024 3:33 PM] andi15701
That all is nothing I could do remotely without having access to the device


[2/15/2024 3:33 PM] angus9356
I think this is the hwconfig block

[2/15/2024 3:44 PM] szybet
what about configuring inkbox to boot from the external sd card?


[2/15/2024 3:44 PM] szybet
there was somewhere talks that its possible


[2/15/2024 3:45 PM] szybet
idk how it went, maybe you need 2 sd cards?


[2/15/2024 3:45 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/15/2024 3:45 PM] angus9356
Could modify the u-boot env on the internal card to use the initrd and rootfs from the external card


[2/15/2024 3:46 PM] szybet
maybe the best solution is to enable this option but if there is no sd card, boot the internal one


[2/15/2024 3:47 PM] tux_linux
yes
maybe you could load another u-boot from the sd card as well


[2/15/2024 3:48 PM] szybet
.
dont force users 2 use 2 sd cards


[2/15/2024 3:48 PM] angus9356
I'm assuming that there is no user info in the first 2 partitions but I think I'd perfer to IM one or both of you the dump of partitions 1 and 2


[2/15/2024 3:52 PM] angus9356
562 MB so I'll need to upload it somewhere just a minute


[2/15/2024 3:52 PM] andi15701
there is some serial somewhere, but not in the hwconfig partition

or kernel


[2/15/2024 3:55 PM] angus9356
I've already given away the serial in the photo 🙂


[2/15/2024 3:58 PM] angus9356
Partition file is ready to download


[2/15/2024 3:58 PM] tux_linux
it's out of warranty anyway 😉


[2/15/2024 4:01 PM] angus9356
I had a brief look at the u-boot source differences from the kobo u-boot and the inkbox u-boot and there were only 2086 lines different and most of those didn't seem relevant


[2/15/2024 4:06 PM] andi15701
you are aware of arch/arm/boot/dts/nxp/imx/imx50-kobo-aura.dts?


[2/15/2024 4:06 PM] andi15701
so that can be a starting point for any mainline activities


[2/15/2024 4:07 PM] angus9356
I hadn't looked at the device tree yet


[2/15/2024 4:07 PM] angus9356
I figured getting the kobo kernel and u-boot working would be the first steps ?


[2/15/2024 4:08 PM] szybet
yep


[2/15/2024 4:09 PM] szybet
compile them ;)


[2/15/2024 4:09 PM] angus9356
Yeah can probably get to that this afternoon. Which rootfs do you guys suggest ?


[2/15/2024 4:09 PM] andi15701
well, to know that you are having the actual sources

{Reactions}
🥴 

[2/15/2024 4:10 PM] andi15701
some stone-age busybox


[2/15/2024 4:10 PM] szybet
we have an initrd there


[2/15/2024 4:10 PM] andi15701
or alpine


[2/15/2024 4:10 PM] szybet
yea


[2/15/2024 4:10 PM] szybet
probably just integrate it into inkbox build process


[2/15/2024 4:11 PM] angus9356
Thats what I was going to start with but based on which device ?


[2/15/2024 4:11 PM] szybet
all of them are similar


[2/15/2024 4:11 PM] szybet
nothing on edge


[2/15/2024 4:11 PM] szybet
for an example look for a device that uses a similar old kernel


[2/15/2024 4:12 PM] angus9356
Ok I downloaded the 905 image as it used the same kernel


[2/15/2024 4:13 PM] szybet

there are basic scripts


[2/15/2024 4:13 PM] szybet
eassly to modify them


[2/15/2024 4:30 PM] angus9356
Yeah I was looking at those last night. Thanks


[2/15/2024 6:29 PM] andi15701
do you have dmesg output of the original system?


[2/15/2024 7:02 PM] angus9356
@andi I shared a capture last night


[2/15/2024 7:09 PM] andi15701
I see only a serial console log


[2/15/2024 7:09 PM] andi15701
and the kobo kernels are often booted with the "quiet" parameter


[2/15/2024 7:09 PM] andi15701
often forcefully added by u-boot


[2/15/2024 7:12 PM] tux_linux
yea


[2/15/2024 7:15 PM] angus9356
Sorry missed the dmesg


[2/15/2024 7:15 PM] andi15701
I once ended up renaming the parameter


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
lmao


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
its that bad


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] andi15701
in the kernel


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
yea


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] angus9356
What are the login creds going to be


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
root


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
and probably nothing


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] angus9356
Ok


[2/15/2024 7:16 PM] tux_linux
yes, it's that open


[2/15/2024 7:17 PM] angus9356
There's no fw_setenv ?


[2/15/2024 7:17 PM] tux_linux
if your sd card is not too much toast there is even a telnet server that starts if you type devmodeon in the search bar of the ui


[2/15/2024 7:17 PM] angus9356
Ha


[2/15/2024 8:04 PM] szybet
what


[2/15/2024 8:49 PM] tux_linux
not in inkbox


[2/15/2024 8:49 PM] tux_linux
in kobo ui


[2/15/2024 8:51 PM] szybet
on stock?


[2/15/2024 8:53 PM] tux_linux
nickel


[2/15/2024 8:55 PM] szybet
without modification?


[2/15/2024 8:57 PM] tux_linux
without


[2/15/2024 8:57 PM] tux_linux
its that bad


[2/15/2024 8:57 PM] tux_linux
or that good


[2/15/2024 8:57 PM] tux_linux
depends on how you see it


[2/15/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
its excellent


[2/15/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
love it


[2/15/2024 9:02 PM] angus9356
dmesg is wrapping because of all of the mmc errors so I'm going to try moving the image to a new sd , fix the filesystem and then boot the new card


[2/15/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
you could try recompiling the stock kernel


[2/15/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
and forcing arguments


[2/15/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE


[2/15/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
in config


[2/15/2024 9:03 PM] tux_linux
and remove `quiet`from it


[2/15/2024 9:04 PM] tux_linux
to see the current cmdline and copy it just `cat /proc/cmdline`


[2/15/2024 9:04 PM] tux_linux
but i think you know that already


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] andi15701
or just hex-edit the bootloader


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
that too


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] andi15701
so replace quiet by quitt


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] andi15701
CONFIG_CMLINE_FORCE is bad


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] andi15701
here


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] andi15701
because there is so many useful stuff added


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] andi15701
like all the addresses


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] tux_linux
in inkbox we keep the addresses


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] tux_linux
its just that i didnt want to mess with the u-boot env


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] tux_linux
also i was 15yo


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] tux_linux
so some decisions had to be made


[2/15/2024 9:49 PM] andi15701
well, if carefully copy over stuff from /proc/cmdline of a running kernel


[2/15/2024 9:50 PM] andi15701
of course, it possible to do CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE


[2/15/2024 9:51 PM] tux_linux
this is what i did for every device


[2/16/2024 12:16 AM] angus9356
Here's the dmesg

or not


[2/16/2024 2:33 AM] angus9356
I used the u-boot script. That's what failed


[2/16/2024 2:42 AM] tux_linux
Well all those things that error seem to be useless
So maybe you can try removing them

[2/16/2024 12:44 PM] tux_linux
there is a tarball of it there


[2/16/2024 3:27 PM] angus9356
I used the toolchain that was included in your kernel repo


[2/16/2024 3:29 PM] angus9356
On a fresh checkout can you build you n905b u-boot using the arm-kobo-linux-gnueabihf that you include in the repo ?


[2/16/2024 3:30 PM] tux_linux
you probably need to use arm-linux-gnueabihf


[2/16/2024 3:30 PM] tux_linux
not arm-kobo-linux-gnueabihf


[2/16/2024 3:30 PM] tux_linux
there is a huge difference between them


[2/16/2024 3:31 PM] angus9356
Ok I did start with that. I assumed that what was in the repo was for the code that was there. I will go back and try again


[2/16/2024 3:31 PM] tux_linux
Ok, then it's strange
But I have no experience with the aura h2o u-boot


[2/16/2024 3:32 PM] angus9356
This is the n905b u-boot that is in the repo no changes


[2/16/2024 3:33 PM] tux_linux
strange


[2/16/2024 3:33 PM] tux_linux
i will see later today


[2/16/2024 3:34 PM] tux_linux
maybe you can try aura u-boot


[2/16/2024 3:35 PM] angus9356
I wanted to start with one of your working targets and modify that


[2/16/2024 3:35 PM] angus9356
I'll try on of the other compilers thats included


[2/16/2024 3:37 PM] angus9356
Ok the 4.4 from the kernel repo will compile it


[2/16/2024 3:39 PM] tux_linux
good


[2/16/2024 7:10 PM] andi15701
btw: the road to a more mainline u-boot would probably be to copy the dcd stuff over and take the aura devicetree from the kernel

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/16/2024 7:12 PM] andi15701
so  is there a mc13892 on the board?


[2/16/2024 7:13 PM] tux_linux
most probably


[2/16/2024 7:13 PM] tux_linux
mc13892 are everywhere in these old kobos


[2/16/2024 7:14 PM] andi15701
that one next to the battery connector?


[2/16/2024 7:14 PM] tux_linux
if you look in the kernel source there are sometimes dmesg messages about it


[2/16/2024 7:14 PM] andi15701
well, or that is fake


[2/16/2024 7:15 PM] andi15701
they kind of emulated that thing partly even if in reality it is a rc5t619


[2/16/2024 7:19 PM] tux_linux
Classic ntx hackery


[2/16/2024 7:19 PM] tux_linux
They are always in a hurry it seems


[2/17/2024 8:14 PM] angus9356
So the inkbox imx508 u-boot does not boot the N250


[2/17/2024 8:15 PM] tux_linux
why did you take the mx508


[2/17/2024 8:15 PM] tux_linux
i think your chip is mx507


[2/17/2024 8:15 PM] tux_linux
=n905c uboot


[2/17/2024 8:15 PM] tux_linux
in theory


[2/17/2024 8:15 PM] angus9356
The kobo u-boot build with gcc 4.4 does boot the kobo and also loads the inkbox n905b kernel


[2/17/2024 8:16 PM] angus9356
I think I chose the 905b


[2/17/2024 8:16 PM] tux_linux
but what boots and does not boot your kobo?


[2/17/2024 8:16 PM] tux_linux
what does "kobo u-boot build" mean


[2/17/2024 8:16 PM] angus9356
the kobo u-boot boots and loads the kernel but the inkbox kernel fails


[2/17/2024 8:17 PM] angus9356
This is the u-boot I got to boot. And it is indeed the imx507 so I'll try the other inkbox u-boot

yes, this should boot


[2/17/2024 8:18 PM] tux_linux
as for the kernel, i think it is expected


[2/17/2024 8:18 PM] tux_linux
probably that taking the proper sources will help


[2/17/2024 8:18 PM] angus9356
Yes I didn't think it would just wok out of the box 🙂

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/17/2024 8:18 PM] tux_linux
the ones from the kobo repo


[2/17/2024 8:19 PM] tux_linux
i suggest you keep that working aura h2o uboot


[2/17/2024 8:19 PM] tux_linux
and we can build on it


[2/17/2024 8:19 PM] tux_linux
now try to boot a working kernel from the aura h2o sources


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] tux_linux
and we can also tweak it for inkbox later


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] tux_linux
maybe just getting it to panic on boot will be a good start


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] angus9356
There's almost no difference between that and the u-boot you have in tree. I was a little surprised I got nothing from the inkbox u-boot


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] tux_linux
just to know that it actually does something


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] tux_linux
I would still take the provided u-boot if i was porting a new device
You never know... 😉


[2/17/2024 8:28 PM] angus9356
imx507 inkbox u-boot does nothing


[2/17/2024 8:30 PM] andi15701
well, what is critical is the DCD section


[2/17/2024 8:30 PM] andi15701
if you see nothing


[2/17/2024 8:30 PM] angus9356
Ok


[2/17/2024 8:30 PM] andi15701
another pitfall


[2/17/2024 8:30 PM] angus9356
what/where is the dcd section ?


[2/17/2024 8:31 PM] andi15701
some u-boot builds prepare the image in such a way that you could do cat u-boot.bin >/dev/mmcblk0


[2/17/2024 8:31 PM] andi15701
before you partition things


[2/17/2024 8:31 PM] andi15701
and some do not


[2/17/2024 8:31 PM] angus9356
I've just dd it to 1k


[2/17/2024 8:31 PM] angus9356
there's some binary junk before u-boot I didn't want to overwrite


[2/17/2024 8:32 PM] tux_linux
so we probably need to work with the kobo u-boot


[2/17/2024 8:32 PM] andi15701
you find something named imximage.cfg


[2/17/2024 8:32 PM] andi15701
in uboot sources


[2/17/2024 8:32 PM] andi15701
that is also for configuring RAM


[2/17/2024 8:33 PM] andi15701
so that means I think "device configuration data"


[2/17/2024 8:34 PM] andi15701
it ends up in the beginning of the u-boot image


[2/17/2024 8:34 PM] andi15701
(if there is not 1K of zeros prepended)


[2/17/2024 8:34 PM] andi15701
check that there are no zeros at the beginning of the u-boot


[2/17/2024 8:35 PM] andi15701
extracting that would be the main step towards using some more recent u-boot


[2/17/2024 8:35 PM] angus9356
U-boot is all zeros but the SD card has stuff in there


[2/17/2024 8:36 PM] andi15701
all zeros or just the 1st 1K


[2/17/2024 8:37 PM] angus9356
All zeros for the first 1K of u-boot.bin


[2/17/2024 8:38 PM] andi15701
do you have u-boot.imx?


[2/17/2024 8:38 PM] andi15701
or only .bin


[2/17/2024 8:38 PM] andi15701
if all zeros for the first 1K, you need to do dd if=u-boot.bin bs=1024 seek=1 skip=1 of=/dev/sdX


[2/17/2024 8:39 PM] andi15701
to install it


[2/17/2024 8:39 PM] andi15701
or just cat u-boot.bin >/dev/sdX and then partition


[2/17/2024 8:41 PM] andi15701
the dcd block starts with D1


[2/17/2024 8:41 PM] andi15701
and that D1 has to be at offset 1024 bytes of the sd card


[2/17/2024 8:58 PM] angus9356
I've been using dd


[2/17/2024 9:17 PM] angus9356
There's 2400 lines difference between the inkbox board/freescale/mx50_rdp and most of those are significant


[2/17/2024 9:37 PM] angus9356
Where does the uImage sit on the sd card ?


[2/17/2024 9:39 PM] tux_linux
on the default kobo system i think it's at ```dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 skip=2048```


[2/17/2024 9:39 PM] angus9356
This on the inkbox image


[2/17/2024 9:39 PM] tux_linux
on inkbox it's at
```dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 skip=81920```


[2/17/2024 9:40 PM] tux_linux
the inkbox kernel is bigger so it couldnt fit before first partition


[2/17/2024 9:40 PM] tux_linux
i moved it between 2 partitions


[2/17/2024 9:40 PM] tux_linux
in a 20m unpartitioned space

ntx_comm.c:#define KERNEL_OFFSET             2048


[2/17/2024 9:41 PM] tux_linux
yes, our uboot is modified


[2/17/2024 9:41 PM] andi15701
yes, I know


[2/17/2024 9:41 PM] andi15701
but that is the source


[2/17/2024 9:41 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/17/2024 9:42 PM] andi15701
the point is that kobo u-boots heavily patch the bootm command


[2/17/2024 9:42 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[2/17/2024 9:42 PM] andi15701
to load things from some defaults


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] andi15701
never played around with kobo imx5 u-boots but generally you can use fastboot to test something


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] tux_linux
you cant


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] tux_linux
its borked


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] andi15701
on imx6 kernel I always managed to boot something


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] andi15701
with it


[2/17/2024 9:43 PM] tux_linux
yes

Guys, let me intervene for a moment: Any reason for anything for unix socket to split messages for 4.6Mb?


[2/17/2024 9:49 PM] tux_linux
What


[2/17/2024 9:49 PM] tux_linux
Out of the blue, 32bit system?


[2/17/2024 9:49 PM] szybet
in rust i send this message and qt splits it up for no reason


[2/17/2024 9:49 PM] tux_linux
I think I have no idea what I'm talking about


[2/17/2024 9:49 PM] szybet
at least that's what i see

What's the practical limit on the size of single packet transmitted...
Let us assume that there is a Unix domain socket created for a typical server-client program. The client sends a 10GB buffer over the socket and it is consumed by the server in the meanwhile.

i quess qt is dumb


[2/17/2024 10:20 PM] andi15701
btw: does your device show up as usb device *without* sd card?


[2/18/2024 12:05 AM] angus9356
I've got serial so I can mess around in u-boot


[2/18/2024 12:06 AM] tux_linux
Good


[2/18/2024 12:06 AM] angus9356
Yes it shows without the SD card


[2/18/2024 1:07 AM] angus9356
it needs some HW config at block 1023 ( I zeroed it )
```
MMC read: dev # 2, block # 1023, count 1 partition # 0 ... 
1 blocks read: OK
binary magic @ sector no. 1024 not found !
ISD hwconfig missing !
``


[2/18/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
interesting


[2/18/2024 1:08 AM] tux_linux
on stock os, ntx_hwconfig usually reads from that i guess


[2/18/2024 1:10 AM] angus9356
Ok I put it back kobo u-boot and kernel works but kernel crashes almost immediately


[2/18/2024 1:10 AM] tux_linux
good


[2/18/2024 1:10 AM] tux_linux
send output


[2/18/2024 1:10 AM] tux_linux
please


[2/18/2024 1:11 AM] angus9356
Here you go

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-FED08.txt


[2/18/2024 1:12 AM] tux_linux
thats a good start


[2/18/2024 1:12 AM] tux_linux
so its the stock kernel


[2/18/2024 1:12 AM] tux_linux
did you change the partition layout?


[2/18/2024 1:12 AM] angus9356
Its the kobo kernel that I built


[2/18/2024 1:13 AM] angus9356
do you have a list of dot config changes needed for inkbox ?


[2/18/2024 1:13 AM] tux_linux
but you put hwconfig back?


[2/18/2024 1:13 AM] angus9356
yes without the HW config it crashes differentl


[2/18/2024 1:13 AM] tux_linux
i would need `cat /proc/cmdline` from stock os


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] tux_linux
it shouldnt crash if everything is in place


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] tux_linux
it should just boot


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] angus9356
I'm going to stop it in u-boot and modify the rootfs


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] tux_linux
wdym


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] angus9356
huh ?


[2/18/2024 1:14 AM] tux_linux
huh for what


[2/18/2024 1:15 AM] angus9356
wdym "What do you mean" ?


[2/18/2024 1:15 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/18/2024 1:15 AM] tux_linux
what does <stop it in u-boot> mean


[2/18/2024 1:16 AM] angus9356
It's not finding the rootfs from the message so I'll stop it in u-boot and modify the kernel cmdline


[2/18/2024 1:16 AM] tux_linux
im not sure u-boot will allow you to do that


[2/18/2024 1:16 AM] tux_linux
bootm command is borked


[2/18/2024 1:16 AM] tux_linux
it sets its own kernel arguments no matter what you define in the env


[2/18/2024 1:17 AM] tux_linux
so to circumvent it, either fix u-boot somehow or enforce `CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE` in kernel config


[2/18/2024 1:17 AM] angus9356
Huh well lucky I have the source then


[2/18/2024 1:17 AM] tux_linux
you can still try
maybe your uboot is different


[2/18/2024 1:17 AM] tux_linux
but most 2009.08 uboots i have seen from kobo are the same


[2/19/2024 11:46 PM] angus9356
Do you know where this offset is stored in u-boot ?


[2/20/2024 12:02 AM] angus9356
Nevermind found it
bootloader/imx507/board/freescale/mx50_rdp/ntx_comm.c


[2/20/2024 12:32 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[2/20/2024 12:32 AM] tux_linux
So basically change it to that offset


[2/20/2024 12:32 AM] tux_linux
And then please send fdisk -l


[2/20/2024 12:32 AM] tux_linux
Of your sd card


[2/20/2024 2:00 AM] angus9356
Not at the computer right now but I sent an image so you should be able to get it from that

should save you from length calculations


[2/20/2024 5:45 PM] angus9356
I just pulled it from the u-boot log


[2/20/2024 6:13 PM] andi15701
yes, that is another source


[2/20/2024 10:37 PM] angus9356
Need the sector before as well
dd if=kobo.img of=waveform.bin bs=512 skip=14335 count=13236


[2/20/2024 11:15 PM] andi15701
depends


[2/20/2024 11:16 PM] andi15701
look at the source of that extract-kobohidden


[2/20/2024 11:16 PM] andi15701
so if you want to analyze it, you do not need


[2/20/2024 11:16 PM] andi15701
for the waveform:


[2/20/2024 11:16 PM] andi15701
if you want to load it as regular firmware


[2/20/2024 11:17 PM] andi15701
from /lib/firmware


[2/20/2024 11:17 PM] andi15701
you do not need it


[2/20/2024 11:17 PM] andi15701
if a kobo uboot should be able to read it


[2/20/2024 11:17 PM] andi15701
you need it


[2/20/2024 11:48 PM] angus9356
Without the additional sector the kobo u-boot was doing a short read


[2/20/2024 11:49 PM] andi15701
yes, it contains the length


[2/20/2024 11:49 PM] angus9356
I have u-boot working now and the kernel starts

[2/20/2024 11:52 PM] andi15701
that is about that sector


[2/20/2024 11:53 PM] andi15701
so if you want to put an extracted file back


[2/20/2024 11:53 PM] andi15701
you just need to reverse the action I have have done while reading


[2/20/2024 11:55 PM] andi15701
so now are you planing to do something on top of 6.6?


[2/20/2024 11:56 PM] andi15701
if you are a kernel contributer


[2/20/2024 11:57 PM] angus9356
First I'm going to get this thing working. Probably won't upstream it as I don't feel like completely rebuild the devicetree


[2/20/2024 11:57 PM] angus9356
I want a waterproof eink device that runs linux.


[2/20/2024 11:59 PM] andi15701
well, here the clara2e is waiting...


[2/21/2024 12:00 AM] andi15701
probably writing the devicetree is just a copy-modify-work with the imx50-kobo-aura.dts


[2/21/2024 12:01 AM] angus9356
That would be good if there is a reasonable starting place


[2/21/2024 12:01 AM] angus9356
Need to get this one going first


[2/21/2024 12:02 AM] andi15701
My impression is it is modifying the devicetree and fiddling a bit with the epdc driver to work with old chips


[2/21/2024 12:03 AM] andi15701
and if we have one imx5 device working, the others are easier and with some luck we can get rid of 2.6 kernels and the dependencies on some stone-age userspace


[2/21/2024 12:04 AM] angus9356

NtxHwCfg_GetCfgFldStrVal:[WARNING]Config version too old !! Please update config file !!
```


[2/21/2024 12:06 AM] angus9356
Not seeing anything like that now. A missing file or mmc sector ?


[2/21/2024 12:56 AM] andi15701
often seen that


[2/21/2024 12:56 AM] andi15701
without any problem associated


[2/21/2024 12:56 AM] andi15701
nothing missing


[2/21/2024 1:30 AM] angus9356
The system is crashing at the point the power management gets enabled so guessing there a regulator not properly setup


[2/22/2024 8:42 AM] andi15701
oops, misinterpreted that, so if these messages are gone, then there is something missing


[2/22/2024 8:42 AM] andi15701
again for hwconfig, you need to create the sector before the data


[2/22/2024 8:43 AM] andi15701
same as for waveform


[2/22/2024 8:43 AM] andi15701
or for simplicity, start with a clone of the pre-partition space


[2/22/2024 11:25 PM] angus9356
Add sectors 1023 and 1024 changed the message but boot still fails


[2/22/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
Which uboot do you went with in the end? The vendor one or a generic one?


[2/22/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
And kernel


[2/22/2024 11:49 PM] szybet
I dont see any changes in the repo


[2/22/2024 11:55 PM] tux_linux
there is another branch


[2/23/2024 12:19 AM] angus9356
The kobo u-boot  can boot either the kernel from the original image or the kernel that I built from the kobo sources


[2/23/2024 12:21 AM] angus9356
the kernel I built crashes around the point of enabling the network driver and power management


[2/23/2024 12:49 AM] angus9356
Ok I think I have the kernel booting now. Just something wrong with the rootfs 
can't run '/etc/init.d/rcS': No such file or directory


[2/23/2024 9:48 AM] andi15701
so, do you have the initrd stuff specified in the kernel config?


[2/23/2024 5:40 PM] angus9356
When I enable the initrd stuff in the kernel is when it crashes so maybe I need to generate the inintrd binaries with the same compiler.


[2/23/2024 5:41 PM] angus9356
How is the initrd being built ?


[2/23/2024 5:44 PM] tux_linux
you need an inkbox-type initrd

so it should be included


[2/23/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux

some things in the initrd will need to be changed


[2/23/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
like the device id, public keys, etc.

[2/23/2024 6:05 PM] tux_linux
it was manually created from a basic busybox install


[2/23/2024 6:05 PM] tux_linux
it's basically the same for each device but with small changes for device-specific stuff


[2/23/2024 6:13 PM] angus9356
Ok what commands did you use to manually generate it ?


[2/23/2024 6:38 PM] szybet
you mean the busybox?


[2/23/2024 6:59 PM] angus9356
Well the whole initrd directory or is the only binary in there busybox ?


[2/23/2024 7:22 PM] tux_linux
i will add a n250 directory later today


[2/23/2024 7:27 PM] angus9356
Ok thanks. I made a copy of the n905b dir and thats not working right now


[2/23/2024 7:29 PM] angus9356
Will you use the gcc 4.4 compiler to generate it ?


[2/23/2024 9:29 PM] szybet
is ti just busybox compiled with the crosscompiler and put into this filesystem?


[2/23/2024 9:47 PM] andi15701
btw there is support for iMX50 Kindle readers in mainline barebox... so maybe it is a starting point if the stone-age uboot gets too nasty...


[2/23/2024 9:50 PM] tux_linux
Basically yes


[2/23/2024 9:50 PM] tux_linux
And some extras


[2/23/2024 9:50 PM] szybet
yes some scripts some binaries


[2/23/2024 9:50 PM] szybet
but basic stuff


[2/23/2024 9:50 PM] tux_linux

I have some changes to push to your repo


[2/23/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
could you give me access


[2/23/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
thanks


[2/23/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
Also you will need to compile the kernel modules for that device
or i can
whatever, they need to be in modules.sqsh


[2/23/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
also, i don't think n250 kernel source is in there


[2/23/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
it should be

you can give me access first, i'll push commits, then you can add your working kernel source


[2/23/2024 10:25 PM] angus9356
I pushed up the kobo n250 kernel


[2/23/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux
where


[2/23/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux
did you give me access first


[2/23/2024 10:26 PM] tux_linux
so i can push my commit


[2/23/2024 10:26 PM] angus9356
Working on it


[2/23/2024 10:26 PM] tux_linux
ok, thanks


[2/23/2024 10:27 PM] angus9356
Here's the n250 kernel source https://github.com/nytowl/kernel/tree/n250/kernel/linux-2.6.35.3-n250

oh ok, it somehow escaped my eyes


[2/23/2024 10:27 PM] tux_linux
let me know when i can push


[2/23/2024 10:28 PM] angus9356
I'm trying to figure out how to add you


[2/23/2024 10:28 PM] tux_linux
i think it's in the repo settings


[2/23/2024 10:28 PM] tux_linux
under collaborators


[2/23/2024 10:28 PM] tux_linux
maybe


[2/23/2024 10:28 PM] angus9356
There is no settings tab after "insights"


[2/23/2024 10:29 PM] angus9356
If you push them to a branch on the main repo I can pull it from ther e

[2/23/2024 11:10 PM] tux_linux
I pushed on the main repo


[2/23/2024 11:10 PM] tux_linux
though gh actions are not relevant if you build this kernel only for this device


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] angus9356
I grabbed it thanks

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
you need to compile modules for it


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
and probably more than usual


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
like g_ether and g_mass_storage ones


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
maybe i can do it once i have time


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
also what cursed wifi chip does this kobo have


[2/23/2024 11:17 PM] tux_linux
all kobo wifi chips are cursed


[2/23/2024 11:18 PM] angus9356

[2/23/2024 11:32 PM] angus9356
I'm puzzled . The kernel boots fine until I include the initrd


[2/23/2024 11:34 PM] tux_linux
wdym?


[2/23/2024 11:37 PM] angus9356
If I build the initrd into the kernel it crashes here without any message

[2/23/2024 11:45 PM] tux_linux
compare your cmdline with this one


[2/23/2024 11:45 PM] tux_linux
i think there are some things missing


[2/23/2024 11:45 PM] tux_linux
it contains the public key for package signature verification


[2/23/2024 11:46 PM] tux_linux
and some other keys too


[2/24/2024 12:05 AM] angus9356
The cmdline was ok. Going to try booting and mounting the second SD instead of the initrd


[2/24/2024 12:08 AM] szybet
@tux-linux you have access to a fork repo if the parent repo is yours


[2/24/2024 12:13 AM] tux_linux
It kept saying permission denied


[2/24/2024 12:16 AM] szybet

[2/24/2024 12:17 AM] tux_linux

I'll figure out the initrmafs thing tomorrow


[2/24/2024 12:33 AM] tux_linux
I have a progress bar to fix


[2/24/2024 12:33 AM] tux_linux
What is the screen resolution


[2/24/2024 12:33 AM] tux_linux
Du you have a boot log also


[2/24/2024 12:35 AM] angus9356
Guessing this is the issue
Root filesystem's digital signature is invalid! Shutting down ...


[2/24/2024 12:35 AM] tux_linux
Yes
You don't have a rootfs yet


[2/24/2024 12:36 AM] angus9356
I put the n905b image on there


[2/24/2024 12:36 AM] tux_linux

[2/24/2024 2:04 PM] andi15701
?


[2/24/2024 5:16 PM] tux_linux
it's dhd.ko


[2/24/2024 5:47 PM] angus9356
I think the WDT is triggering before the initramfs can be unpacked. The bootdelay countdown is also to fast by a factor of about 10


[2/24/2024 5:47 PM] angus9356
Seen either of these before ?


[2/24/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
wdt?


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] angus9356
Watch dog timer


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
it's possible


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
try `i2c probe`


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
in u-boot cmdline


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
usually this prevents watchdog from triggering


[2/24/2024 5:52 PM] angus9356
I wondered why that was in the sources 🙂


[2/24/2024 5:56 PM] angus9356
Well now it works. That would have been good to know a couple of days ago :/

a "general porting guide" would be cool

[2/24/2024 6:12 PM] angus9356
That would have been a handy page to see. Glad you showed me before I started messing around with the signing

It's not that helpfull, maybe some commands are but yea, incomplete


[2/24/2024 6:20 PM] angus9356
Whats the difference between the std kernel and the rooted ?


[2/24/2024 6:22 PM] andi15701
it is dhd.ko is some android kernels as external module


[2/24/2024 6:23 PM] andi15701
well, I gave you the link describing the watchdog


[2/24/2024 6:23 PM] angus9356

[2/24/2024 7:19 PM] szybet
if not, then kernel

if that's so i can fix it

I think it's the 1 but how would I check ?

... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/24/2024 7:22 PM] szybet
anyway


[2/24/2024 7:23 PM] szybet
do you have access to a shell now?


[2/24/2024 7:23 PM] angus9356

no


[2/24/2024 7:24 PM] szybet
hmm


[2/24/2024 7:24 PM] szybet
first run htop then chroot and in this htop kill the current app, it should be someting oob with name in it


[2/24/2024 7:25 PM] angus9356
{oobe-inkbox} /bin/sh ./oobe-inkbox


[2/24/2024 7:26 PM] szybet
then in this chroot run `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/lib:/lib/:/usr/lib QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo:debug /mnt/kobo/.adds/inkbox/oobe-inkbox-bin`


[2/24/2024 7:26 PM] szybet
the path may be different


[2/24/2024 7:26 PM] szybet
but something like that

does `/bin/kobo_config.sh` exist in your chroot env?


[2/24/2024 7:31 PM] angus9356
yes


[2/24/2024 7:32 PM] angus9356
There's no n250 in there


[2/24/2024 7:32 PM] szybet

[2/24/2024 7:32 PM] szybet
show the file

I'm running the n905b rootfs


[2/24/2024 7:34 PM] szybet
what is /opt/inkbox_device


[2/24/2024 7:34 PM] angus9356
n250


[2/24/2024 7:34 PM] szybet
do you have your old stock os somewhere?


[2/24/2024 7:35 PM] angus9356
yep


[2/24/2024 7:35 PM] szybet
you need to retrieve a file somewhere like `/mnt/onboard/.kobo/version`


[2/24/2024 7:36 PM] szybet
here you need to add snow for n250


[2/24/2024 7:36 PM] szybet
echo "snow"


[2/24/2024 7:36 PM] angus9356
How do I make the rootfs rw


[2/24/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
.


[2/24/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
do it for n250, n250a, n250b because we dont know


[2/24/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
yet which device you have exactly


[2/24/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
upload your changes here:
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs
and here for the chroot:
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/gui-rootfs


[2/24/2024 7:39 PM] szybet
after you retrieve the version file replace the current one you have at that path and... idk to which repo to upload it


[2/24/2024 7:39 PM] tux_linux
its probably better not to


[2/24/2024 7:39 PM] tux_linux
but


[2/24/2024 7:39 PM] tux_linux
`ifsctl mnt rootfs rw`


[2/24/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
@tux-linux where to put the version file per device


[2/24/2024 7:41 PM] tux_linux
??


[2/24/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
/mnt/onboard/.kobo/version


[2/24/2024 7:41 PM] angus9356
well now it knows the device type
```

[2/24/2024 7:42 PM] szybet
340 it is


[2/24/2024 7:42 PM] szybet
or you didnt updated the file yet, right?


[2/24/2024 7:42 PM] tux_linux
i still dont understand your question


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet
the file is device specific


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] angus9356
I updated the kobo_config.sh


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet
where to put it in which repo to make it work


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] tux_linux
its auto generated


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet
like does imgtool replace it or what


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet
what


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet
how


[2/24/2024 7:43 PM] szybet

also we need to add n250 there


[2/24/2024 7:46 PM] angus9356
from the original device ?


[2/24/2024 7:46 PM] szybet
we did it already, read the chat

Where is it on the SD card ?

[2/24/2024 7:46 PM] szybet
probably last partition at the same path?


[2/24/2024 7:46 PM] tux_linux
dont leave changes hanging around like that


[2/24/2024 7:46 PM] szybet
mount every partition and just search for it


[2/24/2024 7:49 PM] angus9356
There is no /mnt/onboard/.kobo


[2/24/2024 7:49 PM] angus9356
That is one of the directories that was trashed on the SD card


[2/24/2024 7:49 PM] tux_linux
`/kobo/mnt/onboard/.kobo`


[2/24/2024 7:49 PM] tux_linux

My original kobo sd card was trashed

ok whatever


[2/24/2024 7:51 PM] szybet
we will figure it out the hard way later


[2/24/2024 7:51 PM] szybet
now please wait so i can figure out why there are no logs regarding input


[2/24/2024 7:51 PM] angus9356
is there somewhere else it is stored ?


[2/24/2024 7:51 PM] tux_linux
maybe we can ask some guy at mr for an image


[2/24/2024 7:51 PM] szybet
we dont need it


[2/24/2024 7:52 PM] szybet
if the x axis will be inverted then its the second one


[2/24/2024 7:52 PM] tux_linux
in your recovery partition
probably


[2/24/2024 7:53 PM] angus9356
there is no /mnt/onboard in the recovery part


[2/24/2024 7:54 PM] szybet
forget about it


[2/24/2024 7:54 PM] tux_linux
there should be an archive somewhere with original rootfs


[2/24/2024 7:54 PM] tux_linux
but maybe you dont need it


[2/24/2024 7:54 PM] angus9356
ok


[2/24/2024 7:55 PM] szybet
to the launch command add those env vars: `QT_LOGGING_RULES=qt.qpa.input=true QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1`

[2/24/2024 8:09 PM] szybet
in the meantime you look up ( not in the chroot ) the /usr/local/bin/wifi directory


[2/24/2024 8:09 PM] szybet
or update the things you changed till now to our repos


[2/24/2024 8:11 PM] angus9356
I've added all of the kernel and u-boot changes to my branch


[2/24/2024 8:11 PM] angus9356
The only other change I made was the script change you asked for


[2/24/2024 8:11 PM] szybet
yes, open a pull request in the gui rootfs repo


[2/24/2024 8:13 PM] angus9356

counter clockwise


[2/24/2024 8:17 PM] szybet
the other 2 idk


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] angus9356
upside down ?


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] angus9356
counter clock wise


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] szybet
then what UR is


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] angus9356
Upper right ??


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] szybet
this doesnt make sense


[2/24/2024 8:18 PM] angus9356
upside right ?


[2/24/2024 8:19 PM] szybet
ugh... then which one would be 0 degrees?


[2/24/2024 8:19 PM] angus9356
UR


[2/24/2024 8:19 PM] szybet
upside right sound like 180


[2/24/2024 8:20 PM] angus9356
No that would be upside down


[2/24/2024 8:20 PM] angus9356
upside right = upside correct

[2/24/2024 8:20 PM] szybet

mess


[2/24/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
@Angus those top left top right are for the how the app is rotated or how the device is rotated normally ( default state )?


[2/24/2024 8:55 PM] szybet
try these commands:
```

forward button is actually in bottom right, which doesnt help


[2/24/2024 9:18 PM] angus9356
That was the device orientation


[2/24/2024 9:19 PM] angus9356
For me the forward button was bottom left of the device. The gui was displaying in landscape mode


[2/24/2024 9:20 PM] angus9356
For the display to be the correct portrait orientation would have been 90 CCW rotation


[2/24/2024 9:21 PM] szybet
hmmm okay


[2/24/2024 9:21 PM] szybet
try those commands anyway


[2/24/2024 9:21 PM] szybet
one of these should make touch working


[2/24/2024 9:31 PM] angus9356
Ok I might get a chance later today otherwise tomorrow am


[2/24/2024 9:31 PM] angus9356
Are there screen rotation commands as well ?


[2/24/2024 9:57 PM] tux_linux
`echo {0,1,2,3} > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate`


[2/24/2024 10:00 PM] angus9356
The sleeping message comes up in the devices original orientation


[2/24/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
oh no


[2/24/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
thats not the solution for now


[2/24/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
so... the input for qt is correct but the UI is wrong


[2/24/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
right?


[2/24/2024 10:10 PM] szybet
by 90 degrees to the... right, because the bigger bezzel should be on the bottom


[2/24/2024 10:10 PM] szybet
so it's now in clockwise


[2/24/2024 10:10 PM] szybet
please correct me if im wrong


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] angus9356
This is what I did to get the correct orientation on the GUI
```
inkbox:/# echo 3 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate
[   49.984752] epdfbdc_set_width_height(1439): new DCSize(3342336)>original DCSize(3317760) !
inkbox:/# cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate 
1
```


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] szybet
but then input was wrong?


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] angus9356
Not sure trying the inputs now


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] szybet
what? why is it 1 if you set it to 3


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] angus9356
shrug


[2/24/2024 10:11 PM] szybet
this must work


[2/24/2024 10:12 PM] angus9356
With  the screen rotated it looks like the touchscreen is the correct orientation


[2/24/2024 10:13 PM] szybet
so it works now?


[2/24/2024 10:13 PM] angus9356
The arrow goes black when I touch it but nothing else happens


[2/24/2024 10:13 PM] szybet
click it, not hold it?


[2/24/2024 10:14 PM] angus9356
just clicking it


[2/24/2024 10:14 PM] angus9356
goes black


[2/24/2024 10:14 PM] szybet
and back to white?


[2/24/2024 10:14 PM] angus9356
no to get it to go back to white I need to click the back arrow


[2/24/2024 10:15 PM] szybet
?????????????????????


[2/24/2024 10:15 PM] szybet
fuck it, launch inkbox-bin instead of oobe-bin


[2/24/2024 10:15 PM] szybet
the same directory


[2/24/2024 10:15 PM] szybet
maybe it will launch, if not i need to look up some env variables


[2/24/2024 10:17 PM] angus9356
It doesn't crash but it also doesn't change the display


[2/24/2024 10:17 PM] szybet
nothing happens?


[2/24/2024 10:17 PM] angus9356
I get logging output on the terminal but nothing on the screen


[2/24/2024 10:17 PM] szybet
launch inkbox.sh then


[2/24/2024 10:18 PM] angus9356
The dispaly blinked but still just shows welcome


[2/24/2024 10:18 PM] szybet
launch 2048


[2/24/2024 10:18 PM] szybet
a game


[2/24/2024 10:18 PM] szybet
there


[2/24/2024 10:19 PM] angus9356
oh inkbox does something different from inkbox-bin


[2/24/2024 10:19 PM] angus9356

So maybe this has something to do with the timer issue I was seeing in u-boot.


[2/24/2024 10:23 PM] angus9356
The bootdelay countdown counts 10x faster than it should


[2/24/2024 10:24 PM] angus9356
2048 doesn't work either


[2/24/2024 10:24 PM] .kitkat1.
ignore the account change
it should still work if you click it, hold it, still hold it in the same position and then release


[2/24/2024 10:25 PM] angus9356
It does not click. It won't even change colour now

[2/24/2024 10:28 PM] .kitkat1.
does an event appear when you release


[2/24/2024 10:28 PM] .kitkat1.

@Angus new plan, in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/`  is somewhere plugins directory and in it platforms directory and in in libkobo.so
unmount libkobo.so and then mount the libkobo.so i sended you and try out 2048 app if something changed

[2/26/2024 6:16 PM] angus9356
Would it be possible that you provide the updated qt.isa and then I just mount that libkobo.so into it ?

copying those libs directly is easier

[2/29/2024 8:48 PM] angus9356
ok so `umount /mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/kobo.so` Or just never mount it there.


[2/29/2024 8:49 PM] angus9356
Does it need to bind mounted at `/lib/qt-bin/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/` or can I just copy it there ?


[2/29/2024 8:57 PM] szybet
its a replacament for /mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/plugins/platforms/libkobo.so

so put it to /lib/qt-bin/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/plugins/platforms/

@Szybet Ok the sensitive area on the touchscreen for the button looks about right and seems to work . The image is inverted however


[2/29/2024 10:01 PM] angus9356
the inkbox GUI works as well but it is also inverted


[2/29/2024 10:02 PM] szybet
so touch works?


[2/29/2024 10:02 PM] szybet
now?


[2/29/2024 10:03 PM] angus9356
I think so. I had to guess at the button locations because of the inverted screen. Tocuhes did seem to register in the GUI


[2/29/2024 10:05 PM] szybet
oh god


[2/29/2024 10:05 PM] szybet
this will be a lot of work to merge

try the arguments for inverting touch i gived you


[2/29/2024 10:06 PM] szybet
they may not work anymore tho


[2/29/2024 10:19 PM] angus9356
Are there args for inverting the gui instead ? The buttons are the correct orientation for the device

It may have some more env


[2/29/2024 10:30 PM] szybet

[3/1/2024 7:21 PM] szybet

via the old platform plugin, not the experimental one


[3/1/2024 7:26 PM] angus9356
I did manage to rotate it with the old plugin


[3/1/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
good, at least that


[3/1/2024 7:44 PM] szybet
@NiLuJe how is default rotation determined?


[3/1/2024 7:45 PM] szybet
@Angus could you run ( not inside the chroot ) fbink command with some arguments and debug options to see it's output?


[3/1/2024 7:50 PM] angus9356
Sure post them I'll try to do them this afternoon. I'm going to be AFK from March 2-10th


[3/1/2024 7:59 PM] szybet
maybe in this time i will have time to merge the plugin together


[3/1/2024 7:59 PM] szybet
we will see


[3/1/2024 9:31 PM] ninuje
In which context?


[3/1/2024 9:32 PM] ninuje
The default is the system default, unless you ask FBInk for something in particular, nothing happens on Kobo on that front.


[3/1/2024 9:32 PM] szybet
default default


[3/1/2024 9:33 PM] szybet
well inkbox fault then


[3/1/2024 9:33 PM] ninuje
(or, more exactly, whatever the state it's in whenever you get to it. Stock systems will apply up to three different fb modes: boot (i.e., true native/default), pickel (i.e., the boot anim), then nickel (i.e., Portrait)


[3/1/2024 9:34 PM] ninuje
We use fbdepth to enforce UR on startup in KOReader, you can do that or use fbink_set_fb_info directly on startup


[3/1/2024 9:35 PM] ninuje
Special mention about the H2O: It has a native viewport (11 top pixels are behind the bezel), so this needs some specific handling in the frontend


[3/1/2024 9:35 PM] ninuje
You can compute it from stuff exported in FBInkState, but the maths is a little bit funky, I don't have an example on hand


[3/1/2024 9:36 PM] ninuje
In any case, those 11 top pixels are not dead, just invisible, and the kernel doesn't screw with you on that front (i.e., (0, 0) is a valid pixel & touch coordinate, it's just physically invisible and impossible to touch ;p)


[3/1/2024 9:37 PM] szybet
they stole 11 pixel from us


[3/1/2024 9:37 PM] szybet
@tux-linux when is initial rotation set


[3/1/2024 10:10 PM] tux_linux
I think in usr bin inkbox.sh


[3/1/2024 10:11 PM] szybet
okay


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] angus9356
So using fbink_set_fb_info I should be able to set the correct rotation ?


[3/1/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
nope

but nope, leave these things to me


[3/1/2024 11:12 PM] angus9356
Until you get your stuff ready I just want to add something to inkox.sh so it's the right orientation and I can use it


[3/1/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
oh its just set via sys class graphics fb0 rotate


[3/1/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
but input rotation will change too


[3/1/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
well you can focus on wifi, usbnet for now


[3/1/2024 11:13 PM] angus9356
That didn't seem to affect the new libkobo


[3/1/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
also you won't be able to affect the file, its not editable


[3/1/2024 11:13 PM] angus9356
usbnet is working


[3/1/2024 11:14 PM] szybet
idk what mess you are in now but it depends which plugin you use and which command, inkbox.sh overwrites it probably inside


[3/1/2024 11:14 PM] angus9356
I edited most of the scripts to use the new bins you pointed me at


[3/1/2024 11:15 PM] angus9356
It boots up to inkbox but upside down


[3/1/2024 11:16 PM] szybet
idk how rotation works for the experimental plugin


[3/1/2024 11:16 PM] szybet
no

Oh, there's your problem.


[3/2/2024 12:17 AM] ninuje
Don't do that. (on ntx kernels, at least)


[3/2/2024 12:17 AM] ninuje
54% of the NTX kernels will screw that up.

Use fbdepth or fbink_set_fb_info, it'll bludgeon the stupid kernels into submission (at great pain).

As for the input translation, you can get the swap/mirror flags from current FBInk (it's not in a release yet), e.g., https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk/blob/07aee7beb7505abba9e8dbc7ec482d444884dd09/utils/finger_trace.c#L513-L539

viewport == vert_origin - vert_offset


[3/2/2024 6:20 PM] ninuje
11 = 18 - 7 on a H2O, for instance


[3/2/2024 6:20 PM] ninuje
FBInk enforces the viewport for every in-FBInk draw operations (including region dumps), unless you init with no_viewport set in the config

```
    -r, --rota <-1|0|1|2|3>         Switch the framebuffer to the supplied rotation. -1 is a magic value matching the device-specific Portrait orientation.

did you strip it


[3/9/2024 6:20 PM] szybet
you can run this binary inside gui rootfs with 
```
/mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/system/lib/ld-musl-armhf.so.1 /external_root/fbdepth
```
and adjust your rotation with it instead


[3/9/2024 6:20 PM] szybet
when you match rotation with it and the touch rotation in the new platform plugin i can adjust the rest later


[3/9/2024 6:20 PM] szybet
its not final anyway


[3/9/2024 11:13 PM] ninuje
FWIW, the `-R <UR|CW|CCW|UD>` syntax is preferred ( `-r -1` *should* match `-R UR`, but it's computed via legacy nastiness that might go poof one day, or just end up doing the wrong thing on theoretical future devices)


[3/9/2024 11:14 PM] ninuje
(If something like that is ever implemented on other devices, that's also something that will only work via -R and not -r -1)


[3/9/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
i just like the -1


[3/9/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
it avoid mess in the shell script


[3/9/2024 11:15 PM] ninuje
Even in terms of "right now" portability, -1 is only implemented on Kobo/Cervantes builds


[3/9/2024 11:16 PM] szybet
hmm, is from what you were talking UR is not always the default? ( like nickel boots... )


[3/9/2024 11:16 PM] ninuje
If you just have a thing against strings, `-R 0` == `-R UR` 😉


[3/9/2024 11:18 PM] ninuje
Yeah, it's almost never the boot rotation (the exception being the Libra ~~2~~ [OG Libra, actually]). On recent enough FW, it's what *should* be the Portrait Nickel rotation, though.


[3/9/2024 11:18 PM] ninuje
(i.e., buttons on the right for asymetric devices)


[3/9/2024 11:20 PM] szybet
So i will stick to -1 because it's that rotation ( default one? )


[3/9/2024 11:20 PM] ninuje
On that note, `-R` is *also* only implemented on Kobo currently ;p. (But it's the future-proof approach, there's a fairly large chance I'll kill the -1 codepath Soon(TM))


[3/9/2024 11:21 PM] szybet
ugh, so what do i do


[3/9/2024 11:21 PM] ninuje
`-R UR` == `-R 0`


[3/9/2024 11:21 PM] ninuje
== `-r -1`


[3/9/2024 11:21 PM] szybet
but its not the default always


[3/9/2024 11:22 PM] ninuje
It's what we as third-party apps should use by default, but it's rarely if ever the state we get from the device without manual intervention. hence this tool ;p


[3/9/2024 11:24 PM] szybet
what a mess
