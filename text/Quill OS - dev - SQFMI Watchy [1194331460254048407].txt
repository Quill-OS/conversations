@Szybet @Kuratius 
I suggest we move Watchy discussion here, as it will eventually be related in some way to InkBox

Rutgers University Confirmed: Meshtastic and LoRa are dangerous
In 2020, I was the first YouTuber to make a video about “Meshtastic,” created by Kevin Hester. The project name was a merge between Mesh and Fantastic. Already then, I loved the project. But why is it the “most dangerous LoRa project”? Here is the proof: My video was included in a study titled “NETWORK-ENABLED ANARCHY” by an organization feature...

[1/9/2024 6:27 PM] kuratius
could be interesting for watchy integration


[1/9/2024 6:27 PM] tux_linux
what is it exactly


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] kuratius
basically decentralized long range text messaging that works without cell towers


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] tux_linux
awesome


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] kuratius
a few km in range


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] tux_linux
like amateur radio a bit


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] kuratius
yeah


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] szybet
lora? is it long range esp something?


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] kuratius
it's a communication protocol iirc


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] kuratius
very interference resistant but slow


[1/9/2024 6:28 PM] szybet
can you send me a esp32 doc for this?


[1/9/2024 6:29 PM] kuratius
you need an extra chip or an esp32 with it anyway but, sec

[1/9/2024 6:29 PM] kuratius
for example


[1/9/2024 6:30 PM] kuratius
you'd probably put it in your pocket and it'd send updates to your watch


[1/9/2024 6:30 PM] kuratius
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005692235592.html?aff_fcid=1809019a26e34897b0a0717635f1ef87-1704821424168-08556-_Dk8N1TV&tt=CPS_NORMAL&aff_fsk=_Dk8N1TV&aff_platform=shareComponent-detail&sk=_Dk8N1TV&aff_trace_key=1809019a26e34897b0a0717635f1ef87-1704821424168-08556-_Dk8N1TV&terminal_id=da8e8c59ffb0402b84e7be1a6904d0ef&afSmartRedirect=y similar


[1/9/2024 6:31 PM] kuratius
there are message forwarding protocols for it


[1/9/2024 6:31 PM] kuratius
so you can have a group chat spanning multiple cities


[1/9/2024 6:31 PM] tux_linux
seems nice


[1/9/2024 6:34 PM] kuratius
iirc it was originally intended for offgrid countries with bad cell connections but it can be used for emergency communications


[1/9/2024 6:34 PM] tux_linux
probably illegal here


[1/9/2024 6:34 PM] tux_linux
we have extremely strict amateur radio standards in canada


[1/9/2024 6:34 PM] kuratius
or for text messaging without government censorship


[1/9/2024 6:34 PM] kuratius
depends on the chip you buy


[1/9/2024 6:35 PM] kuratius
iirc they have versions that use an unlicensed band appropriate for most countries

👍 

[1/9/2024 6:35 PM] kuratius
I know for sure the US and Germany have versions


[1/9/2024 6:35 PM] tux_linux
cool


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] tux_linux
maybe it could be used to transmit 512kbps internet via pocsag1200


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] kuratius
maybe, yeah

over audio cables


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] tux_linux
it was hilarious


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] tux_linux
but very cool


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] kuratius
it's very slow though, so beyond text messaging it's not that useful


[1/9/2024 6:36 PM] kuratius
good thing is the low power and high range

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/9/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
if you are looking at something like that


[1/9/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
esp has espnow which also has impressive range


[1/9/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
i already tinkered with it, cool protocol


[1/9/2024 6:40 PM] kuratius
is it multiple km?


[1/9/2024 6:40 PM] kuratius
5-16km lora


[1/9/2024 6:40 PM] tux_linux
ive always searched for a way to have mobile data without a sim


[1/9/2024 6:40 PM] kuratius
~250m espnow


[1/9/2024 6:40 PM] tux_linux
at some point i was sending webpages over sms


[1/9/2024 6:41 PM] tux_linux
it worked so-so


[1/9/2024 6:41 PM] tux_linux
they were split in base64


[1/9/2024 6:41 PM] tux_linux
html


[1/9/2024 6:42 PM] kuratius
other than that, I guess you could provide an access point for games that require wifi for LAN play I guess?


[1/9/2024 6:42 PM] kuratius
from the watchy I mean

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

apparently this exists lol


[1/9/2024 7:06 PM] kuratius
only issue is that it has bad battery life compared to the watchy


[1/9/2024 7:06 PM] kuratius
probably due to the display

[1/9/2024 7:09 PM] kuratius
would be curious if it can be added to the watchy in a custom case


[1/9/2024 7:10 PM] kuratius
probably not without a lot of work

I guess you could use espnow to connect to a lora device nearby

👍 

[1/9/2024 7:23 PM] kuratius
that could be a good compromise

oooh


[1/9/2024 7:24 PM] kuratius
I  figured out why it's so expensive


[1/9/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius
it's the thing where sellers make the last few items too expensive instead of confessing that they're out of stock


[1/9/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius
for search engine optimization


[1/9/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius

what do you plan to do with the watchy?


[1/9/2024 9:11 PM] kuratius
maybe see if I can get it to display lora messages


[1/9/2024 9:11 PM] kuratius
beyond that idk


[1/9/2024 9:11 PM] kuratius
if there is a way to hack the driver to get greyscale, maybe that


[1/9/2024 9:13 PM] kuratius
is there a matrix client that runs on esps?


[1/9/2024 9:16 PM] kuratius
maybe help you if there's low hanging fruit or something where I can do math lol


[1/9/2024 9:17 PM] kuratius
also is it hard to get an app to communicate over bluetooth?


[1/9/2024 9:17 PM] kuratius
or wifi for that matter

dithering

via usb...

disconnect the battery


[1/9/2024 10:04 PM] szybet
with a wooden something


[1/9/2024 10:04 PM] kuratius
alternatively I could figure out how to actually do the ota update


[1/9/2024 10:05 PM] kuratius
the instructions just said to go to the website but it doesnt work lol

[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] szybet
can you read the readme?


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] szybet
thanks


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] kuratius
I called the script


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] kuratius
still doesnt find the header


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] szybet
read the output


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] szybet
you are missing some commands


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] kuratius
pio is supposed to get the packages automatically


[1/10/2024 5:16 PM] szybet
its my external script


[1/10/2024 5:17 PM] szybet
it creates the header file from ground up


[1/10/2024 5:17 PM] kuratius
so it's missing folders ?


[1/10/2024 5:17 PM] szybet
no


[1/10/2024 5:17 PM] szybet
stop assuming things


[1/10/2024 5:18 PM] szybet

mine is

[1/10/2024 5:22 PM] szybet
install it


[1/10/2024 5:22 PM] szybet
or dont use debian


[1/10/2024 5:23 PM] szybet
i will update the readme with your problems...


[1/10/2024 5:34 PM] szybet
pull the repo for changes


[1/10/2024 5:34 PM] szybet
i updated a few things


[1/10/2024 5:41 PM] kuratius
It's a bit tricky to install xxd


[1/10/2024 5:41 PM] kuratius
can I just adjust your script to work with the older version?


[1/10/2024 5:41 PM] kuratius
there's multiple sources for xxd and I'd probably have to update vim etc etc


[1/10/2024 5:41 PM] kuratius
dont want to mess up everything


[1/10/2024 5:42 PM] szybet
paru -S xxd-standalone

via aur


[1/10/2024 5:43 PM] szybet
i doubt you will be able


[1/10/2024 5:43 PM] szybet
i also use specific xxd features in vault


[1/10/2024 5:43 PM] szybet
you can look there at the source its getting it from


[1/10/2024 5:43 PM] tux_linux
maybe you can try busybox xxd?


[1/10/2024 5:43 PM] tux_linux
or maybe it won't have some options you want


[1/10/2024 5:44 PM] tux_linux
```

I cant install this without uinstalling vim I think


[1/10/2024 5:50 PM] kuratius
but building works


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
why do you need to uninstall vim


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
`make install` doesn't work?


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] kuratius
xxd is a package vim depends on


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
maybe you can just change your PATH


[1/10/2024 5:51 PM] tux_linux
and not install it


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
PATH=/path/to/xxd/folder:${PATH}


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
priority


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] kuratius
tried via bash rc, my changes are lower priority than the system


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
if you put it right before the building command


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
you can try env -i to clear the environment too


[1/10/2024 5:52 PM] tux_linux
but you will probably have to add /usr/bin:/bin to your path at least


[1/10/2024 5:54 PM] szybet
install arch


[1/10/2024 5:54 PM] tux_linux
if you want you can setup a qemu vm with a preinstalled image

take the qcow2 one

then you can boot it with `qemu-system-x86_64 -hda arch.img -m 8G -enable-kvm`

I will look at the xxd commands


[1/10/2024 5:56 PM] kuratius
what is it actually used for anyway?


[1/10/2024 5:56 PM] kuratius
it's a hexdump utility

why is it a dependency?

[1/10/2024 6:00 PM] szybet
convert command outputs pure bytes


[1/10/2024 6:01 PM] kuratius
oh so you use to store images as arrays


[1/10/2024 6:01 PM] kuratius
or something like that


[1/10/2024 6:01 PM] szybet
yes


[1/10/2024 6:01 PM] szybet
all other watchy firmwares use a website for it


[1/10/2024 6:01 PM] szybet
to update it in other watchy firmwares, you need to open that website, configure it, replace your file - in mine its just 1 click after editing the image

does the watchy have the concept of a filesystem?

are ram contents preserved between sleeps?


[1/10/2024 6:08 PM] szybet
nope


[1/10/2024 6:08 PM] szybet
only RTC ram which is like 8kb only


[1/10/2024 6:09 PM] kuratius
so it loads the image from disk every time anyway


[1/10/2024 6:09 PM] szybet
not from disk


[1/10/2024 6:09 PM] kuratius
only question is if loading the image is much slower than loading the array


[1/10/2024 6:09 PM] szybet
there is no disk


[1/10/2024 6:10 PM] kuratius
flash


[1/10/2024 6:10 PM] szybet

it is


[1/10/2024 6:10 PM] szybet
here you load pure bytes

[1/10/2024 6:10 PM] kuratius
cant I write the contents of a file directly to memory?


[1/10/2024 6:11 PM] kuratius
just make it a weird binary thing

pretty sure flash memory is addressable as ram anyway lol

XIP


[1/10/2024 6:11 PM] szybet
its not taking pure png and putting them into flash

its dithering them, making them monochrome, converting to pure 1 and 0 and then into variable


[1/10/2024 6:12 PM] kuratius
dithering/monochrome isnt done by xdd I think


[1/10/2024 6:12 PM] szybet
its not


[1/10/2024 6:12 PM] szybet
but still


[1/10/2024 6:12 PM] szybet
stop


[1/10/2024 6:13 PM] kuratius
If I figure out a way to load just the converted image from disk without extra processing, would you accept that change?


[1/10/2024 6:13 PM] szybet
its doing that now


[1/10/2024 6:13 PM] szybet
and there is no better way to do that


[1/10/2024 6:13 PM] kuratius
well


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius
you can probably do it without hardcoding assets in C files


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] szybet
then you are wasting resources


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] szybet
the end!


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius
and also I think the sm64 port does something like what you did for C files


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius
but it doesnt require that version of xdd to compile


[1/10/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius
so that's weird


[1/10/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
you can look for an alternative for xxd


[1/10/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
or rewrite it to python or smth

or something


[1/10/2024 6:30 PM] szybet
will look ugly in the folder


[1/10/2024 6:30 PM] szybet
you know you can compile xxd and just replace the binary on your system


[1/10/2024 6:30 PM] kuratius
less ugly than having to install arch to compile your project


[1/10/2024 6:30 PM] szybet
or put it in ~/.local/bin?


[1/10/2024 6:31 PM] szybet
install a system that is not outdated by 3 years


[1/10/2024 6:31 PM] kuratius
still dont actually know which repo you use for xxd


[1/10/2024 6:31 PM] kuratius
also like I said making this change is less work for me


[1/10/2024 6:31 PM] kuratius
so I'll do that


[1/10/2024 6:32 PM] kuratius

download xxd from there


[1/10/2024 6:32 PM] szybet
put it in  ~/.local/bin


[1/10/2024 6:32 PM] szybet
and run with it


[1/10/2024 6:32 PM] szybet
thats it


[1/10/2024 6:36 PM] kuratius
adding a variable to your script for the xxd  path sounds like a good compromise


[1/10/2024 6:37 PM] kuratius
and then put that into the readme


[1/10/2024 6:37 PM] kuratius
e.g. you can set a local variable XXD_PATH=/put/xxd/executable/here ./generate.sh


[1/10/2024 6:37 PM] kuratius
and then link the arch vim repo


[1/10/2024 6:38 PM] kuratius
and tell people to cd into the xxd directory and run make


[1/10/2024 6:38 PM] kuratius
avoids installing a vm


[1/10/2024 6:39 PM] kuratius
avoids fucking up people's vim install


[1/10/2024 6:40 PM] szybet
you can do that


[1/10/2024 6:40 PM] szybet
but at default, use the default xxd as its now


[1/10/2024 6:40 PM] kuratius
also actually you know what


[1/10/2024 6:41 PM] kuratius
you dont need -n at all if you are reading from stdin

it outputs the content between { } if you do that

[1/10/2024 6:42 PM] kuratius
so you can actually make it compatible with older xxd


[1/10/2024 6:42 PM] kuratius
even while preserving filenames with the way you are doing now


[1/10/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
do it


[1/10/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[1/10/2024 6:44 PM] kuratius
just need to append  unsigned char accept_png[] = {

run the command
append }


[1/10/2024 6:44 PM] kuratius
well


[1/10/2024 6:44 PM] kuratius
accept_png needs be replaced with your bash variable


[1/10/2024 6:44 PM] kuratius
but you get the point


[1/10/2024 6:46 PM] szybet
if it will work for you and for me, then sure


[1/10/2024 6:46 PM] szybet
there is also vault that needs to work


[1/10/2024 6:46 PM] szybet
there is xxd too

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/convertImages-7F1D8.sh


[1/10/2024 7:17 PM] kuratius
can probably be done in a prettier way


[1/10/2024 7:18 PM] kuratius
what's the line in vault that needs changes?


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] szybet
that one that uses xxd


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] szybet
it may work


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] szybet
idk


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] szybet
maybe write a function that does that...


[1/10/2024 7:26 PM] kuratius
how do I get book.h?


[1/10/2024 7:27 PM] kuratius
probably the python script in books but I dont think it runs


[1/10/2024 7:29 PM] kuratius
disabled BOOK in config.h for now


[1/10/2024 7:30 PM] kuratius
but book.txt not existing shouldnt give a compilation error


[1/10/2024 7:30 PM] kuratius
ok vault.h is missing?


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
you need to install a python package


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] kuratius
I installed it


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] kuratius
I think


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
and put there a book


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
whatever


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
read the readme once again


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
you can disable VAULT, BOOK, WIFI_TOOL


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] kuratius
what is vault anyway?


[1/10/2024 7:31 PM] szybet
encrypted images decrypted by a pin


[1/10/2024 7:32 PM] szybet
"phonebook"


[1/10/2024 7:32 PM] kuratius
ok yeah nobody needs that


[1/10/2024 7:32 PM] szybet
read the readme 🦗


[1/10/2024 7:32 PM] szybet
me, but yea its an option


[1/10/2024 7:33 PM] kuratius
disable it by default so people dont run into the error


[1/10/2024 7:34 PM] kuratius
also compile times are longer than I would expect


[1/10/2024 7:34 PM] kuratius
is there a lot of c++ instead of c code?


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] szybet
its propaly my fault, because of headers


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] szybet
i include them all in one file


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] szybet
so its longer, propably - idk
i know that the code looks super clean thanks to that soo


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] szybet
there is only c++


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] kuratius
github says you write C style


[1/10/2024 7:35 PM] kuratius
lol


[1/10/2024 7:36 PM] szybet
yea


[1/10/2024 7:36 PM] kuratius
(I think that's a good thing btw)


[1/10/2024 7:36 PM] szybet
i need to make that my personal changes wont be the default


[1/10/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
like a default directory and coppied from there and gitignore file the changed one, something like that


[1/10/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
hmmm arduino framework + espriff framework is c but with many c++ things, its best of both worlds


[1/10/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
like you can write simple code but under the code is a rtos you can use


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
and tasks, and many advanced functions


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
but strings for example are cpp like which is cool


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
or there are structs, classes, enums from cpp


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] kuratius
config.h has a comment that says wifi is supposed to be disabled via pio instead of the define


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] kuratius
is that right?


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
wifi_tool


[1/10/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
yes, if you dont want it


[1/10/2024 7:39 PM] szybet
just launch vscode at this point


[1/10/2024 7:39 PM] szybet
you need to choose the default env

does your project depend on vscode?


[1/10/2024 7:40 PM] kuratius
I disabled vault and wifi


[1/10/2024 7:41 PM] kuratius
and book


[1/10/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
um


[1/10/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
any errors?


[1/10/2024 7:41 PM] szybet
maybe you are missing something - again


[1/10/2024 7:44 PM] kuratius
I think it tried to build wifi_tool even though it's disabled

nope its not


[1/10/2024 8:21 PM] szybet
you can create your own watchface in my firmware too and just ifdef it
but you would need to create a system when to generate which images / fonts


[1/10/2024 8:22 PM] kuratius
grocery list modules that can be updated via a webinterface is probably nice


[1/10/2024 8:22 PM] kuratius
can actually use your ebook reader for that


[1/10/2024 8:22 PM] kuratius
come to think of it


[1/10/2024 8:22 PM] kuratius
better usecase anyway xD


[1/10/2024 8:22 PM] szybet
this is a cool idea


[1/10/2024 8:23 PM] szybet

you can leave it for a bit more protection or pull it off which makes more sense because einks are not reflective

btw shipping on my watchy says it's a v1.1


[1/14/2024 4:56 PM] szybet
idk


[1/14/2024 4:56 PM] szybet
send me a pic of the hardware


[1/14/2024 4:56 PM] szybet
or run my firmware and enter general debug menu


[1/14/2024 4:56 PM] szybet
that will tell you the version


[1/14/2024 5:00 PM] kuratius
your menu says 2.0


[1/14/2024 5:00 PM] kuratius
weird


[1/14/2024 5:00 PM] kuratius
shipping manifest still says v1.1


[1/14/2024 5:01 PM] kuratius
what is the display in the debug menu based on?


[1/14/2024 5:01 PM] kuratius
does it literally read 2.0 from the chip or is it an interpretation of some other value?


[1/14/2024 5:03 PM] kuratius
also I think your suggestion about getting a better case is good, with the current one the lio battery kind of flops around and it isnt protected against punctures


[1/14/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
RTC chip


[1/14/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
RTC chip


[1/14/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
the current one is a placeholder for "can be programmed safely until the new case arrived"

@Kuratius thanks for the pull request but:
1. make it as a function intead of 10 lines
2. in vault generation xxd is  also used - idk if it will work


[1/16/2024 8:17 PM] kuratius
I also pushed a commit that disables vault


[1/16/2024 8:17 PM] kuratius
so


[1/16/2024 8:23 PM] szybet
thats... not a solution


[1/16/2024 8:23 PM] kuratius
yeah but it'll result in less complaints until someone comes who decides they need vault


[1/16/2024 8:27 PM] kuratius
also do you want this as a function you can use like the original xxd or do you just mean so there's less lines?


[1/16/2024 8:27 PM] kuratius
I reduced it to 3 echos for now, can go to 2

@Szybet what call signature do you want?


[1/16/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
write a bash function that does those echoes


[1/16/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
just cleaner code


[1/16/2024 8:34 PM] szybet
you mean function name? idk whatever really - xxd_legacy_wrapper


[1/16/2024 8:34 PM] szybet
or smth like that


[1/16/2024 8:34 PM] szybet
xxd_legacy


[1/16/2024 8:34 PM] szybet
your decission I won't be picky about that


[1/16/2024 8:39 PM] kuratius
call signature includes arguments, but ok then I'll do it without


[1/16/2024 8:40 PM] szybet
do as you like


[1/16/2024 8:40 PM] kuratius
check pr


[1/16/2024 8:42 PM] szybet
i had in mind that you call a function instead of xxd in after convert etc


[1/16/2024 8:42 PM] szybet
this doesnt make really much sense now


[1/16/2024 8:43 PM] kuratius
that's why I initially didnt do it, waking a function that runs exactly once didnt make much sense to me


[1/16/2024 8:43 PM] szybet
or maybe create a script for easier stdout collection


[1/16/2024 8:43 PM] kuratius
because either you need to jump back and forth when reading this code


[1/16/2024 8:43 PM] kuratius
or you have extra lines for a function that gets redefined every loop iteration


[1/16/2024 8:43 PM] szybet
in vault, where i implement it or in other future places it will be used more


[1/16/2024 8:44 PM] kuratius
and it's also why I asked you for the arguments you want


[1/16/2024 8:44 PM] kuratius
call signature

i misunderstood, sorry


[1/16/2024 8:44 PM] szybet
maybe a script in a seperate file


[1/16/2024 8:44 PM] szybet
would be easier to use in other files


[1/16/2024 10:17 PM] kuratius
@Szybet


[1/16/2024 10:17 PM] kuratius
where do you want the function?


[1/16/2024 10:17 PM] kuratius
resources or src?


[1/16/2024 10:17 PM] kuratius
resources/images?


[1/16/2024 10:17 PM] szybet
resources i think


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] kuratius
aah fuck


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] kuratius
I didnt add the last argument to images.h


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] kuratius
as in


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] kuratius
I didnt replace images.h with $4


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] szybet
you still dont understand
dont replace all the convert stuff etc with that function, only xxd so it can be called instead of 
```
stuff convert or smth | xxd
```
and this doesnt work for you
```
stuff convert or smth maybe even vault | xxd_legacy
```
this will


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] kuratius
one sec


[1/16/2024 10:21 PM] szybet
this will make it modular and better


[1/16/2024 11:23 PM] kuratius
where does your bash script even copy from resources/images to defines?


[1/16/2024 11:28 PM] szybet
the script creates images.h


[1/16/2024 11:28 PM] szybet
then moves it


[1/16/2024 11:43 PM] kuratius
you should probably do that in the main script and not a subscript


[1/16/2024 11:43 PM] kuratius
like whaaat


[1/16/2024 11:44 PM] kuratius
anyway


[1/16/2024 11:44 PM] kuratius
Ah, I thought you were doing all the copying in the last script


[1/16/2024 11:54 PM] kuratius
maybe the imagedef belongs into a function argument


[1/16/2024 11:55 PM] kuratius
you figure it out, you want to use it

[1/16/2024 11:58 PM] kuratius
or just moved out of the function entirely


[1/17/2024 12:04 AM] kuratius
maybe add documentation to the meanining of $1 and $2


[1/17/2024 12:16 AM] szybet
Still wrong...
Dont make any specific things in that function regarding images. Just do the thing thaf newer xxd does

Accept stdin and output stdout
No writing to files


[1/17/2024 12:16 AM] szybet
Im talking about this image


[1/17/2024 12:16 AM] szybet
Idk what changes have you made later


[1/17/2024 12:58 AM] kuratius
This is better than your sed nonsense at least


[1/17/2024 12:59 AM] kuratius
This accepts stdin


[1/17/2024 12:59 AM] kuratius
And it outputs to stdout


[1/17/2024 1:02 AM] kuratius
If you want the last line outside just move it, I'm not going to read your mind. It already does what you need, which is changing the names of the array and the length variable using argument1 and 2 to the wrapper and it takes input from regular xxd via stdin


[1/17/2024 1:02 AM] kuratius
This is exactly what you need


[1/17/2024 1:04 AM] kuratius
You can move the call to xxd to the inside of the function if you're feeling funny but then passing parameters gets annoying because you have to pass them as a function argument.


[1/17/2024 1:08 AM] kuratius
Also I think technically array sizes should be size_t because some platforms can end up with 16 bit ints?


[1/17/2024 1:08 AM] kuratius
You don't want your code to be broken by that

The vim codebase is funny lol print or die


[1/17/2024 2:02 AM] kuratius
Apparently the code is fairly small, you could probably just include the .C file and compile it lol


[1/17/2024 2:03 AM] kuratius
Maybe clone the vim repo or this folder from the repo and compile


[1/17/2024 2:04 AM] kuratius
Then we don't have to argue about weird hacks to add the functionality you want and generate.sh can still run without modification on older systems


[1/17/2024 2:04 AM] kuratius
Just assumes someone has a C compiler I suppose


[1/17/2024 11:11 AM] szybet
will look into it later


[1/17/2024 6:12 PM] szybet
```

xxd_wrapper(){

    input_data=$(cat -)
    echo -e -n "const unsigned char  ${1} [] = {\n" 

    echo "$input_data"
    echo -e "};\nconst unsigned int ${1}d =(sizeof($1)/sizeof(${1}[0])) ;\n"

    echo -n -e "const ImageDef ${1}Pack = {${1}, ${2}_WIDTH, ${2}_HEIGHT};\n" 


}

```
nothing image dependent, nothing - to be able to use it from vault too...


[1/17/2024 6:12 PM] szybet
accept an argument for the variable name


[1/17/2024 6:13 PM] szybet
well maybe `    input_data=$(cat -)` does that


[1/17/2024 6:13 PM] kuratius

[1/17/2024 6:14 PM] szybet
ye i see i see


[1/17/2024 6:14 PM] szybet
just the imagedef thing


[1/17/2024 6:14 PM] kuratius
$1 is the first argument etc


[1/17/2024 6:14 PM] szybet
repair it and i will test it for the newer xxd


[1/17/2024 6:15 PM] kuratius
Also like I said int is the wrong type for an array size


[1/17/2024 6:15 PM] kuratius
Can I change that?


[1/17/2024 6:15 PM] szybet
yea sure


[1/17/2024 6:15 PM] szybet

[1/18/2024 1:04 AM] szybet
it should work


[1/18/2024 1:04 AM] szybet
will recheck tommorow and fix a few things too


[1/18/2024 2:02 AM] kuratius
shouldn't this be cat - ?     converted_data=$(cat | xxd $all_args)


[1/18/2024 2:07 AM] kuratius
oh and hey my pull request got accepted


[1/18/2024 2:38 AM] kuratius
Does the nullbyte issue only happen if you save as a variable directly?


[1/18/2024 2:40 AM] kuratius
I remember I ran into it, but forgot about it because my version used xxd's output as input, so it never gets fed a nullbyte


[1/18/2024 2:41 AM] kuratius
my priority was more avoiding having to write an argument parser in bash
