@djhardrich please post a boot log from serial when you can!


[6/14/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
Sure thing; that may take a few days to find the serial pins (unless you know of a way to force serial over the otg port)

what is this site


[6/14/2022 11:32‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
FCC Testing (US RF/electronic certifications)

thats such a cool website


[6/14/2022 11:33‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
And it‚Äôs posted right after certification, which is usually a few months before products launch üòâ


[6/14/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
Wait the Elipsa has a MicroSD??


[6/14/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
HOLY CRAP UNPOPULATED? I see that too

[6/14/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
Wait no wait


[6/14/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
Emmc or MicroSD?


[6/14/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
Unless that‚Äôs fpc connector for ribbon for screen


[6/14/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
probably


[6/14/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
though it's a small connector
usually they are bigger


[6/14/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
I'm sorry I'm just confused


[6/14/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] djhardrich

[6/14/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
Yeah exactly, it -does- look like a low-footprint microsd


[6/14/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah


[6/14/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
They (martgreat) sell all kinds of otg stuff for the elipsa but I have the other microsd/usbc adapter they sell and can confirm no power over vbus, they don‚Äôt work (unless externally powered? Will know in 2 days)


[6/14/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
Shouldn't that be for most, if not all, Kobos?


[6/14/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] the.mightydill
Or does only the Elipsa have OTG?


[6/14/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
microSD ought not to take that much power


[6/14/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] djhardrich
I‚Äôll run a dmesg really fast but pretty positive it doesn‚Äôt enumerate without external power

i don't think so, your only option would be the kernel

Nope, it‚Äôs not freescale like nia and iirc that‚Äôs the freescale imx way to set that (ci_hdrc); Elipsa has more in common with Sage

before I start taking things apart, want me to do a clean boot and post dmesg just for more general info? I‚Äôll be doing a small casemod to keep serial exposed so I have one with easy serial access

Update: had to order new tools to open the case (lost mine in the pile of electronics ü§£), shows up tomorrow‚Ä¶. Power Y splitter came and works with rm2 after changing module flags to set otg to host; does -not- work with elipsa out of the box, so either a kernel rebuild with otg turned on, or a sunxi-specific flag to turn on otg host is required


[6/17/2022 7:47‚ÄØAM] djhardrich
Got OTG enabled on Elipsa, enumerates device then eventually crashes..
```
echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/usbc0/otg_role

```


[6/17/2022 9:59‚ÄØAM] szybet
How it crashes? Logs?


[6/17/2022 10:02‚ÄØAM] djhardrich
Reboots itself after a relatively-short period of time, trying to scrape logs.. Strangely, cat‚Äôing /dev/hidraw0/1 didn‚Äôt get me any output when pressing keys (0 was what was assigned to keyboard according to dmesg).


[6/17/2022 10:11‚ÄØAM] djhardrich
Stock fw doesn‚Äôt seem to be saving  anything to /var/log (which exists). Got some keyboard input, joy for about 2mins and reboot


[6/17/2022 10:27‚ÄØAM] djhardrich
An aside: manually pairing/trusting trackball and keyboard with bluetoothctl -does- seem to be stable/persistent across reboots. Much more stable than pairing in Settings, I‚Äôm guessing it doesn‚Äôt do the extra step of trusting the devices


[6/17/2022 12:13‚ÄØPM] ninuje
It logs to a ring buffer, so no persistence


[6/17/2022 12:14‚ÄØPM] ninuje
`logread`


[6/17/2022 12:14‚ÄØPM] ninuje
You might need to enable some more verbose logs in nickel's dev menu


[6/17/2022 12:14‚ÄØPM] ninuje
(search for devmodeon in nickel, it then pops up in the Settings in device info IIRC)


[6/17/2022 12:15‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Might want to run `klogd` first so you get interleaved kernel logging with timestamps


[6/17/2022 12:15‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Because old kernel with crappy printk

You might want to start documenting things on the Wiki like for the PRS-T1 page (by NonaSuomy) https://inkbox.ddns.net/wiki/index.php?title=Sony_PRS-T1
Experiment around a bit, try to get U-Boot to let you a shell, try to trigger download mode, etc. You can write a lot of things there if you find it's useful
