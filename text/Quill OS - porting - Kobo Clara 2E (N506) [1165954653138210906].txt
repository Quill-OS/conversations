first read other porting threads to understand what is needed


[10/23/2023 12:08 PM] szybet
kobo nia's threads are good to start with

there is some 5.16 fork of mainline linux


[10/28/2023 10:15 PM] andi15701
for it


[10/28/2023 10:15 PM] andi15701
based on my works


[10/28/2023 10:15 PM] andi15701
including u-boot


[10/28/2023 10:16 PM] andi15701
so that might be helpful


[10/28/2023 10:16 PM] andi15701
first step: a good documentation how to get the uSD card out....


[10/29/2023 8:07 AM] nisirfalas
I read some parts of the Kobo Nia threads and I think I can try with Kobo Clara 2E. I'll be home soon and can probably start to open it middle / end of next week. Will report back about how to get the SD card out. Thanks.

some working results:


[3/27/2024 7:37 PM] andi15701
there is an A and B here too


[3/27/2024 7:37 PM] andi15701
difference EPD PMIC


[3/27/2024 7:38 PM] andi15701
SY7636 vs. JD9930


[3/27/2024 7:38 PM] andi15701
can probably detected in u-boot


[3/27/2024 7:40 PM] andi15701
which model do you have?


[3/27/2024 7:40 PM] andi15701
I have B


[3/27/2024 7:56 PM] szybet

btw:


[3/29/2024 5:24 PM] andi15701
fake_s1d13522_initEx3:VCOM from HWCONFIG 0xff15=>-235 10mV,-2350000 uV


[3/29/2024 5:25 PM] andi15701
that is on the b different from anything else I have seen before, usually there is a value stored non-volatile in the epd pmic


[3/29/2024 5:26 PM] andi15701
not sure about the implications yet


[3/29/2024 11:04 PM] andi15701
first picture with some recent kernel on the B, was relaxed enough with dealing with the dirty jd9930 regulator code
