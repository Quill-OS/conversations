Great work!

Well, credit goes to the main developer

Porting that to KoBox was relatively easy
Without wanting to brag, my plugin/extensions system is really straightforward to setup/use/understand


[5/1/2022 6:14 AM] nonasuomy
Is it documented? You should put something up so others can do the same process with ease


[5/1/2022 6:14 AM] tux_linux
Compiling was really nice too
It's just GTK code in C


[5/1/2022 6:15 AM] nonasuomy
It's all fun and games until you have to document things 😄


[5/1/2022 6:15 AM] tux_linux
yeah, I have to do that
but basically, an extension only contains a part of a big root filesystem which contains the files and the things necessary to run the program.
extensions are merged via overlayfs/unionfs magic at boot

It is probably our last hope to get a functional browser in InkBox

You would think someone would make a browser that would clear all content and just give you articles  of the textual data by now.

IIRC, the Alpine Kindle images run all kinds of browser stuff (painfully slowly, but they do it ;p)


[5/2/2022 1:22 AM] tux_linux
Yes, chromium works on the pw3, aka a Glo HD in terms of SoC
So chromium should work there too, but devices like the Libra won't run it properly for an unknown reason.

It's a shame that you can't compress images on websites when you go to them

[6/9/2022 3:30 PM] tux_linux
both are high-cpu intensive applications


[6/9/2022 3:30 PM] tux_linux
without midori it takes 2mins?


[6/9/2022 3:39 PM] szybet
1. Its an ereader. It's fine
2. Onboard has such many options that those 2 min are worth it. Maybe in the future rewriting it makes sense, now other we have other prorities: in unfreezing xorg, user apps and power demon


[6/9/2022 3:39 PM] tux_linux
It's strange, I thought you would be the last person to say this


[6/9/2022 3:40 PM] tux_linux
2 mins is still bearable but 7 mins with midori is quite painful


[6/9/2022 3:43 PM] tux_linux
but you are right, anyways I wasn't planning to find a fix for this right now, got way too many things to fix already


[6/9/2022 3:57 PM] szybet
Im using onboard on other devices. Its great software, its slow on a ereader but had many options, customisations. There are years of work in it

Python still can be used to create great software, but where it needs performance it shouldnt be used and be rewritten if it is. Kobox apps are launching ~5 minutes anyway so shrug


[6/9/2022 5:18 PM] tux_linux
Yes, I agree
Maybe there is a way to compile it to pyc files to improve performance

X.org running on a Kobo Libra (pt. 2)
A great, great increase in speed. This runs in an Alpine Linux chroot.

well okay


[4/22/2023 10:42 PM] szybet
still works like crap


[4/22/2023 10:42 PM] szybet
VNC still is the way to go


[4/22/2023 10:43 PM] kuratius
is there an app to control your phone/use the eink as a big screen for it?


[4/22/2023 10:44 PM] szybet
vnc protocol


[4/22/2023 10:44 PM] szybet
litterally


[4/22/2023 10:44 PM] kuratius
that works on android?


[4/22/2023 10:44 PM] kuratius
with touch?


[4/22/2023 10:45 PM] szybet
it's litterally in inkbox right now ~~wasn't a good experience because of screen size, configs, wifi but hey, its only my experience~~


[4/22/2023 10:45 PM] kuratius
(I'm genuinely asking)


[4/22/2023 10:46 PM] kuratius
there's probably a way to hack it it make it like using a tablet
I know there's people who really want eink tablets, if it was a good experience to use an existing tablet or phone over eink they might choose that


[4/22/2023 10:47 PM] kuratius
idk what the latency is like though


[4/22/2023 10:47 PM] kuratius
probably still lower than the screen


[4/22/2023 10:47 PM] kuratius
so prob doesnt matter


[4/22/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
maybe, propably

Hey there, been wanting to get myself a e-ink reader, but couldn't stand to have to rely on proprietary firmware, so the InkBox project was right up my alley. From what i see the firmware device list, all of those are considered in the same level of stability ? I doesn't really know which one i should go with, as they are mostly all EOL devices. Kind of like the idea on tinkering with it possibly, but i doubt i might manage to port some other apps or help more myself.

@tux-linux


[8/14/2023 6:44 PM] szybet
The tldr is: kobo nia is the newest and its goos


[8/14/2023 6:44 PM] szybet
Good


[8/14/2023 6:44 PM] poorpocketsmcnewhold
That's straight to the point. Nice !


[8/14/2023 6:57 PM] tux_linux
Glo HD is probably better


[8/14/2023 6:57 PM] tux_linux
More ram


[8/14/2023 6:58 PM] szybet
He asked for never devices


[8/14/2023 6:58 PM] tux_linux
well, ok


[8/14/2023 6:59 PM] poorpocketsmcnewhold
Not necesserally. Just said i noticed most where EOL, but didn't considered it a bad thing


[8/14/2023 6:59 PM] tux_linux
InkBox supports 12 yo devices


[8/14/2023 6:59 PM] poorpocketsmcnewhold
It's mostly why i asked, because i would have surely just use their own website comparator for such.

I'm definitely one of those people.  I have a hisense a5, and a hisense a7cc.  Currently I'm using the Hisense A7cc, but it barely functions as a phone.  Sometimes I get calls, sometimes calls don't go through and I don't even have a record of having missed it.  No group texts at all.  Sometimes regular texts work, but usually not.  It functions as a wifi tablet, but I don't like how locked down it is, or that important parts of the system are only in Chinese.

Today I tried Geany through Kobox on the Kobo Nia.  It was a rough experience.  Most of the screen was some version of gray.  I figured out the top was a menu, but it just flashed and didn't stay long enough to select anything.  I couldn't figure out how to back out of Geany, and ended up restarting my Nia, briefly ending up in Diagnostics mode, before I got back to the home screen.


[10/8/2023 9:53 PM] szybet
kobox is a mess, halfly not even working at all. It was propably depth eink problems again

TLDR: Until something motivates us to fix it for the 10 time, or someone else fixes it dont use xorg, shut it off - there are better native user apps anyway

Sometimes if you put it to sleep then wake it up it starts working again


[10/8/2023 9:59 PM] szybet
sometimes


[10/8/2023 9:59 PM] szybet
still a mess - if he is one nia c it is random at all


[10/8/2023 9:59 PM] dandelionkoi
I'm just going to stay out of kobox now that I know


[10/8/2023 10:00 PM] szybet
user apps are better in every way anyway


[10/8/2023 10:00 PM] szybet
kobos is barely usable even if it would work


[10/8/2023 10:01 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Yes, it's crap but probably out of our knowledge why
