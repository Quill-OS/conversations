This, as an userapp without the KOReader stuff, would be awesome
https://github.com/koreader/koreader/pull/8636
@NiLuJe is it possible to run only this plugin with its deps and not the whole KOReader framework?

You'd need a minimal custom UIManager main loop with at least Device properly instanciated


[8/21/2022 4:08 AM] ninuje
And the right dep tree for that


[8/21/2022 4:08 AM] ninuje
It's not impossible, but it requires some thinking, and almost the full tree anyway


[8/21/2022 4:09 AM] ninuje
Plus, I might have broken the headless indirections that would make this somewhat easier ;p.


[8/21/2022 4:23 AM] tux_linux

@Szybet this one is similar to sff but seems to be more flexible in implementing widgets (it already has tabs, adding keyboard keys should not be that hard). I got libvterm compilation issues but it should be fixable as we did compile it successfully for sff. There are also older functions that need to get migrated but I think it's fixable
The other option is to use KOReader's terminal, but I don't know how I feel putting the whole KOReader in an userapp

In case it's useful for anyone, I compiled the most recent version of zig from source for arm-linux-musleabihf and tested it on the nia. Works fine, at least on the postmarketOS port. The zig compiler can also compile C and C++, not just zig, so this may be be useful for some people. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Op8M1fchu9zJaZZmvOmYJEv2y72p3o1F/view?usp=share_link
Zig doesn't have an official release for arm32 and the zig-bootstrap script failed for me, so I had to download a recent enough zig release that can compile the stage3 self hosted compiler and compile that.
Compilation options for the compiler were 
```zig build -Dtarget=arm-linux-musleabihf -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dcpu=baseline``` in case anyone wants to reproduce it for a newer version of zig. (This has to be executed inside the zig repo with a working installation of zig)

[5/4/2023 6:36 PM] kuratius
(there are other options like Debug or ReleaseSmall for small binaries, but I figured if someone is going to compile something on a weak cpu they'll care more about the speed than how much disk space the compiler takes)


[5/4/2023 6:38 PM] kuratius

[5/4/2023 6:49 PM] kuratius
```Note: Generally, for Linux targets, we prefer the musl libc builds over the glibc builds here, because musl builds end up producing a static binary, which is more portable across Linux distributions.```

(this is a musl build)

Have you tried compiling something in musl?

[5/4/2023 6:53 PM] kuratius
cant you replace glibc with musl? or is that problematic for other projects?


[5/4/2023 6:54 PM] kuratius
zig states that it can also link against older versions of glibc, though not sure if that was talking about the compiler or the compiled projects in general

Both in a single system, not program


[5/4/2023 8:36 PM] kuratius
then that's probably not relevant, I was talking in the context of compiling software that wasnt before due to glibc incompatibility with gcc


[5/4/2023 8:38 PM] kuratius
anyway, native-arm32 zig compiler is broken, but the cross compiling still produces working executables for arm32, but unless you have a project that you were trying to use which wouldnt compile before that's not super useful


[5/5/2023 1:49 AM] kuratius
I'll see if I can get a working arm32 zig compiler, just for fun

May not be directly relevant, but I hope this supports webtoon mode like openComic (infinite scroll mode), if it doesn't it's not useful

[7/27/2023 2:12 PM] kuratius
Still very obvious to me when it's missing, I read manga in webtoon mode too because it's just better


[7/27/2023 2:12 PM] kuratius
Zooming in is a special kind of hell reserved for those who can't do webtoon mode


[7/27/2023 2:13 PM] szybet
welp you can try it, then port it to inkbox ( pm os whatever ) :D


[7/27/2023 2:16 PM] kuratius
Probably wouldn't have good performance due to JS
Still, Comic on small eink device means either lots of zooming or a scrolling mode, neither is fun, but one is better than the other because a scroll takes one refresh, a zoom takes 2 or 3 (zoom in and out,  or zoom in, pan right, pan down left, etc)


[7/27/2023 2:16 PM] szybet
im talking about the first one

Rust just doesn't compile std, it puts a binary blob


[7/30/2023 4:08 PM] szybet
there is something with std for size something


[7/30/2023 4:09 PM] kuratius
Rust's std requires an unstable compiler for some stupid reason


[7/30/2023 4:09 PM] szybet
its nightly


[7/30/2023 4:09 PM] szybet
and its not unstable


[7/30/2023 4:09 PM] szybet
i have seen real companies using nightly, not for production but still


[7/30/2023 4:10 PM] kuratius
If it was stable it'd be stable rust


[7/30/2023 4:11 PM] kuratius
Just really backwards to call your language stable when the standard library requires an unstable compiler


[7/30/2023 4:11 PM] szybet
you really expect a lot from a project starting from 2017? 19?


[7/30/2023 4:11 PM] szybet
c is older than you and me combined


[7/30/2023 4:21 PM] kuratius
Basic compilers aren't that hard if you don't overcomplicate your syntax and add new features every year, and instead focus on writing a better std

Rust first stable release was in 2015


[7/30/2023 4:22 PM] szybet
rust started to go mainstream later

[8/1/2023 5:01 AM] kuratius
but I think that's outdated


[8/1/2023 5:04 AM] kuratius
``` The GCC 12 and 13 releases include a complete implementation of the Go 1.18 standard library. However, GCC does not yet include support for generics. ```


[8/1/2023 5:04 AM] kuratius
fuck


[8/1/2023 5:04 AM] kuratius
gomuks is 1.19


[8/1/2023 5:07 AM] kuratius
maybe in a year or two when gcc-14 or 15 is out


[8/1/2023 5:11 AM] kuratius
oh


[8/1/2023 5:12 AM] kuratius
apparently I was using golang-go 1.18 to compile gomuks and it worked


[8/1/2023 5:12 AM] kuratius
so that 1.19 is a lie


[8/1/2023 5:13 AM] kuratius
so technically if I can get gccgo-go in a version with gccgo 1.18 it would work


[8/1/2023 5:13 AM] kuratius
the current default in xubuntu's repo is for gcc-11


[8/1/2023 5:13 AM] kuratius
so either gcc-12 or gcc-13 should be able to compile gomuks


[8/1/2023 5:19 AM] kuratius
gcc-12 maybe cant, I'm getting errors, but for some reason it hasnt aborted


[8/1/2023 5:23 AM] kuratius

only question is sort of if mutool can do epub to html

why

epub is html

you dont need to delete stuff

oh hey pandoc is haskell

exporting epubs to html is a cool way to read epubs in browser, actually

[8/3/2023 7:54 AM] kuratius
or am I misunderstanding something?


[8/3/2023 7:55 AM] szybet
even if you compile it to musl somehow - it will be slow... its webkit


[8/3/2023 7:55 AM] szybet
then every binary will be huuuge


[8/3/2023 7:55 AM] szybet
otherwise idk


[8/3/2023 7:55 AM] kuratius
custom secondary libc to link agaist?


[8/3/2023 7:55 AM] kuratius
is that a thing?


[8/3/2023 7:56 AM] szybet
why would it? glibc is limited by kernel


[8/3/2023 7:56 AM] szybet
idk if kernel 4.15 would work for qt webkit if we had the newest possible glibc


[8/3/2023 7:57 AM] kuratius
nia c can use I suppose?
idc how libc and kernel incompability works, but that one had a newer kernel I think


[8/3/2023 7:57 AM] szybet
it doesnt


[8/3/2023 7:57 AM] szybet
its not never


[8/3/2023 7:58 AM] kuratius
you said so on the github?


[8/3/2023 7:58 AM] szybet
anyway, the glibc is old because of oooold mini kernel 2.6
we could use a newer for some devices


[8/3/2023 7:58 AM] szybet
its stil 4.x


[8/3/2023 7:59 AM] kuratius
for the time being, how large is compiling libc into a project?


[8/3/2023 7:59 AM] kuratius
statically


[8/3/2023 7:59 AM] szybet
you can write a self hosted API that does these things remotely... 🥴


[8/3/2023 7:59 AM] szybet
idk if you can do it statically


[8/3/2023 7:59 AM] szybet
idk


[8/3/2023 8:02 AM] szybet
qt webkit is not the answer, it would be slow


[8/3/2023 9:15 AM] kuratius
even for prerendering?


[8/3/2023 10:49 AM] szybet
yes, too heavy as i said


[8/3/2023 10:49 AM] szybet
the only diffrence between rendering and showing it on screen is dumping it to the eink

[8/3/2023 11:46 AM] kuratius
so if an html tag is not supported there cant be a markdown workaround?


[8/3/2023 11:47 AM] szybet
propably, yes


[8/3/2023 11:47 AM] szybet
you could, like pandoc with some latex options turn those characters to images


[8/3/2023 11:47 AM] kuratius
HTML was a mistake, webpages should be in latex


[8/3/2023 11:47 AM] kuratius
clearly


[8/3/2023 11:47 AM] szybet
latex is too complicated


[8/3/2023 11:48 AM] szybet
lets say it like that


[8/3/2023 11:48 AM] szybet
latex is too complicated for simple things
html is too complicated for complex things


[8/3/2023 11:48 AM] kuratius
latex is turing complete


[8/3/2023 11:48 AM] kuratius
😛


[8/3/2023 11:48 AM] kuratius
is html?


[8/3/2023 11:53 AM] kuratius
that's going to be a lot of images
would not recommend
anyway I really wonder why ruby isnt supported.
It cant be that hard to squeeze characters into the space between lines, under normal circumstances it will not go beyond the margins so no need for linebreaking or trying to paginate it


[8/3/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
im sure ^ is supported


[8/3/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
as in 2^3 = 8


[8/3/2023 11:54 AM] kuratius
needs to be shifted slightly above and centered


[8/3/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
we can just go with one image


[8/3/2023 11:54 AM] kuratius
are images allowed to overlap with text?


[8/3/2023 11:55 AM] kuratius
or be displayed in between lines?


[8/3/2023 11:55 AM] kuratius
pandoc has the capability to render ruby correctly with no effort because \overset{}{} in latex exists


[8/3/2023 11:55 AM] kuratius
they just choose not to


[8/3/2023 11:56 AM] szybet
i dont think so


[8/3/2023 11:56 AM] szybet
not in a good looking way, yes


[8/3/2023 11:56 AM] kuratius
literally I could just rewrite every ruby tag in to an overset command


[8/3/2023 11:57 AM] szybet
write a script for it


[8/3/2023 11:57 AM] kuratius
depends, is there going to be a latex renderer ?

[8/3/2023 12:00 PM] szybet
for some things at least


[8/3/2023 12:01 PM] kuratius
if tinytex is resonably fast then could probably do what I suggested (or use the commands I gave before) and prerender to pdf


[8/3/2023 12:01 PM] kuratius
would at least not be slower than koreader


[8/3/2023 12:02 PM] szybet
well try it


[8/3/2023 12:02 PM] kuratius
and since it would be dynamic it would support font size changes etc


[8/3/2023 12:02 PM] szybet
would be cool

Tolino Epos 3 REVIEW: Hidden Android ereader
Today I'm doing the world’s first hands-on review of the Tolino Epos 3. 

It’s an 8 inch ereader with a 300 ppi E-Ink Carta 1200 display, and if you like – also with Android.

Find out in the video, what I mean by that and how the Epos 3 performs in everyday use.

at least the epos can run android+java, low spec models probabyl cant


[8/13/2023 3:01 PM] kuratius
and I guess the backend is still android webview anyway


[8/13/2023 3:01 PM] kuratius
and that might not be java


[8/13/2023 3:02 PM] szybet
as i said before, inkbox is focused on cheap, small eink devices to unlock them for more

those that cost 300 eur ( 3 nias, 2 xiaom phones... ) should run at least decent android or linux with such external apps already enabled

So I have read the wiki and the readme on github regarding user applications. Just for testing purposes I decided to extract Sketch.zip from the same into the relevant folder .apps, however a new gui app did not appear after the restart.


[9/29/2023 1:40 PM] [matrix] adamame
Nevermind I rebooted the device a few addition times and it got recognized.

[9/29/2023 6:09 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Its sandboxed obviously


[9/29/2023 6:09 PM] [matrix] Szybet

item?

[9/29/2023 6:10 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Look up inkbox issues on github related to glo wifi, there is a guide how to root


[9/29/2023 6:10 PM] [matrix] adamame
ok thanks


[9/29/2023 6:56 PM] [matrix] adamame
I got into diagnostics and enabled usbnet, managed to telnet in.


[9/29/2023 6:56 PM] [matrix] adamame
however I don't see any option to root the device in diagnostics


[9/29/2023 7:01 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Did you go into reset options


[9/29/2023 7:01 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Also if you were able to telnet you are probably already rooted
Otherwise there is a problem somewhere


[9/29/2023 7:03 PM] [matrix] adamame
man I completely overlooked it in the reset options


[9/29/2023 7:27 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] adamame 
now after the reset how should I acces this file / dir, I don't see it in /etc/init.d when telneted


[9/29/2023 7:30 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Ssh into it


[9/29/2023 7:30 PM] [matrix] Szybet
No telney


[9/29/2023 7:32 PM] [matrix] adamame
ok then, is the port 22?


[9/29/2023 7:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the default one


[9/29/2023 7:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
for usbnet and ssh you need to set the ip address


[9/29/2023 7:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
something like that


[9/29/2023 7:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
sudo ifconfig enp0s20f0u5 192.168.2.3/24


[9/29/2023 7:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ip address and subnet is important


[9/29/2023 7:38 PM] [matrix] adamame
yeah I know, had to do it for telent already


[9/29/2023 7:42 PM] [matrix] adamame
the problem is it wont let me in with ssh but it will with telnet


[9/29/2023 7:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
errors? logs?


[9/29/2023 7:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what command do you use


[9/29/2023 7:44 PM] [matrix] adamame
since there is no ifconfig on my system i use ```ip addr add 192.168.2.3/24 dev usb0```


[9/29/2023 7:45 PM] [matrix] Szybet
show me ip a command output


[9/29/2023 7:45 PM] [matrix] adamame

[9/29/2023 7:48 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you resetted the device to be rooted yes?


[9/29/2023 7:48 PM] [matrix] adamame
yes I did


[9/29/2023 7:49 PM] [matrix] adamame
it asked me for onboard storage size so I selected the default which is 64mib


[9/29/2023 7:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
thats too low but whatever can be changed later


[9/29/2023 7:50 PM] [matrix] adamame
what does it even mean, is it the ram size or something completely else?


[9/29/2023 7:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
size of storage for books, apps


[9/29/2023 7:51 PM] [matrix] adamame
alright


[9/29/2023 7:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
does nmap show port 22 open?


[9/29/2023 7:51 PM] [matrix] adamame
I am reseting the device once more


[9/29/2023 7:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
wont change much


[9/29/2023 7:52 PM] [matrix] adamame
I will try once again and send the nmap output


[9/29/2023 7:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ok, im waiting


[9/29/2023 7:53 PM] [matrix] adamame
go grab a cup of tea or something it takes some time to reset it


[9/29/2023 8:05 PM] [matrix] adamame
yes I forgot to mention I on the model C nia inkbox


[9/29/2023 8:05 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ooooh


[9/29/2023 8:05 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yea this doesnt explain much anyway


[9/29/2023 8:06 PM] [matrix] adamame
It has almost finished restting


[9/29/2023 8:31 PM] [matrix] adamame
nmap says the only port openned is telnet


[9/29/2023 8:31 PM] [matrix] adamame
23/tcp


[9/29/2023 8:32 PM] [matrix] adamame
no wonder it didn't work


[9/29/2023 8:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ummm


[9/29/2023 8:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
is the gui on?


[9/29/2023 8:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the main UI


[9/29/2023 8:37 PM] [matrix] adamame
Am I this stupid


[9/29/2023 8:38 PM] [matrix] adamame
i didn't read it properly and thought it has to be done in diagnostics


[9/29/2023 8:38 PM] [matrix] adamame
in gui it is opened


[9/29/2023 8:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
😄


[9/29/2023 8:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you are in shell


[9/29/2023 8:39 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you got futher than 80% of all people that tried


[9/29/2023 8:39 PM] [matrix] adamame
username should be root right?


[9/29/2023 8:40 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes


[9/29/2023 8:40 PM] [matrix] adamame
password should be blank, or why is it asking for one


[9/29/2023 8:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
password is "root"


[9/29/2023 8:41 PM] [matrix] adamame
the moment of truth then


[9/29/2023 8:42 PM] [matrix] adamame
I am in


[9/29/2023 8:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
congratulations


[9/29/2023 8:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
now look at the file in etc we mentioned and figure out how to disable sign verification


[9/29/2023 8:45 PM] [matrix] adamame
Oh man another problem has appeared the connection drops after always drops after 10 seconds


[9/29/2023 8:45 PM] [matrix] adamame
I will try changing the cable


[9/29/2023 8:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what DE are you using


[9/29/2023 8:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
KDE with network manager tries to use DHCP on the device so it disconnects


[9/29/2023 8:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you need to turn it off


[9/29/2023 8:47 PM] [matrix] adamame
I do use networkmanager (artix linux, i3)


[9/29/2023 8:47 PM] [matrix] adamame
then time to disable it


[9/29/2023 8:47 PM] [matrix] Szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[9/29/2023 9:19 PM] [matrix] adamame
Oh boy, so I read the gui_apps script and there I saw devmode="$(cat /opt/something/keys/something)" and a comment that it disables sign verification. So I created the file it mentioned and made its content equal true. However, now I cannot mount or ssh. What have I done?


[9/29/2023 9:20 PM] [matrix] Szybet
a lot of the system went broke


[9/29/2023 9:20 PM] [matrix] Szybet
hehe


[9/29/2023 9:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
disconnect the sd card, mount partition 3, there in rootfs/write find the file you created and replace it with the one i send you on private message


[9/29/2023 9:23 PM] [matrix] adamame
ok I am awaiting the file then


[9/29/2023 9:23 PM] [matrix] Szybet
uhm well i dont have it


[9/29/2023 9:23 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nicolas why


[9/29/2023 9:23 PM] [matrix] Szybet
tux-linux: tux-linux tux-linux give me it and to the guy


[9/29/2023 9:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
for now just remove the file you created


[9/29/2023 9:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
boot the ereader and check if everything works


[9/29/2023 9:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and now only save changes if you are sure of what you are doing


[9/29/2023 9:25 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and ask before doing things too, dont be afraid


[9/29/2023 9:25 PM] [matrix] adamame
you learn from your mistakes


[9/29/2023 9:26 PM] [matrix] Szybet
I also needed to reset inkbox a lot of times, until i made the sd card external so now i dont care ;D


[9/29/2023 9:26 PM] [matrix] adamame
To disbale signature verification did I have to actually modify the iniy script?


[9/29/2023 9:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
for gui apps, yes


[9/29/2023 9:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
easiest way to do this


[9/29/2023 9:28 PM] [matrix] adamame
the comment above devmode was promising to make it work


[9/29/2023 9:28 PM] [matrix] adamame
*looked promisinf


[9/29/2023 9:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes, but not with putting true in it

[9/29/2023 9:31 PM] [matrix] Szybet
here is the line that is checking apps key


[9/29/2023 9:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
just make it always true, the if statement like true = true but in shell syntax


[9/29/2023 9:32 PM] [matrix] adamame
if true; then


[9/29/2023 9:32 PM] [matrix] adamame
should suffice


[9/29/2023 9:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i hate shell and i cant program in it


[9/29/2023 9:33 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so dont ask me about it


[9/29/2023 9:33 PM] [matrix] adamame
I know a bit of shell


[9/29/2023 9:33 PM] [matrix] adamame
this will work


[9/29/2023 9:40 PM] [matrix] adamame
Sorry to bother you again, I have trouble mounting rootfs partition. It says write protected but read-write mode requested


[9/29/2023 9:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
?


[9/29/2023 9:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what? where?


[9/29/2023 9:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
on PC?


[9/29/2023 9:41 PM] [matrix] adamame
yes


[9/29/2023 9:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
look up dmesg if it spits out something about sd card being messy


[9/29/2023 9:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
second look up mount command and force + mount write arguments


[9/29/2023 9:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and use it


[9/29/2023 9:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
should be fine


[9/29/2023 9:44 PM] [matrix] adamame
Made it


[9/29/2023 9:45 PM] [matrix] Szybet
does everything work? then save the file and boot the os

he is toored already?...


[9/29/2023 10:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what are you trying to achieve


[9/29/2023 10:36 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
uid
developer key


[9/29/2023 10:36 PM] matterbridge#2154

I didnt shared the keys


[9/29/2023 10:37 PM] matterbridge#2154

do you generate a random uid and match a developer key for it or what

[9/29/2023 10:37 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
its designed to work only for one device with one uid


[9/29/2023 10:38 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] tux-linux 
then, please reboot and see if this outputs the same thing
if not, tell me


[9/29/2023 10:39 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
lol how? its flawed already and gives extra steps


[9/29/2023 10:40 PM] [matrix] Szybet
first you just need to match the UID which is just another dd command


[9/29/2023 10:40 PM] [matrix] Szybet
recompiling kernel should be enough to overwrite the code


[9/29/2023 10:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i dont see any point in it, even if it works correctly only for this one uid ( i would love it to be explained how lol )


[9/29/2023 10:41 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
well, yes, but i don't see a better solution


[9/29/2023 10:41 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
it already limits hacking possibilities for people that are less aware of how the system works


[9/29/2023 10:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
im sure adamame would figure it out in another 15 minutes in the gui apps script


[9/29/2023 10:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it should be just a switch in rooted kernel to disable veryfication anyway, thats it


[9/29/2023 10:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
there is a reason all those big tech companies require for a "developer key" for a dev kit or anything a stable internet connection to their servers


[9/29/2023 10:43 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
well, if it was just a switch, it wouldn't require signing the uid by a main developer
so, less secure


[9/29/2023 10:44 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] tux-linux 
sure
you want to implement that?


[9/29/2023 10:44 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
go ahead


[9/29/2023 10:45 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the system is flawed, how can you sign a uid

one developer key leaks, one UUID leaks and the whole system goes away


[9/29/2023 10:45 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the only reason i see this to know who leaked the key, that's it


[9/29/2023 10:45 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
are we big tech companies? should we care?


[9/29/2023 10:45 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
no


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
but maybe eventually it would be nice


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
we leave it for it


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
`the system is flawed, how can you sign a uid`


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
explain this


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
wdym


[9/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you have random bytes


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] Szybet
how do you sign them with a public key already on the device


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
a private key


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
that is not on the device


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
i sign it here


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
public key is only for verification


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and the uid does what


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes i said it wrong i understand it


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Universal IDentifier


[9/29/2023 10:47 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so what


[9/29/2023 10:48 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
so you can't have two devices with the same uid
if you don't overwrite anything


[9/29/2023 10:48 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
it's 256 bytes
random enough it doesn't repeat somewhere else


[9/29/2023 10:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so what, how in the signing process does the uid do anything


[9/29/2023 10:49 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
well, if somehow the uid was on a rom, the developer key would only work for one device


[9/29/2023 10:49 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
that's the idea


[9/29/2023 10:49 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
of course it can be overwritten on kobos


[9/29/2023 10:50 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
on kindle I think it's on a separate chip
maybe


[9/29/2023 10:50 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
i don't remember correctly


[9/29/2023 10:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you have the unique 256 bytes in the signing process ***what do you do with them to make it work***


[9/29/2023 10:52 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
i sign 256 bytes


[9/29/2023 10:52 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
that's it


[9/29/2023 10:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
boom thats what i wanted to hear


[9/29/2023 10:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so my points stands


[9/29/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it doesnt protect against anything, we only would know who leaked the key


[9/29/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
start making the list then


[9/29/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
?


[9/29/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
list of requested developers keys


[9/29/2023 10:54 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
well, ok


[9/29/2023 10:54 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
i think he's the first one


[9/29/2023 10:54 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yes


[9/29/2023 10:54 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i didnt cared


[9/29/2023 11:18 PM] matterbridge#2154

what

i think he wants to know if there is a web browser in inkbox


[12/23/2023 1:06 AM] [matrix] tux-linux
as a matter of fact, yes and no


[12/23/2023 1:07 AM] [matrix] tux-linux
tldr: it isn't great


[1/7/2024 6:34 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Hi, Just a quick question about app installation: where exactly do I have to unzip the folder? I tried directly on the 4th partition of the SD card but nothing shows up, I then tried to use the USB trasfer function (connecting the Kobo to the pc) but at that point the folders shows up in the "Reader" section


[1/7/2024 6:34 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
And not under "User apps"


[1/7/2024 6:34 PM] szybet
.apps folder when connected via usb


[1/7/2024 6:36 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Got it


[1/7/2024 6:37 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Is this on the wiki? Cause I read it but I didn't found this


[1/7/2024 6:37 PM] szybet
nope


[1/7/2024 6:37 PM] szybet
you can add it


[1/7/2024 6:37 PM] szybet
i mean depends on which wiki
on github no, on the site maybe it is


[1/7/2024 6:38 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
I watched both


[1/7/2024 6:38 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Ok then I'll submit a small page as soon as I can


[1/7/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
yea its not hehe... so many specific stuff and not the basic ones

you can copy the wiki from the website to github and add your things


[1/7/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
we are moving to github


[1/7/2024 6:39 PM] szybet
you can convert the wiki format via pandoc i think


[1/7/2024 6:41 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Great


[1/7/2024 6:41 PM] szybet
you can transit all the pages if you want


[1/7/2024 6:41 PM] szybet
and create docs for all things


[1/7/2024 6:41 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[1/7/2024 6:43 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
If you are already planning to do this I think I will only add something, BUT if it is something that you will do in an unspecified future then I can do it


[1/7/2024 6:44 PM] szybet
someone someday will have to do it, but as for now and the near future me and nicolas dont have time to do that soo you can


[1/7/2024 6:45 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Just saying this because with work and hobbies is hard to do more, but if it is something that need to be done from 0% I will reserve some hours in the week to do it


[1/7/2024 6:45 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] haitam-kenwai 
Sounds great


[1/8/2024 11:34 AM] kuratius
Could consider kiwix or similar things to offer offline wikipedia on Kobo out of the box (didnt see it in szybet's list of user apps)


[1/8/2024 11:35 AM] kuratius
Only viable with large sd cards, but may be worth consideration as I dont think default kobo has an option for that


[1/8/2024 11:35 AM] kuratius
and sd cards go up to 1-2TB nowadays

It was first launched to allow offline access to Wikipedia, but has since expanded to include other projects from the Wikimedia Foundation, public domain texts from Project Gutenberg, many of the Stack Exchange sites, and many other resou...

it has a server option too, but idk if that's useful


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] tux_linux
it could probably be ported with some hard work


[1/10/2024 7:20 PM] kuratius
I'm just suggesting that a feature like making it easy to have offline wikipedia on your ereader could be cool and viable since most people who use inkbox replace their sd card anyway


[1/10/2024 7:21 PM] kuratius
doesnt necessarily need kiwix


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] tux_linux
yes
koreader can do that


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] kuratius
does it download single articles or the entire wikipedia?


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] tux_linux
single


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] tux_linux
entire wikipedia is like >100gb?


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] szybet
entire wikipedia -> a few tb


[1/10/2024 7:22 PM] tux_linux
it says 22 gb without images


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] szybet
As of 2 July 2023, the size of the current version of all articles compressed is about 22.14 GB without media.


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] kuratius
without images or with only important article I think it would fit


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] szybet
huh


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] kuratius
it shouldnt be the default because it'd bloat inkbox too much


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] kuratius
but for people with large sd cards it'd be cool


[1/10/2024 7:23 PM] tux_linux
it would be nice to have as an option


[1/10/2024 7:24 PM] kuratius
probably just do something that downloads wikipedia from somewhere and then open it in koreader or something else


[1/10/2024 7:24 PM] kuratius
people can probably already do that


[1/10/2024 7:24 PM] kuratius
but with less overhead would be nice


[1/10/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius
like, less work required from the user is what I mean

Hi guys, trying to install Koreader rn and I can't quite understand how: I downloaded koreader-inkbox-main from github and unzip it in .apps but it doesn't populate "apps.json" and I can't see it under "User's application" on the reader.
Maybe I have to run "create.sh" in inkbox_userapp (in koreader-inkbox-main)?


[1/10/2024 9:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet
how do you upload it to the reader?


[1/10/2024 9:38 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Connect reader with computer (MicroSD is in the reader) -> mount -> unzip in .apps folder


[1/10/2024 9:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
show me the structure of .apps


[1/10/2024 9:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
all the folders and files in it


[1/10/2024 9:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet

[1/10/2024 10:08 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Koreader-inkbox-main folder


[1/10/2024 10:08 PM] szybet
i dont know how you were able to extract it like that

there needs to be an koreader folder and inside of it: app.json, koreader.isa and koreader.isa.dgst


[1/10/2024 10:09 PM] szybet
repair it, you propably have an additionall folder


[1/10/2024 10:09 PM] szybet
koreader folder is in .apps and inside of it the rest of the apps


[1/10/2024 10:13 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
the rest of the files


[1/10/2024 10:13 PM] [matrix] Szybet
my bad


[1/10/2024 10:14 PM] [matrix] Szybet
oof to summarize:
in .apps/koreader must be: app.json, koreader.isa and koreader.isa.dgst


[1/10/2024 10:18 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] haitam-kenwai 
I downloaded the zip from Github, what is the correct way to unzip it?


[1/10/2024 10:18 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai

[matrix] haitam-kenwai 
Ok, downloading this rn and trying


[1/10/2024 10:25 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Uh


[1/10/2024 10:26 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
I have a problem but I think is something related to the SD and not Inkbox itself


[1/10/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
I remove koreader-inkbox-main folder and unzip the correct one (koreader folder with only app.json, koreader.isa and koreader.isa.dgst), I umount the device and koreader still isn't showing up, I reconnect the device and koreader-inkbox-main is still there


[1/10/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
wtf


[1/10/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you unmount it uncorrectly


[1/10/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
incorrectly


[1/10/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
first run sync commannd a few times


[1/10/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
them umount command on the device


[1/10/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Oke, retrying


[1/10/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Never had this problem before


[1/10/2024 10:32 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Still nothing


[1/10/2024 10:32 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Tomorrow I will try with another computer


[1/10/2024 10:32 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Too tired rn


[1/10/2024 10:32 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
