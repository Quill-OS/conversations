@everyone 

This channel will be used to announce big and small things related to the project, mute it if you prefer that

first, 2 new user apps:
- iterm - Qt terminal that works great, better than xorg alternatives, + gomuks cli matrix client works on it
- nachat - a Qt matrix client, ancient but usable, its better than gomuks because images, files, scroll bar etc.

as always, downloadable here:
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/user-applications

Also, soon will be an annoucement relating kobo nia model c, the incompatible one. We have already a working image of inkbox where only battery level / sleep button doesnt work. If someone wants to test further i can send the image. In 2 weeks it should be fully supported

There is huge progress on Clara HD porting; InkBox GUI display and touch (roughly) works now 🥳

I know it is two general pings in one day but I think a lot of you were waiting for this since a long time

New user app, downloadable here as always: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/user-applications

**Syncthing**
from the description: 
Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it’s transmitted over the internet.

Really cool to sync your new books, backup your ereader progress, make your ereader a backup server for small things ;)

Also small note to nachat: It requires above 2.0 gui-bundle, if someone wants it i can provide it, otherwise the app won't launch

@everyone 
As I'm preparing for the final InkBox release this year ( and the next year propably, hopefully not ever? ) I would like to collect some feedback from users, especially reasons why you stopped using InkBox, but other opinions on improvements are also welcome. If you use it you could also reply in some way ( we have no way of tracking how many users we have🥴  )
You can write them to me via private chat or on the #quill channel

Which device in the current Kobo lineup would you like to see ported to InkBox the most? We have got some money from donations but don't know what model to choose.
Thanks

We are looking to get some opinions regarding the future of this project. The most important thing is a name change

InkBox wants your opinion!
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox
https://inkbox.ddns.net/

InkBox OS, the open source ereader OS looks for opinions from their users to know what to focus for in the next release. We are also looking for a name change because there are too many inkbox things now (A youtuber, a tatoo company...)

We are also looking for contributors - If you...

Do you think BlinkOS would be a good name to replace InkBox OS?
