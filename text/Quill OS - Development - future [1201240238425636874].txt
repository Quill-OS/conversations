hello


[1/28/2024 8:04 PM] szybet
1. A new name and a logo, inkbox is no longer original. the 2.0 release showed people are confused because of it
2. change the github organisation name to the one above, without kobo in it
3. get some funding

[1/28/2024 8:05 PM] tux_linux
1. no
2. probably not


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] szybet
first thing i found to get funding


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] tux_linux
open internet? in what way could inkbox help


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] szybet
just looking arround


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] szybet
in the previous funding they gived to not only internet things


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] tux_linux
we do not qualify


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] szybet
https://nlnet.nl/news/2023/20231123-announcing-projects.html


[1/28/2024 8:06 PM] tux_linux
kobo binary blobs are not and will never be open-source


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] szybet
what?


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] szybet
we build everything from source


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] tux_linux
unpartitioned space


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] tux_linux
waveforms


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] tux_linux
false


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] szybet
this is calibration data from the manufacturer


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] szybet
just like bios on an PC is not open source


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] szybet
the same thing


[1/28/2024 8:08 PM] tux_linux
we distribute images with them


[1/28/2024 8:09 PM] szybet
libfprint coppies keys for fingerprint drivers from windows ones if it's needed to communicate with the device


[1/28/2024 8:09 PM] tux_linux
but does it distribute them


[1/28/2024 8:09 PM] szybet
yep


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] szybet
i mean can you stop


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] tux_linux
my vision is: we apply, 99% chance to get refused


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] szybet
whatever


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] szybet
look for a better name


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] tux_linux
what will they do: find something that makes us not qualify


[1/28/2024 8:10 PM] tux_linux
no, i'm sorry but no


[1/28/2024 8:11 PM] szybet
stop being a pessimist


[1/28/2024 8:11 PM] szybet
this complaining is not worth my time


[1/28/2024 8:11 PM] tux_linux
do you have an idea of how many things we would need to change


[1/28/2024 8:11 PM] szybet
the moment inkbox gets more known we will get slapped with a DMCA for that name


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
inkbox is a brand name for a tatoo company


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
accept it, look for a better name


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] tux_linux
are you sure


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] tux_linux
we are not selling anything


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
portal n64 also wasn't


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
but it uses the same name


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
and branding


[1/28/2024 8:12 PM] szybet
the end

[1/28/2024 8:16 PM] szybet
dammit


[1/28/2024 8:16 PM] tux_linux
also, Inkbox tatoo company's name is written as "Inkbox"
we write it as "InkBox"


[1/28/2024 8:16 PM] szybet
stop


[1/28/2024 8:16 PM] szybet
whatever, some day in the future


[1/28/2024 8:18 PM] tux_linux
do you think a tatoo company has the same power as nintendo


[1/28/2024 8:19 PM] szybet
I think they will sting us to death

[1/29/2024 3:54 PM] tux_linux
nice


[1/29/2024 3:57 PM] szybet
they could produce an inkbox ereader


[1/29/2024 3:57 PM] szybet
possibly


[1/29/2024 3:57 PM] tux_linux
i guess we would have high-quality hardware


[1/29/2024 4:02 PM] szybet
an rpi zero
some way to attach the screen
a daugher board for audio jack and battery management and keyboard attachment pins
and a 3d printed case
even i could do that, niaudio was more complicated


[1/29/2024 4:03 PM] tux_linux
and touchscreen


[1/29/2024 4:03 PM] szybet
screen


[1/29/2024 4:04 PM] tux_linux

[1/29/2024 4:04 PM] szybet
screen / touchscreen combo


[1/29/2024 4:04 PM] tux_linux

[1/29/2024 4:06 PM] szybet

[1/29/2024 4:06 PM] tux_linux

[1/29/2024 4:07 PM] tux_linux
300ppi is going to be too expensive i think


[1/29/2024 4:11 PM] szybet
I dont see any with touchscreens

[1/29/2024 4:21 PM] szybet

[1/29/2024 4:22 PM] szybet
this could be a fake site


[1/29/2024 4:23 PM] tux_linux
800x480


[1/29/2024 4:23 PM] tux_linux
its a ridiculous resolution


[1/29/2024 4:25 PM] szybet
yea


[1/29/2024 4:25 PM] szybet
there are none with touch screens


[1/29/2024 8:51 PM] kuratius
they're not actually fake, they're just shit


[1/29/2024 8:51 PM] kuratius
dont even have prices listed for most things


[1/29/2024 8:51 PM] kuratius
I bought something from them and it didnt work with their code examples


[1/29/2024 8:53 PM] kuratius
the open book project uses a screen from them, and they allegedly also offer touch screen and front light options but of course there isnt a price listed

But not that bad

pm me your gmail


[2/12/2024 12:23 AM] nonridiculousadjective
just submitted an entry, the owl looks nice but i am thinking it could be cleaned up a little bit, so i could look into it in inscape, not promising anything though


[2/12/2024 12:23 AM] nonridiculousadjective
and being a slovak, a bit of slavic languages in names like these gives it a nice charm :)


[2/12/2024 12:24 AM] tux_linux
thanks


[2/12/2024 11:12 AM] szybet
As for the result for now the owl will just be a puppet, so yea - you can modify it but its important for it to still look like its made from ink


[2/12/2024 1:27 PM] tux_linux
im sorry but our default fonts are awesome

the fact that he brags about arch isn't helping


[2/12/2024 1:30 PM] szybet
If he joins and helps us improve, then fine


[2/12/2024 1:30 PM] szybet
if he just complains, not cool


[2/12/2024 1:31 PM] tux_linux
u001 is a great font


[2/12/2024 1:46 PM] szybet
@Zoli your logo will propably win, so you can already make it better / svg


[2/12/2024 1:46 PM] szybet
and your name too, inkos


[2/12/2024 1:55 PM] tux_linux
im sorry but I don't like the ink splash logo


[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] szybet
do you have something better


[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] szybet

[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] tux_linux
a reader with an ink bottle in it


[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] tux_linux
not an ink splash


[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] szybet
yea, still cool


[2/12/2024 1:56 PM] szybet

Posting about every inkbox release on kobo subreddit was fine, but posting a question about "what features would you like" got my post removed, I complained calling it a stupid decission not making sense and making the argument i made here, the mod got offended ant thats it

[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
I like it


[2/12/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
Maybe the bottle inside and the feather outside of the device


[2/12/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
And a bit of text on the device


[2/12/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
Like lines but cant be read


[2/12/2024 8:59 PM] zoli111
okay


[2/12/2024 9:08 PM] szybet
Maybe a website redesign? With readme redesign too


[2/12/2024 9:09 PM] szybet
I can into basic webdev but bad into design


[2/12/2024 9:23 PM] tux_linux
I like it more skeuomorphic like that
well, maybe not *that* skeuomorphic, but a little bit maybe, with visible ink inside and a more rounded form


[2/12/2024 9:23 PM] tux_linux
but thanks for your sketch


[2/12/2024 9:49 PM] zoli111
do you want it with or without a a device?


[2/12/2024 9:53 PM] szybet
With


[2/12/2024 9:53 PM] szybet

NO


[2/12/2024 10:23 PM] szybet
Logo shouldnt have a text


[2/12/2024 10:23 PM] szybet
Logo should be an addition to the text


[2/12/2024 10:24 PM] szybet
If you make it too small it wont be visible

it's soo cool


[2/14/2024 8:54 PM] tux_linux
Don't forget there is a progress bar

its upside down


[2/14/2024 9:30 PM] szybet
why


[2/14/2024 9:30 PM] tux_linux
idk


[2/14/2024 9:30 PM] tux_linux
previous inkbox logo didnt have s in it


[2/14/2024 9:34 PM] zoli111
what font does the website header use?

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/inkbox-web-D03F2.png


[2/14/2024 9:36 PM] tux_linux
its fraunces


[2/14/2024 9:36 PM] tux_linux
but with that S it's better to choose another one
or edit the font so that the S is not upside-down


[2/14/2024 9:37 PM] zoli111
I don't think so


[2/14/2024 9:38 PM] zoli111
the n looks different


[2/14/2024 9:38 PM] tux_linux
i know


[2/14/2024 9:38 PM] tux_linux
fraunces has two n's
but there is a spirit that decides which n to display


[2/14/2024 9:38 PM] tux_linux
never figured out why


[2/14/2024 9:39 PM] tux_linux
on the device boot logo it's the stranger n


[2/14/2024 9:39 PM] tux_linux
no, it was


[2/14/2024 9:40 PM] tux_linux
it changed to the n from the website header when I made fbink print text


[2/14/2024 9:40 PM] tux_linux
and stopped using the c binary that was displaying the logo


[2/14/2024 9:42 PM] szybet
change the font...


[2/14/2024 9:43 PM] zoli111
will the ui display the font or should it be part of the image?

[2/15/2024 5:25 PM] zoli111

[2/15/2024 5:25 PM] zoli111
are these lines placeholders?


[2/15/2024 5:26 PM] szybet
no, just fancy lines

[2/18/2024 1:47 PM] zoli111
QuillOS could be reconsidered


[2/18/2024 1:47 PM] szybet
you would need to redesign the logo for a feather ;D


[2/18/2024 1:48 PM] zoli111

Magic Frame : Turn Everything into a Touch Area
This tutorial is about helping people to build their own touch screen solution based on any flat screen TV. It uses light triangulation technology to read the coordinates. This method is quite cheap ( the priciest part is the TV), with a good quality image and you can make the table almost as small and as thin as your TV is.

Of course, nothing ...

[3/17/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
and most other people who talked in this chat will say that too, I will force it


[3/17/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
force it as for "pwease change the github organisation name"


[3/17/2024 6:27 PM] szybet
🥴


[3/17/2024 6:40 PM] mintpilo
Maybe instead of simply ink, in the name inkbox, elude more subtly to the history of ink, as a potential tree of names, this is an OS for eink devices, so maybe that can be emphasised


[3/17/2024 6:40 PM] mintpilo
GallOS, perhaps?


[3/17/2024 6:40 PM] mintpilo
eGall?


[3/17/2024 6:40 PM] szybet
What does Gall mean


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] mintpilo
Iron Gall is an older method for making ink

Iron gall ink
Iron gall ink (also known as common ink, standard ink, oak gall ink or iron gall nut ink) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources. It was the standard ink formulation used in Europe for the 1400-year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th ...

[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] kuratius
is using just BoxOS possible?


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] zoli111
There was an old suggestion, EinkOS


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] mintpilo
Slightly too generic


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] mintpilo
But it's a start of an idea


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] kuratius
cause, you know, this is the Box project discord


[3/17/2024 6:41 PM] szybet
also listen, https://github.com/Blink-OS An OS from 2020 that doesn't even list on google, 3 people worked on it doesn't matter :)


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] mintpilo
Though, keeping it simple is not horrible


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] szybet
most generic name ever ;/


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] mintpilo
GallBox


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] szybet
InkOS is taken sooo maybe not


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] mintpilo
Though "Gall" dosen't sound the most pleasant so idk if I really feel it either


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] szybet
Where BlinkOS might be not understand at first glance, this won't for sure...


[3/17/2024 6:42 PM] szybet
yea


[3/17/2024 6:43 PM] szybet
but good thinking


[3/17/2024 6:43 PM] mintpilo
Sometimes not immediately understandable but memorable can work, especially if it's related to like the product here, or is a fun nod to the history or whatever led to this product


[3/17/2024 6:44 PM] mintpilo
Could also reference the history of the printing press


[3/17/2024 6:44 PM] szybet
well yes, bluetooth


[3/17/2024 6:44 PM] szybet
Maybe BlinkBox @tux-linux


[3/17/2024 6:44 PM] szybet
for remaining something from inkbox


[3/17/2024 6:45 PM] szybet
just Bl+

SheetOS xd

[3/17/2024 6:45 PM] mintpilo
Idk I'm not big on Blink, though I am just a bystander, of course


[3/17/2024 6:45 PM] mintpilo
Well, current eink tech is "carta" which is a form of document


[3/17/2024 6:45 PM] mintpilo
LetterOS


[3/17/2024 6:45 PM] mintpilo
Nah, idk


[3/17/2024 6:46 PM] mintpilo
I feel like you guys are also commited to the *Box ecosystem of names


[3/17/2024 6:46 PM] mintpilo
And LetterBox is defintely no


[3/17/2024 6:46 PM] szybet
BlinkBox OS :D


[3/17/2024 6:46 PM] tux_linux
bee bop os


[3/17/2024 6:46 PM] szybet

[3/17/2024 6:47 PM] szybet

[3/17/2024 6:48 PM] szybet
names can be funny


[3/17/2024 6:49 PM] szybet
well many people voted already


[3/17/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
@tux-linux decide


[3/17/2024 6:50 PM] tux_linux
none


[3/17/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
so zoli can cook a new logo if he feels like it, but the current on is good too


[3/17/2024 6:50 PM] szybet
so Blink OS, good


[3/17/2024 6:50 PM] tux_linux

~~I'm actually kind of fond of the first thing I came up with, which is GallOS, but I'm not part of this project~~


[3/17/2024 6:52 PM] tux_linux
im just not sure people will know what it is about unless they google it


[3/17/2024 6:52 PM] szybet
we obviously will advertise it as "open source ereader os"


[3/17/2024 6:53 PM] mintpilo
First thing that unfortunately might come to mind is "gall blader"?


[3/17/2024 6:53 PM] mintpilo
So that tilts me to no


[3/17/2024 6:53 PM] mintpilo
Even on that


[3/17/2024 6:53 PM] szybet
so it will as searchable as inkbox, even better because googling inkbox won't show tatoos...


[3/17/2024 6:54 PM] mintpilo
CodexOS


[3/17/2024 6:54 PM] tux_linux
out of context
i think


[3/17/2024 6:54 PM] tux_linux
might have been good for something else

Just decide on something, any name, there have been soo many propositions. I'm slowly sick of it, this project doesn't have a serious future without a name change and as you see I'm working for this serious future so please just choose a name.

A new name will also make it much easier to search for


[3/23/2024 6:59 PM] spagettioso
Currently all that comes up when searching inkbox is tattoo garbage


[3/23/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
and we can be dmcad for it


[3/23/2024 7:37 PM] szybet
out of github and google


[3/23/2024 7:38 PM] szybet
so please you people complain to nicolas as i do


[3/24/2024 12:24 AM] zoli111
I know it was rejected multiple times, but I still support QuillOS because
- unique
- short
- related to "ink"
So I made a quick logo sketch

[3/24/2024 1:00 AM] tux_linux
programming random inkbox parts at 2am


[3/24/2024 1:00 AM] szybet
I do not have that time


[3/24/2024 1:00 AM] szybet
I should study more


[3/24/2024 1:01 AM] tux_linux
well


[3/24/2024 1:01 AM] szybet
so it's a problem


[3/24/2024 1:01 AM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/24/2024 1:01 AM] tux_linux
at your dismay, it seems i separate inkbox *too* well from school stuff


[3/24/2024 1:01 AM] szybet
🥴


[3/24/2024 1:02 AM] tux_linux
of course if rtc has problems and its a watch, then yea, its a problem


[3/24/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
its a cheaper and more efficient IC, but its fucking drifting so what's the point


[3/24/2024 1:03 AM] szybet
SQFMI is an idiot


[3/24/2024 1:04 AM] tux_linux
great


[3/24/2024 1:04 AM] szybet
could this be the official logo? it has comic sans vibes and i like it


[3/24/2024 1:37 AM] tux_linux
well, i find it ugly


[3/24/2024 1:37 AM] tux_linux
its a good design


[3/24/2024 1:37 AM] tux_linux
but needs to become more than a draft

[3/24/2024 10:43 AM] szybet
@Xsf_Nrg_4fr We settled up for QuillOS, you can start looking for a domain for it


[3/24/2024 10:44 AM] szybet
:D


[3/24/2024 10:44 AM] szybet
@tux-linux can i rename the github org?


[3/24/2024 10:44 AM] szybet
also, think about how the main program will now be named


[3/24/2024 10:44 AM] szybet
just Quill?


[3/24/2024 10:46 AM] szybet
also think about a Quill organisation name as QuillOS is taken


[3/24/2024 10:47 AM] szybet
every name is taked to be exact


[3/24/2024 10:47 AM] szybet
QuillEreaders, QuillPeople, QuillOrg for example, many organizations do that


[3/24/2024 10:59 AM] zoli111
QuillOS.org and Quill-OS is free


[3/24/2024 11:00 AM] szybet
where do you check for domains?


[3/24/2024 11:00 AM] zoli111
I meant GH organization


[3/24/2024 11:00 AM] zoli111
@Szybet


[3/24/2024 11:01 AM] zoli111
they are not taken


[3/24/2024 11:01 AM] szybet
ah


[3/24/2024 11:02 AM] zoli111
for domain name, this is the cheapest I found
https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=quillos


[3/24/2024 4:51 PM] tux_linux
quill.os


[3/24/2024 4:51 PM] tux_linux
no
dangerous


[3/24/2024 4:51 PM] tux_linux
not now


[3/24/2024 4:52 PM] tux_linux
oh, you cant name it like that it seems


[3/24/2024 4:53 PM] tux_linux
quillos.org maybe


[3/24/2024 4:55 PM] szybet
you dont choose a domain name, the price dictates it ;p


[3/24/2024 4:55 PM] szybet
decide on a name


[3/24/2024 4:55 PM] szybet
at least


[3/24/2024 4:59 PM] tux_linux
quillos.org


[3/25/2024 1:10 AM] xsf_nrg_4fr
I'll grab it in the next day or two, if that's what you guys want to go with for a domain. I like the name by the way!


[3/25/2024 1:11 AM] tux_linux
thanks a lot!


[3/25/2024 1:21 AM] xsf_nrg_4fr
Which of these is better?
quill-os.org
quillos.org

I kind of like the hyphen.


[3/25/2024 1:21 AM] tux_linux
idk


[3/25/2024 1:22 AM] tux_linux
might be better w/ hyphen


[3/25/2024 1:26 AM] xsf_nrg_4fr
I think it's more legible that way, and easier on the eyes... But make a decision and I'll grab it!


[3/25/2024 1:26 AM] tux_linux
with hyphen


[3/25/2024 1:26 AM] tux_linux
thanks


[3/25/2024 1:27 AM] xsf_nrg_4fr
Fantastic


[3/25/2024 6:25 AM] zoli111
Why did you change your mind?


[3/25/2024 6:25 AM] zoli111
I think it's simply easier to type without the hyphen


[3/25/2024 7:22 AM] szybet
The domain with the hyphen, not the official name


[3/25/2024 7:23 AM] zoli111
I know, but hyphenless version is also available


[3/25/2024 7:25 AM] zoli111
Nvm probably makes more sense using hyphen


[3/25/2024 7:26 AM] zoli111

[3/25/2024 12:58 PM] xsf_nrg_4fr

It doesnt need to match

[3/25/2024 1:51 PM] tux_linux

QUL_TEST could also work if you don't want the confusion
