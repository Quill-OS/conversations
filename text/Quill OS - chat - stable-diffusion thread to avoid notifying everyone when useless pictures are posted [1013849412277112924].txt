So I wanted a "man drowned by kitties" and instead I typed "man drawn by kitties". There you go

[8/29/2022 7:24 PM] tux_linux

[8/29/2022 7:35 PM] aryetis

Nice logs ...


[8/29/2022 7:36 PM] tux_linux

[8/29/2022 7:36 PM] tux_linux
without your display manager


[8/29/2022 7:36 PM] tux_linux
now it works for me on kde but initially I had to use it in tty

[8/29/2022 7:39 PM] tux_linux
i think you need to set memory settings for wsl


[8/29/2022 7:39 PM] aryetis
hmmmmmmm what


[8/29/2022 7:43 PM] aryetis

🤨

been fighting for 10 minutes with stable-diffusion, anaconda and some advanced gui... Turns out the path is hardcoded to the default installation folder. I'm gonna break something... or someone.

[8/29/2022 9:47 PM] aryetis
well at least they give us the option to add our own custom path... but this error message --" wow


[8/29/2022 10:16 PM] aryetis
Welp anyways, using this repo <https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion-webui> (still running on Nvidia GPU) I hit 5it/s whereas before using the GRisk GUI I was averaging at 3it/s and sometimes was hitting 5.
Also now I've got access to img2img (still don't know how to make it works tho), GFPGAN for better faces, and RealESRGAN for upscaling.


[8/29/2022 10:20 PM] tux_linux
great


[8/29/2022 10:22 PM] aryetis
I can loopback the output to the entry ! Yes oh that's so cool
7it/s using k_dpm_2 😮


[8/29/2022 10:27 PM] aryetis
I figured out img2img

The Joy of Algorithms, With Bot Ross
Hi there friends, today I bring you a new kind of video, "The Joy of Algorithms" with Bot Ross.  In this video I use stable diffusion to create different kinds of art very quickly.  You can download stable diffusion to your desktop at the links below

1080 TI?


[9/4/2022 9:36 PM] szybet
so maybe 1050TI will be not that bad?


[9/4/2022 9:36 PM] tux_linux
how much vram


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] szybet
11 GB


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
yes, 1080ti is ok


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
1050ti has 4 right?


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
oom for you there


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] szybet
yea


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] szybet
crap


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
you can try on your cpu


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
it works


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
it's just a bit slower


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] szybet
how to add these 30


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
instead of 4 secs it's 10 minutes


[9/4/2022 9:37 PM] tux_linux
but it's still bearable


[9/4/2022 9:38 PM] tux_linux
?


[9/4/2022 9:38 PM] szybet
to 1050 ;p


[9/4/2022 9:39 PM] tux_linux
these 30 what


[9/4/2022 9:39 PM] tux_linux
oh, to 1080


[9/4/2022 9:39 PM] szybet
number


[9/4/2022 9:39 PM] szybet
a joke


[9/4/2022 9:39 PM] tux_linux
i guess you got to buy a new one...


[9/4/2022 9:40 PM] szybet
and resolder it to the laptop


[9/4/2022 9:40 PM] szybet
🥴


[9/4/2022 10:39 PM] aryetis
I mean I already told that it can run on 4gb if you tweak it <https://rentry.org/GUItard>  . But yeah it's a coin flip.

necrobumping. I've found this lora that is probably helpful if you're still experimenting with SD to get a logo for Inkbox :p

I might install it tomorrow and see what I can get out of it.


[5/6/2023 3:11 AM] aryetis
I've spent way too much time on SD so feel free to ask me anything btw.
