hi


[2/11/2021 12:38 AM] the.mightydill
hi


[2/11/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
so is it OK? any things I should set up?


[2/11/2021 12:38 AM] the.mightydill
i think give me admin (just right click) and i could help set this up


[2/11/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/11/2021 12:39 AM] the.mightydill
i'm pretty good with discord


[2/11/2021 12:39 AM] tux_linux
done; you can give me admin back when you're finished?


[2/11/2021 12:39 AM] tux_linux
thx


[2/11/2021 12:40 AM] the.mightydill
sure


[2/11/2021 12:41 AM] tux_linux
maybe change #deleted-channel for #kobox-dev ?


[2/11/2021 12:41 AM] the.mightydill
sure


[2/11/2021 12:41 AM] tux_linux
seems more friendly, at least from what I can say


[2/11/2021 12:41 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/11/2021 12:41 AM] tux_linux
that's good; should we have alias like in Mobileread?


[2/11/2021 12:42 AM] the.mightydill
sure


[2/11/2021 12:42 AM] the.mightydill
(Dill is my nickname in real life, haha)


[2/11/2021 12:42 AM] tux_linux
ok so you can rename me "NiMa" if you want


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
although I'd like tux-linux


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
oh you set the locale, I saw that


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
locale?


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
hmm language


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
time format, etc


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
really


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
i didn't know


[2/11/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
idk, the times changed from 18 h 43 to 18:43


[2/11/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
anyways


[2/11/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
I'll 'init' some of the channels


[2/11/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
sure


[2/11/2021 12:47 AM] tux_linux
I think we're done, what do you think?


[2/11/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/11/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
nice


[2/11/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
i added all those to the channel topic


[2/11/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux

Hello! Sorry I've been pretty absent the left week or so; work has suddenly gotten crazy busy


[2/11/2021 12:53 AM] tux_linux
don't worry; it's ok!


[2/11/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
no problem at all!


[2/11/2021 12:54 AM] tux_linux
beforehand you could go check what happened in the kobox channel in Mobileread server; a lot of things since last week


[2/11/2021 1:18 AM] tux_linux
this is awesome

Hi @OfficerAction ! I didn't have the time to test your touch script yet, but I'll do tonight as I'm setting up things on a new Kobo


[2/13/2021 12:30 AM] officeraction.
hey there


[2/13/2021 12:30 AM] tux_linux
also, I'll send you screenshots of Falkon working on a Kobo Aura
surely, QtWebEngine is possible in there


[2/13/2021 12:30 AM] officeraction.
no problem there is no rush


[2/13/2021 12:30 AM] tux_linux
not at all, I've got time tonight


[2/13/2021 12:31 AM] officeraction.
thats cool how did you get it to run?


[2/13/2021 12:31 AM] officeraction.
falkon i mean


[2/13/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
by installing alpine 3.11 in a chroot with Xorg and x11vnc + fbink-xdamage + touch


[2/13/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
I'll send you a screenshot soon, I just need to get it installed and started


[2/13/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
I'll try youtube as in the Glo HD too


[2/13/2021 12:32 AM] officeraction.
i tried with the alpine image from the forum but it didn't work there...


[2/13/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
on what Kobo?


[2/13/2021 12:32 AM] officeraction.
well maybe i just have to reinstall everything and it will work somehow 😄


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] officeraction.
KA1


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] tux_linux
year?


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] tux_linux
oh 2017 is it?


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] tux_linux
won't work


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] tux_linux
firefox worked though (though it crashed every time you did something)


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] officeraction.
yea


[2/13/2021 12:33 AM] officeraction.
it fills up the memory imidiately


[2/13/2021 12:34 AM] officeraction.
only 500mb and firefox is a memory hog


[2/13/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
chromium works though


[2/13/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
but on kobos that support it


[2/13/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
I tried to build Palemoon for it, but it's not an easy task and my Raspberry Pi ran out of memory the other day


[2/13/2021 12:35 AM] officeraction.
maybe cross compiling is the way to go 😉


[2/13/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
I don't have the skills to do that...


[2/13/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
it uses a custom build system (mach) that I know nothing about


[2/13/2021 12:36 AM] officeraction.
i will take a look if there is an easy way to set it up for alpine these days


[2/13/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
it's already pretty complicated to get it compiling natively


[2/13/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
yeah thx


[2/13/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
huh... Falkon doesn't work on the Aura


[2/13/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
but Chromium did


[2/13/2021 12:37 AM] officeraction.
btw do you have one of the mark7 kobos?


[2/13/2021 12:37 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/13/2021 12:37 AM] tux_linux

could you test something for me? I am working on something and want to make sure it works on all models.


[2/13/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/13/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
I also have mark 4 and mark 5 + mark 6


[2/13/2021 12:39 AM] officeraction.
ok i will prepare it


[2/13/2021 12:52 AM] tux_linux
ok summary from my tests with falkon...
it seems that it has the same bug on the Aura than it did on the Libra, but running chromium is fine. Falkon was confirmed working on the Glo HD so far. Chromium fails to run on the Libra, but runs on the Mini

[2/13/2021 12:56 AM] officeraction.
can you check the memory usage?


[2/13/2021 12:56 AM] officeraction.
you can see it with htop


[2/13/2021 12:59 AM] tux_linux
actually it crashed before I could do anything


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
like, the whole Kobo wasn't responding to anything even SSH


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] officeraction.
oh well too bad


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
but you know


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
256 mb ram


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] officeraction.
yea...


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
will retry now


[2/13/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
i'll also check if there are lighter alternatives other than falkon


[2/13/2021 1:02 AM] tux_linux
there seems to be qutebrowser ...
it's not in the repos before v3.12 though
but I'll give it a shot compiled natively on the Kobo


[2/13/2021 1:02 AM] tux_linux
(if I can)


[2/13/2021 1:02 AM] officeraction.
also based on qt


[2/13/2021 1:02 AM] officeraction.
it might work


[2/13/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
yep that's why I chose it


[2/13/2021 1:11 AM] officeraction.
do you have nickelmenu installed?


[2/13/2021 1:11 AM] the.mightydill
wooooo

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] officeraction.
Ok i would like you to test this app. Just extract it to the .adds folder on your kobo and then you can start it with nickelmenu.

what does it do?


[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] officeraction.
if it works it should just show a picture on the screen


[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] officeraction.
if it doesnt it will write to a logfile


[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] tux_linux
then I expect the failure rate to be pretty high


[2/13/2021 1:15 AM] tux_linux
drawing to the framebuffer wasn't a good experience, at least for me


[2/13/2021 1:16 AM] the.mightydill

[2/13/2021 1:16 AM] tux_linux
who knows?


[2/13/2021 1:16 AM] tux_linux
ok I'll test it now


[2/13/2021 1:19 AM] tux_linux
hmm didn't work
I was in landscape mode though


[2/13/2021 1:20 AM] tux_linux
in portrait it didn't work either


[2/13/2021 1:20 AM] officeraction.
hmm


[2/13/2021 1:20 AM] tux_linux
I'll check the log

[2/13/2021 1:21 AM] officeraction.
ok thanks a lot!!


[2/13/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
maybe you chose the wrong memory address?


[2/13/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
maybe it changes between devices?


[2/13/2021 1:21 AM] officeraction.
yea


[2/13/2021 1:22 AM] officeraction.
the problem is the newer kobos use a different version of the pxp engine


[2/13/2021 1:23 AM] tux_linux
ok you went really down to the low-level
I love it


[2/13/2021 1:24 AM] officeraction.
yea i like to experiment with stuff like that


[2/13/2021 1:24 AM] tux_linux
I wanted to do that myself but I chose FBInk instead because I don't have the skills to go that deep in the hardware


[2/13/2021 1:24 AM] officeraction.
you can sqeeze out a bit more performance when using that but as you can see.... problems


[2/13/2021 1:24 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/13/2021 1:25 AM] tux_linux
but I've had more headaches than that when trying to emulate Nickel in a virtual machine


[2/13/2021 1:25 AM] tux_linux
3 weeks of my life wasted on trying to get touch input working


[2/13/2021 1:25 AM] officeraction.
i can imagine 😄


[2/13/2021 1:25 AM] tux_linux
and it didn't work at the end sadly


[2/13/2021 1:26 AM] officeraction.
too bad but sometimes its like that

[2/13/2021 1:27 AM] tux_linux
But even after discussing with geek1011, NiLuJe and sherman on GitHub we couldn't find out the way to get it work


[2/13/2021 1:28 AM] officeraction.
do you have a link?


[2/13/2021 1:28 AM] tux_linux
hmm yeah I'll PM you


[2/13/2021 1:28 AM] officeraction.
maybe i will also waste some time 😄

@OfficerAction would it be useful if I provided you the logs of Chromium/Falkon crashing on my Libra?

maybe. I can take a look 😉


[2/13/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
ok will send them to you soon, as soon as I get them crashing ^^


[2/13/2021 4:14 PM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction here are the logs for Falkon, it's an strace dump because it wasn't very verbose, and it starts where it tries to render a webpage but the render engine crashes

it did that on the working kobos too


[2/13/2021 4:19 PM] tux_linux
although I'm going to verify just for sure


[2/13/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
:D


[2/13/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
what browser?


[2/13/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
chromium


[2/13/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
v81


[2/13/2021 4:55 PM] the.mightydill
nice


[2/13/2021 4:57 PM] tux_linux
What would you suggest to repair that?


[2/13/2021 5:03 PM] officeraction.
Well the soc the kobos are using actually do not support GL or EGL. So you would have to force a software renderer somehow. But no idea how to do that or if it is even possible. Acually I wonder why it's working for the old devices at all.


[2/13/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction ok, here you go with the chromium log on the Libra:

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-A16BE.txt


[2/13/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
the UI loads, but trying to load a webpage returns an "Aw, Snap!" error everytime


[2/13/2021 6:23 PM] officeraction.
for falkon you could try falkon --no-sandbox --disable-gpu


[2/13/2021 6:23 PM] tux_linux
I tried that with Chromium
no luck


[2/13/2021 6:24 PM] tux_linux
I'm retrying now with the version in the 3.11 repo


[2/13/2021 6:25 PM] tux_linux
just tried with Falkon, didn't work either


[2/13/2021 6:25 PM] officeraction.
well than i'm also out of ideas


[2/13/2021 6:25 PM] tux_linux
Maybe the older boards have something that the newer ones don't have?


[2/13/2021 6:27 PM] officeraction.
i thought so too but what could it be?


[2/13/2021 6:28 PM] tux_linux
I don't know, really...


[2/13/2021 6:28 PM] officeraction.
I checked and they all don't have a integrated gpu so no opengl


[2/13/2021 6:28 PM] tux_linux
but why does it work so well on older models then?


[2/13/2021 6:29 PM] tux_linux
like chromium is 500x faster than Firefox


[2/13/2021 6:29 PM] officeraction.
magic

probably ... ^^


[2/13/2021 6:29 PM] tux_linux
maybe it's a hidden feature, like if they didn't disclose it?


[2/13/2021 6:31 PM] tux_linux
what data sheet did you look at?

[2/13/2021 6:32 PM] tux_linux
the newer ones seem to have a gpu though


[2/13/2021 6:32 PM] officeraction.
some of them have


[2/13/2021 6:33 PM] officeraction.
but not the ones that kobo uses


[2/13/2021 6:33 PM] tux_linux
maybe that it's that, the problem? if the newer ones have a GPU... then it's not compatible with Chromium rendering backend
and for those who don't have one, software rendering works flawlessly


[2/13/2021 6:33 PM] officeraction.
the newer ones use imx6sl and imx6sll they also dont have that


[2/13/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
oh

there. It lists all the hardware with imx6xxx
seems that it broke when imx6sll came, because my Glo HD (imx6sl) worked with falkon and chromium

maybe it's not fatal, just a harmless warning
... don't know


[2/13/2021 7:02 PM] officeraction.
it has many causes to fail


[2/13/2021 7:02 PM] officeraction.
maybe out of memory?


[2/13/2021 7:02 PM] tux_linux
hmm
unlikely, it ran fine on the Aura with 256MB of ram

[2/13/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
seems there are differences between devices


[2/13/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux

or try qutebrowser, it'll tell you if your Kobo has the rendering issue

If yes, I will start to try


[2/13/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
well it is supported, OfficerAction tested it with its Aura One


[2/13/2021 7:32 PM] tux_linux

Other than QtWebEngine, WebKitGTK and Gecko, are there other decent rendering engines that we could use?


[2/13/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
(and that would work)


[2/13/2021 8:58 PM] officeraction.
qtwebengine uses chromium under the hood and these are all the decent ones afaik 😉

any way to prevent Gecko from running out of ram (and make it faster) then?

on the Kindle


[2/13/2021 9:21 PM] tux_linux
I didn't want to wear out too much the eMMC, so I squashfs-ed the image and set up a loop device on the kindle. Then I mounted some essential tmpfs so something can be "wrote" in the chroot.
It's awesome that the Kindle's kernel support Squashfs. It would be awesome if Kobo added that to their eReaders


[2/13/2021 9:28 PM] officeraction.
damn that seems to work relly well

[2/13/2021 9:30 PM] tux_linux
so I think we did a monstrous job getting that to work on Kobos


[2/13/2021 10:01 PM] officeraction.
its true its a ton of work


[2/13/2021 10:01 PM] officeraction.
i have it running now


[2/13/2021 10:02 PM] officeraction.
but how can i customize mate-panel


[2/13/2021 10:02 PM] officeraction.
i want the fancy background from the forum image 😉

[2/13/2021 10:25 PM] tux_linux
that's good news


[2/13/2021 10:26 PM] tux_linux
so we can add the KA1 to the "completely-supported" list


[2/13/2021 10:26 PM] tux_linux
that means you'll be able to run chromium (but honestly, stay with Falkon; it is faster)

but regarding the error, I don't do that much cross-compilation for my Kobo, if I had to compile Dropbear I'd have did it natively in an Alpine chroot, static build


[2/13/2021 11:16 PM] officeraction.
^ this


[2/13/2021 11:16 PM] officeraction.
you can just use his alreay compiled stuff


[2/13/2021 11:17 PM] officeraction.
and if you want to get into crosscompiling you should setup a modern toolchain the one in the blogpost is outdated


[2/13/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
I'd go with koxtoolchain or NickelTC

[2/13/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/13/2021 11:18 PM] tux_linux
I built the emulator kernel using NickelTC


[2/13/2021 11:19 PM] ferminolaiz
I was using the newer version, though


[2/13/2021 11:19 PM] tux_linux
that's why it did cause you a problem


[2/13/2021 11:19 PM] ferminolaiz
But anyways I'll try to get a toolchain working on the kobo itself


[2/13/2021 11:19 PM] tux_linux
Alpine


[2/13/2021 11:19 PM] tux_linux
`apk add gcc`


[2/13/2021 11:20 PM] ferminolaiz
Is there any specific reason why I should use the chroot?


[2/13/2021 11:20 PM] tux_linux
*package manager*


[2/13/2021 11:20 PM] tux_linux
but yes, you mean "why couldn't I just unpack the minirootfs in the root of my Kobo?"


[2/13/2021 11:20 PM] ferminolaiz
Sort of, yeah


[2/13/2021 11:21 PM] ferminolaiz
Or at least make a selection/mix of both things


[2/13/2021 11:21 PM] tux_linux
it breaks musl-libc compatibility and it doesn't work well *at all*


[2/13/2021 11:21 PM] ferminolaiz
neeevermind


[2/13/2021 11:21 PM] tux_linux
but yea, compiling is OK on Kobos. Not the fastest you'll ever see, but it's... usable


[2/13/2021 11:22 PM] tux_linux
e.g. Natively compiling FBInk takes about 8 mins


[2/13/2021 11:22 PM] ferminolaiz
it's an ssh server, shouldn't be too bad


[2/13/2021 11:22 PM] tux_linux
yep
I suggest you either make a static binary or you tell the compiler to use a bind-mounted sysroot (the real Kobo's root)


[2/13/2021 11:25 PM] tux_linux
also, you'd be stuck with the 256MB of storage the rootfs partition has (unless you grow up the space)


[2/13/2021 11:25 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, that's on the list too


[2/13/2021 11:25 PM] ferminolaiz
(of things to do)


[2/13/2021 11:40 PM] tux_linux
also, do you think it would be great to have a service manager on Kobos? Like `start <service>` and `stop <service>`? Kindles have one and it's awesome


[2/13/2021 11:42 PM] officeraction.
well what kind of services would you want to run?


[2/13/2021 11:43 PM] tux_linux
maybe an http server, or some X server if we can manage to "merge" the Alpine and the stock rootfs

[2/14/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
(although it would probably work with Kobos like the Glo HD and the Aura One)


[2/14/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
😮


[2/14/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
AWESOME


[2/14/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
Yep, and it's even FAST


[2/14/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
should not be as fast on the Mini though


[2/14/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
but I almost got it working on the Aura, which has the same RAM


[2/14/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
nice!

yep
I'm searching for a way to tell Firefox to eat up less RAM


[2/14/2021 7:32 PM] tux_linux
but not having so much success so far


[2/14/2021 8:29 PM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction did you look into cross compiling Palemoon?


[2/14/2021 8:38 PM] officeraction.
hey well it has quite a bit of dependencies:
gtk2 dbus-glib desktop-file-utils libxt mime-types 
alsa-lib startup-notification python2 autoconf2.13 unzip zip yasm 
libpulse 
you would have to cross compile all of them first  and judging from my experience you have to fiddle around for a while almost every time. unfortunately my free time is limited😅


[2/14/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
Hmm yeah...
I'll try anyway, because webkitgtk is garbage on kobos


[2/14/2021 8:53 PM] officeraction.
go for it!


[2/14/2021 9:08 PM] tux_linux
yep, I'll try to compile it on an emulated Debian virtual machine with 8192MB of RAM
(even on the Pi, it didn't want to compile because it lacked memory)


[2/14/2021 9:10 PM] tux_linux
also, the developers were kind enough to set up a script that wraps the thing with all required dependencies in a tgz
but do you think compiling with glibc instead of musl-libc will render it incompatible with Alpine?


[2/14/2021 9:39 PM] officeraction.
yes it wont be compatible. if you compile for glibc the programs will specifically look for that and if it's not there it wont run.


[2/14/2021 9:39 PM] tux_linux
oh so I should set up an Alpine Linux VM then?


[2/14/2021 9:39 PM] officeraction.
maybe that would be the easiest solution


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] officeraction.
oh wait maybe that wont make life easier because you still have to crosscompile


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] tux_linux
alpine vm


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] tux_linux
qemu-system-arm


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] officeraction.
uhhm


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] tux_linux
but is there a way to do it with debian? It's installing right now


[2/14/2021 9:41 PM] officeraction.
it should work but it wont be very fast i think


[2/14/2021 9:42 PM] tux_linux
of course not


[2/14/2021 9:42 PM] tux_linux
won't matter, really
if it finishes compiling in 2 weeks, we'll be lucky


[2/14/2021 9:43 PM] officeraction.
there are 2 ways musl offers some way to set it up directly


[2/14/2021 9:44 PM] officeraction.
maybe you should try that i am also curious how well that works

musl libc - Getting started


[2/14/2021 9:44 PM] tux_linux
hmm yep
I'll have to figure out how to pass it to the mozconfig or mach build system


[2/14/2021 9:45 PM] officeraction.
make TARGET=arm-linux-musleabihf GCC_CONFIG="--with-arch=armv7-a --with-fpu=vfpv3-d16"


[2/14/2021 9:45 PM] officeraction.
try that


[2/14/2021 9:46 PM] tux_linux
hmm no
for palemoon it's something like
`mach build`
and all lives in the`.mozconfig` file


[2/14/2021 9:46 PM] officeraction.
thats for the toolchain


[2/14/2021 9:46 PM] tux_linux
oooh


[2/14/2021 9:46 PM] officeraction.
you have to build it first


[2/14/2021 9:47 PM] tux_linux
ok so I'll have to do the section `Using the musl-gcc wrapper` and use the `make` command you provided instead?


[2/14/2021 9:49 PM] officeraction.
read through the thing but basically yea


[2/14/2021 9:49 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/14/2021 9:50 PM] tux_linux
once I'll get Debian installed I'll get back to you on that


[2/14/2021 11:08 PM] officeraction.
it seems musl on the other hand is tuned for static builds. it might be possible to run some musl apps even without the alpine chroot if they are statically built 🧐


[2/14/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
yep but as far as I could read, Palemoon doesn't offer any static build option without some... annoying headaches


[2/14/2021 11:10 PM] officeraction.
if you can link in libmusl statically its already enough


[2/14/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
you mean statically building musl?


[2/14/2021 11:13 PM] officeraction.
i mean statically link to the app.


[2/14/2021 11:13 PM] officeraction.
so its bundeled together


[2/14/2021 11:14 PM] tux_linux
and how would you do that? sorry, I don't have much experience in compiling things (I mean, I *can*, but there are some things I don't understand very well sometimes)


[2/14/2021 11:17 PM] officeraction.
probably just add -static to the cflags


[2/14/2021 11:17 PM] officeraction.
have to try


[2/14/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
when compiling palemoon?


[2/14/2021 11:17 PM] officeraction.
any app


[2/14/2021 11:18 PM] tux_linux
yep that I know
but if I remember correctly Palemoon doesn't want/can't be compiled statically as simple as that


[2/14/2021 11:19 PM] officeraction.
maybe they just mean completly static, because it has lots of other dependencies. but as i said if musl is linked statically its already a win


[2/14/2021 11:20 PM] officeraction.
and it should be possible. the apps from the package manager are also statically linked with musl.


[2/14/2021 11:20 PM] officeraction.
maybe they even run on a non chroot system...


[2/14/2021 11:20 PM] tux_linux
well, I'll try, but I can't promise of anything...
If I packed the QEMU image like the one for the emulator and it had all the dependencies already installed, would you be willing to try to compile it?


[2/14/2021 11:21 PM] tux_linux
IIRC Busybox ran even outside the chroot, so maybe yes, but some other programs didn't (they were linked to dynamic libraries)


[2/14/2021 11:22 PM] officeraction.
maybe you just have to fix the library paths so the apps can find the dependencies 😉


[2/14/2021 11:23 PM] tux_linux
in a nutshell, that's what the chroot does (essentially), right?


[2/14/2021 11:23 PM] officeraction.
if you have everything in an qemu imge you can also compile it yourself it shouldnt be hard at that point 😉


[2/14/2021 11:23 PM] tux_linux
...will try...
with Debian, right?


[2/14/2021 11:23 PM] officeraction.
as you want


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
it's still installing


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] officeraction.
actually i am also installing the toolchain right now


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
nice


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] officeraction.
ah just finished


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] officeraction.
just took about an hour


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
but the toolchain would be for cross-compiling?


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
(i guess)


[2/14/2021 11:24 PM] officeraction.
yep


[2/14/2021 11:25 PM] tux_linux
ok that's nice
Was it like an unattended setup where it downloaded all the sources, built the three-stage GCC + binutils and the like?


[2/14/2021 11:26 PM] officeraction.
yea its all nicely scripted up


[2/14/2021 11:26 PM] tux_linux
what's the name of the toolchain?


[2/14/2021 11:26 PM] officeraction.
um gcc for arm-linux-musleabihf


[2/14/2021 11:26 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/14/2021 11:27 PM] officeraction.
its basicall just a regular gcc just built to compile for arm


[2/14/2021 11:27 PM] tux_linux
Yep
I did try that with koxtoolchain; worked pretty well


[2/14/2021 11:27 PM] tux_linux
I compiled https://github.com/llandsmeer/inkvt with it

[2/14/2021 11:28 PM] officeraction.
yea that also works


[2/14/2021 11:28 PM] officeraction.
thats the other way


[2/14/2021 11:28 PM] tux_linux
other way?


[2/14/2021 11:29 PM] officeraction.
before i said there are 2 ways


[2/14/2021 11:30 PM] tux_linux
oh ok so you meant that there was the cross-compiling and native compiling way (VM)


[2/14/2021 11:32 PM] officeraction.
nono the koxtoolchain and the musl toolchain are both for crosscompiling and both can be made to work (probably) but lets try the musl one


[2/14/2021 11:32 PM] tux_linux
oooooooh
ok then


[2/14/2021 11:35 PM] tux_linux
btw, I'm trying to access an Alpine Linux rootfs via chroot on my x86_64 PC. I'm doing this:
`sudo chroot . /usr/bin/qemu-arm /bin/bash`
but it spits out that:
`chroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/qemu-arm’: No such file or directory`
and if I run this, you can see that it's clearly there:
```[nicolas@archiso kindle]$ ls usr/bin | grep qemu
qemu-arm```
any clue?


[2/14/2021 11:37 PM] officeraction.
what that does is it tries to start qemu iside the chroot. it wont work that way


[2/14/2021 11:38 PM] officeraction.
maybe try qemu-arm ./bin/bash


[2/14/2021 11:38 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/14/2021 11:39 PM] tux_linux
I copied the dynamically linked binary instead of the static one


[2/14/2021 11:39 PM] tux_linux
now it works


[2/14/2021 11:39 PM] officeraction.
ok


[2/14/2021 11:39 PM] tux_linux
`[nicolas@archiso kindle]$ sudo chroot . /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /bin/bash

[2/14/2021 11:39 PM] tux_linux
thanks anyway


[2/15/2021 12:40 AM] tux_linux
I think I'll end up compiling on an Alpine chroot inside Debian, because running it on plain QEMU is not trivial especially for the armv7 one

seems like i just had to force a reboot and it worked fine


[2/15/2021 1:34 AM] the.mightydill
yay


[2/15/2021 1:47 AM] tux_linux
a new role?


[2/15/2021 1:48 AM] tux_linux
suggestion: with ubuntu, dd the sd card image and then you'll be able to flash it on 16GB sd cards without the hassle of resizing the onboard partition every time


[2/15/2021 2:00 AM] the.mightydill
yeah thats a big hassle


[2/15/2021 2:00 AM] the.mightydill
but finally finished


[2/15/2021 2:00 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, create 2 new roles: developer and tester


[2/15/2021 2:00 AM] tux_linux
`dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=sd.img`


[2/15/2021 2:01 AM] tux_linux
but roles ? where ?


[2/15/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
oh ok I think I got it


[2/15/2021 4:26 AM] ferminolaiz
@tux-linux have you thought about trying to compile stuff on the new server?


[2/15/2021 4:26 AM] ferminolaiz
It should be a decent processor, but with the virtualization overhead idk if it would be worth trying


[2/15/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
ooooooooh


[2/15/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
that'd be awesome


[2/15/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
I'll try it tomorrow!


[2/15/2021 4:40 AM] ferminolaiz
The overhead might be a pain, but it'd be interesting to try it out


[2/15/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
yep

Successfully (at last) compiled a new kernel for my Kobo Mini! Actually, I always did not do `make oldconfig` when compiling it... what an idiot was I... (because there was already a config file there, so I didn't think that it should've been reconfigured)
Now I'm building one with `kexec` support and that will (hopefully) print the bootlog to the framebuffer! Isn't that great 😄

[2/17/2021 3:26 AM] the.mightydill
you did?


[2/17/2021 3:26 AM] tux_linux
yep, only the stock config


[2/17/2021 3:26 AM] tux_linux
`make oldconfig`


[2/17/2021 3:27 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[2/17/2021 3:27 AM] the.mightydill
so if i test out your kernel (great work btw), i'd have to flash an img, right?


[2/17/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
no, just the uImage


[2/17/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
`dd if=uImage of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=2048`


[2/17/2021 3:28 AM] tux_linux
it writes it to an MBR sector of the SD
(not in any partition)


[2/17/2021 3:28 AM] the.mightydill
so in the unallocated space?


[2/17/2021 3:28 AM] tux_linux
well, it's actually before the rootfs partition


[2/17/2021 3:29 AM] tux_linux
like
--- some hidden data there (dtb, kernel, u-boot, etc)
+ rootfs
+ recoveryfs
+ onboard


[2/17/2021 3:29 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[2/17/2021 3:29 AM] tux_linux
i can share the uimage now


[2/17/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/uImage-orig-B37A0


[2/17/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
put it in /mnt/onboard


[2/17/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
thanks, post the instructions here; i have to go eat


[2/17/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
sorry


[2/17/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
and then
(telnet/ssh)
`dd if=/mnt/onboard/uImage-orig of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=2048`


[2/17/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
after:
`reboot`


[2/17/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
(pray and hope it doesn't brick the device, but it should be fine)


[2/17/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
@fermino do you have any clue on this? thx


[2/17/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux is this good

[2/17/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
then reboot


[2/17/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
k


[2/17/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
crossing my fingers...


[2/17/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
yep...


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
hm but what F/W are you on?


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
it won't work if it's not the stock one


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
stock firmware


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
yay, it booted and nickel is running


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
well 2.1 or 4.26?


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
4.25


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
hm really?


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
oh that's great then


[2/17/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/17/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
just had to sideload the glo f/w


[2/17/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux
you know a new update came out today?


[2/17/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/17/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
updating it now actually


[2/17/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux
well now you can run `uname -a` to enjoy a 2021 kernel


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
but apart of that, you won't get any reward except that the device's not bricked ;p


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
:D

[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
(at least for now though)


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
so will kobox run?


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
theoritically no


[2/17/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
but


[2/17/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
let me try with a different ... kernel?
nvm it'll never boot


[2/17/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
so this kernel isnt compatible with kobox?


[2/17/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
I mean, if it hasn't booted when I changed a config option, if I change the entire kernel it will be a mess


[2/17/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/17/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
no, sadly
but we *could* succeed and implement some sort of 3.0 kernel that would work if we knew what was going on when booting
*ah I wish I had a serial connection set up*


[2/17/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
I can send you the non-working one, look at the pattern the light flashes
after that, reflash the working one on your PC with Ubuntu (or maybe WSL?) with the same command


[2/17/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
non-working what?


[2/17/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
uimage


[2/17/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
the light flashes differently, you'll see


[2/17/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
i cant use ubuntu for the foreseeable future though, have to stick with wsl for now


[2/17/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
wsl is windows sub-linux, right?


[2/17/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/uImage-B6F8C


[2/17/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
i think
do you have like a /dev/mmcblk0 in WSL?


[2/17/2021 4:00 AM] the.mightydill
no idea


[2/17/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
`ls /dev | grep mmc`


[2/17/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
i need an sqlite reader... to read koboreader.sqlite


[2/17/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
huh you lost me there
what? why would you need to read the sqlite file?


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
i need to edit something


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
`sudo apt install sqlite3`


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
but that's CLI though
I don't know of GUI clients, let me check


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
got one


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/17/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
called sqlite trek


[2/17/2021 4:04 AM] tux_linux
you really should see my Mac's Debian screensavers now
each time it's a different one and it seems the computer has a seizure
like the screen is going crazy and it prints random patterns that don't make any sense


[2/17/2021 4:04 AM] tux_linux
I installed Debian i686 on it to use the 32 bit toolchain by KoboLabs


[2/17/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
heh


[2/17/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
whats the best linux distro in your opinion?


[2/17/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[2/17/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
well Arch is pretty good for most of the use you're going to make out of it


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
but I also like Gentoo and Linux From Scratch


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
i remember seeing something like "damn small linux"


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
Debian-based are pretty good too, but kind of in the heavier side


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
yep, it *existed*


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
hahah


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
last stable is from 2008 ;p


[2/17/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[2/17/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
but there's Slax also

[2/17/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
(in the small ones)


[2/17/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
and other ones could be like SliTaz Linux (50 MB iso), Tiny Core Linux (16MB iso, yep!), Puppy Linux and FatDog64 Linux


[2/17/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux

yep, it *is* actually nice


[2/17/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
like honestly, it's not hard to install it
(well OK, I must have done it more than 15 times but still, it's pretty straightforward compared to GENTOO install process https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation/en)


[2/17/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
unfortunately, im "still too young" to have a laptop


[2/17/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
but what do you have then?


[2/17/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
a pc, another pc, and a laptop


[2/17/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
all of them are family ones


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
that's not cool


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
I understand why you want to use your Kobo as a computer then


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
yep...


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
I totally agree


[2/17/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
been tryna do it since i was 11


[2/17/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, me I got one in August, and I stopped going on Mobileread for some months because I didn't find the addons I wanted, and I didn't have the skills to develop them


[2/17/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
but now... *now* that we figured out how to run Xorg on Kobos
*sky's the limit*


[2/17/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
*yes*


[2/17/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
btw, i found me an android image for the kobo glo


[2/17/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
(well as soon as we fix that darn touch input thing)


[2/17/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
but it's pretty old, is it?


[2/17/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
like 2.3?


[2/17/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
yep

2013


[2/17/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
I used that once on a phone and it was garbage
quick sidenote: the phone too had 256MB of RAM. worst thing is that it was running Android


[2/17/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
*which slowed down things painfully*


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
if it ran Nickel, it would've been fine


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
dang


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
yeah imagine if we got a SIM card tray in a Kobo lol


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
and we created a custom app integrated into nickel to send sms and make phone calls


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
hahaha yes


[2/17/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
and now its time to get off


[2/17/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
that'd be awesome
and we'd have an audio jack too for music

[2/17/2021 1:29 PM] ferminolaiz
Not really, is that within the kernel options or something else?


[2/17/2021 1:32 PM] ferminolaiz
well, if we get USB OTG working then this is a piece of cake


[2/17/2021 1:33 PM] ferminolaiz
Or if we can have any sort of serial comm, making a custom module shouldnt be too hard


[2/17/2021 1:34 PM] ferminolaiz

Serial Output From a Damaged Kobo
My Kobo eBook Reader died, and while dissecting it I found the hidden serial connection. Using RealTerm, I managed to view the operating system's (linux) messages. It didn't respond to anything I tried over serial, but a wake-up response is evident when any of its buttons is pressed.

[2/17/2021 1:39 PM] ferminolaiz
So we might get some hints about the kernel with that


[2/17/2021 1:43 PM] tux_linux
Of course thanks!


[2/17/2021 1:43 PM] tux_linux
I don't have the equipment for that


[2/17/2021 1:43 PM] tux_linux
If it works, can you share how you got it running? Thx


[2/17/2021 1:43 PM] ferminolaiz
Sure


[2/17/2021 1:44 PM] tux_linux
Yep it's in .config (CONFIG_KEXEC)


[2/17/2021 1:49 PM] tux_linux
If you want, I'll compile a kernel with the default configuration for the Clara and you'll be able to test it with serial, and if it works we'll add features to the kernel!


[2/17/2021 1:49 PM] ferminolaiz
Sure, that'd be great


[2/17/2021 1:49 PM] tux_linux

I won't be home for another week, though


[2/17/2021 1:50 PM] ferminolaiz

@tux-linux where is the apk binary supposed to be?


[2/17/2021 2:09 PM] ferminolaiz
@tux-linux should the chroot set a new `$PATH` automatically?

There's all sort of stuff for serial comms in the kobos


[2/17/2021 2:26 PM] tux_linux
Did you mount /dev/pts?


[2/17/2021 2:26 PM] tux_linux
`mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts`


[2/17/2021 2:26 PM] ferminolaiz
Oh, that might be why


[2/17/2021 2:26 PM] tux_linux
Add that in the rcS


[2/17/2021 2:26 PM] tux_linux
(take out the SD and edit the file)


[2/17/2021 2:27 PM] ferminolaiz
It's updating now, anyways


[2/17/2021 2:27 PM] tux_linux
For emergency things you might also want to enable telnet
`busybox telnetd -F`
No.. it's already enabled. Sorry
Also don't forget to mkdir /dev/pts after dev is mounted

[2/17/2021 2:37 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap

```


[2/17/2021 2:45 PM] ferminolaiz
At least the kernel info output


[2/17/2021 2:46 PM] tux_linux
I wonder if it's editable


[2/17/2021 2:46 PM] tux_linux
Eg if you change `mem` to 256 and reboot


[2/17/2021 3:02 PM] ferminolaiz

@tux-linux if it's okay with you I'll add `git` and `nano` to the base layout


[2/17/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
Yep


[2/17/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
Add vim too


[2/17/2021 3:40 PM] ferminolaiz
Sure


[2/17/2021 3:41 PM] ferminolaiz
The coolest thing is that we can do a `git checkout` and get the whole system back to a known good state


[2/17/2021 3:54 PM] ferminolaiz
GREAT

Install openssh-client


[2/17/2021 5:01 PM] ferminolaiz
yeah, it's done


[2/17/2021 5:01 PM] tux_linux
Or clone via https


[2/17/2021 5:02 PM] ferminolaiz
Can I push through https?


[2/17/2021 5:02 PM] tux_linux
Yep


[2/17/2021 5:02 PM] tux_linux
It's actually simpler than ssh

[2/17/2021 5:02 PM] ferminolaiz
we had that same problem at work the other day


[2/17/2021 5:03 PM] ferminolaiz
fixed


[2/17/2021 5:10 PM] tux_linux
Oooooh
That's not good


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Are you on v3.13?


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] ferminolaiz
Nop


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
But how did you fix it?


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] ferminolaiz
It was only when I went against the ddns domain


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] ferminolaiz
But with the proxy works fine


[2/17/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[2/17/2021 5:12 PM] ferminolaiz
Anyways I'm trying to use ssh bc I don't want to hardcode the password


[2/17/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Oh yeah


[2/17/2021 5:13 PM] ferminolaiz
oks, now it works


[2/17/2021 5:14 PM] ferminolaiz
I needed to mount /dev/pts I think


[2/17/2021 5:15 PM] ferminolaiz
Theere we go

I'll write up a 'Guidelines' file for those who want to develop with the provided rootfs


[2/17/2021 10:09 PM] ferminolaiz
Does gitea have a repo wiki feature?


[2/17/2021 10:09 PM] ferminolaiz
Btw I added some issues if you want to take a look at them


[2/17/2021 10:36 PM] tux_linux
Nice, I'll take a look! Should be back home an hour from now


[2/17/2021 10:36 PM] tux_linux
I'll see for the wiki


[2/17/2021 10:41 PM] tux_linux
There seems to be a wiki tab


[2/17/2021 11:38 PM] tux_linux
Ok I'm back at home. I'll start testing things on my Glo HD


[2/18/2021 1:59 AM] tux_linux
news for the mini and kernel
seems that compiling Marek Gibek's kernel optimized for Xorg works and boots fine https://github.com/marek-g/kobo-kernel-2.6.35.3-marek/blob/linux/build_instructions
but as soon as I enable CONFIG_KEXEC, it
1) green light on
2) blue light on for ~10 secs
3) blue light shuts down
and then it's powered off
@fermino, I think I'll buy a serial port kit too

[2/18/2021 2:00 AM] ferminolaiz
@tux-linux just make sure the signals are 3.3V or it might damage the port in the processor


[2/18/2021 2:00 AM] ferminolaiz
If you want I can take a look at it before you buy it


[2/18/2021 2:00 AM] tux_linux
ok
I might try it on my Glo HD, since it's already half-destroyed, so it won't bother me if it breaks ;p


[2/18/2021 2:00 AM] tux_linux
of course, please, if you want!


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] ferminolaiz
Or well, if you have a rpi you can direct connect it with some wires


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] tux_linux
yes I know
but would it be easier with just the converter kit?


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] ferminolaiz
Honestly it would be easier with the rpi


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] ferminolaiz
I mean, it's literally just the same


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] tux_linux
we don't have soldering equipment for that at home, so I'll have to ask my father which is engineer to do it at his job


[2/18/2021 2:01 AM] ferminolaiz
And with the rpi you're sure the signals are 3.3V


[2/18/2021 2:02 AM] tux_linux
is it the same voltage for all Kobo models?


[2/18/2021 2:02 AM] ferminolaiz
It should, technically


[2/18/2021 2:02 AM] ferminolaiz
I don't really know, though


[2/18/2021 2:02 AM] ferminolaiz
Technically = I'm totally guessing hahaha


[2/18/2021 2:03 AM] ferminolaiz
In any case, if you only use the tx line (in the kobo) you should be safe as it only transmits and the rpi receives


[2/18/2021 2:03 AM] tux_linux
ok
I looked into some docs for serial on RPis, but would it be possible to do it without soldering?


[2/18/2021 2:03 AM] ferminolaiz
Hm...


[2/18/2021 2:03 AM] tux_linux
oh and I looked at my Glo HD's PCB
it has 3 serial connections


[2/18/2021 2:03 AM] ferminolaiz
Can you take a pic?


[2/18/2021 2:04 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/18/2021 2:04 AM] tux_linux
it's uploading


[2/18/2021 2:04 AM] ferminolaiz
I can take a look at the NXP datasheets to see the signal voltage


[2/18/2021 2:04 AM] tux_linux
thx


[2/18/2021 2:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Maybe tomorrow, but for debugging the kernel output you should be safe

[2/18/2021 2:05 AM] ferminolaiz
If you want to transmit to the kobo then I'd double check to make sure (or if you have an oscilloscope (or an arduino) take a look at the tx output voltage


[2/18/2021 2:05 AM] tux_linux
don't have either of them


[2/18/2021 2:05 AM] tux_linux
:/


[2/18/2021 2:06 AM] ferminolaiz
Woah, 3


[2/18/2021 2:06 AM] ferminolaiz
If all of them works that's waay useful


[2/18/2021 2:06 AM] tux_linux
but for the wires, it'd be like one in the rx hole and one in the rpi?


[2/18/2021 2:06 AM] ferminolaiz
You need to connect ground


[2/18/2021 2:06 AM] ferminolaiz
Gnd


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] ferminolaiz
And then yes, for now it would be TXD (Kobo) to RXD (rpi)


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] tux_linux
you should check your clara's PCB too; I missed those two while looking at the board
and then I discovered them an hour ago


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] tux_linux
ok... like I could "roll" the cables on the RPi's GPIO?


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] ferminolaiz
And GND to GND


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Roll?


[2/18/2021 2:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Didn't get you there haha


[2/18/2021 2:08 AM] tux_linux
well, how would I connect them?


[2/18/2021 2:08 AM] tux_linux
(keeping contact)


[2/18/2021 2:08 AM] ferminolaiz
On the rpi side it has some dupont connectors


[2/18/2021 2:09 AM] ferminolaiz
And on the kobo, you could try to hold it by hand but it will be hard and will kindof complicate it


[2/18/2021 2:09 AM] ferminolaiz
Specially because you're gonna be trying to debug the kernel


[2/18/2021 2:10 AM] tux_linux
I could "glue" it maybe? tape?


[2/18/2021 2:10 AM] ferminolaiz
And the better the connection the less amounts of points of failure we would have


[2/18/2021 2:10 AM] tux_linux

If you somehow manage to have it in contact, I don't see why not


[2/18/2021 2:10 AM] tux_linux
that's my RPi GPIO


[2/18/2021 2:10 AM] ferminolaiz
Your dad might not like it though (?


[2/18/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
yep, but he knows what I'm talking about when I tell him about serial things and all


[2/18/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
actually he might know more than myself on that thing


[2/18/2021 2:11 AM] ferminolaiz
For sure, I would ask him for some help


[2/18/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
certainly


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] ferminolaiz
Trying to debug stuff like that is not easy


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] ferminolaiz
You never know if it's your fault or other thing hahaha


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] tux_linux
but I didn't get you on the 'dupont connector' thing
my RPi doesn't seem to have one...


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll send a pic


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] tux_linux
well I searched on google


[2/18/2021 2:12 AM] tux_linux
but I don't have that right now


[2/18/2021 2:14 AM] tux_linux
btw if you didn't already buy the serial converter, you might like to buy the RPi Zero instead
will serve you more in the future I guess ^^

yeaaaaaaaah might have that somewhere


[2/18/2021 2:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Those are the dupont connectors


[2/18/2021 2:14 AM] ferminolaiz
And the rpi has a 2xtwenty-something male header


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] ferminolaiz
I have a rpi at home, but it's a rpi B I think


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] ferminolaiz
Ooold


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] tux_linux
so theoritically you wouldn't need to buy a converter


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] ferminolaiz
And a couple of converters too hahah


[2/18/2021 2:15 AM] tux_linux
oh you already have one


[2/18/2021 2:16 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/18/2021 2:16 AM] ferminolaiz
I've been working on electronics for quite a while


[2/18/2021 2:16 AM] ferminolaiz
Never done any professional project, though


[2/18/2021 2:16 AM] ferminolaiz
But if I could work with electronics I'd do it


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] tux_linux
not to be intrusive or anything, but in what domain are you working on?


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] tux_linux
i'm just curious


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Programming!


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] tux_linux
that's nice


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Your good, mate!


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Php, mostly


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
And nodejs


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] tux_linux
great
I know a bit of NodeJS
no php though


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
You're not missing anything out! Hahahah


[2/18/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Pho is good, but everyone hates it


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] ferminolaiz
What I truly love is C (even though I don't know a lot)


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] tux_linux
but do *you* hate it?


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] tux_linux
yep me too


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] ferminolaiz
Nah, I don't, it has its place and purpose and it's good at it


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] tux_linux
It's miles better than Python


[2/18/2021 2:18 AM] ferminolaiz
And I honestly quite like it


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] tux_linux
but you surely know more than me in C


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] ferminolaiz
Idk


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] ferminolaiz
I've done some things with electronics


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] ferminolaiz
But almost nothing on pc


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] ferminolaiz
So it's mostly a weird mix between low level C++ and mid level C


[2/18/2021 2:19 AM] tux_linux
well you'll learn with Kobos


[2/18/2021 2:20 AM] ferminolaiz
(C++ with classes and without stdlib)


[2/18/2021 2:20 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/18/2021 2:20 AM] ferminolaiz
So it's mostly C with classes hahaha


[2/18/2021 2:20 AM] tux_linux
you lost me there ;p


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] ferminolaiz
On microcontrollers you don't have lots of ram so you usually try to stay on statically reserved memory as long as you can


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
yep, microcontrollers are very interesting, might buy one soon


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] ferminolaiz
You're good! You know what POO is?


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] ferminolaiz
OOP* in english


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
hmm no
let me look it up on google


[2/18/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
oh yea


[2/18/2021 2:22 AM] ferminolaiz
There is something really cool called MixroPython, you might like it


[2/18/2021 2:22 AM] tux_linux
yep I've definitely done some extensive use of it with Python


[2/18/2021 2:22 AM] tux_linux
yeah, I know


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, C++ supports OOP, but C doesn't


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] tux_linux
so it's like a mix of C/C++


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] ferminolaiz
So I've mostly used C++, but without stdlib


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] ferminolaiz
And most of the things end up being *mostly* plain C


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] tux_linux
Well here in French it's called "Programmation orientée objet"


[2/18/2021 2:23 AM] ferminolaiz
Nice


[2/18/2021 2:24 AM] ferminolaiz
French is on my list of languages to learn, after Italian


[2/18/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
well you speak Spanish, right?


[2/18/2021 2:24 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/18/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
it shouldn't be too difficult


[2/18/2021 2:25 AM] ferminolaiz
I also know some Haitian Kreyole


[2/18/2021 2:25 AM] ferminolaiz
So I (not really but we'll xD) can catch up some french in movies and so


[2/18/2021 2:25 AM] ferminolaiz
Well*


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] tux_linux
but to come back to the rpi, what should I do with the dupont connector? find one and connect one wire to the kobo, and the end of the cable to the GPIO?


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] tux_linux
nice


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] ferminolaiz
You'd need two cables


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] tux_linux
for tx/rx?


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] tux_linux
or tx/gnd


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] ferminolaiz
You should solder it, if possible


[2/18/2021 2:26 AM] ferminolaiz
Tx/gnd for now


[2/18/2021 2:27 AM] ferminolaiz
And after you have it soldered you connect the dupont end


[2/18/2021 2:27 AM] ferminolaiz
To the rpi


[2/18/2021 2:27 AM] ferminolaiz
GND to GND


[2/18/2021 2:27 AM] ferminolaiz
And tx (kobo) to rx (rpi)


[2/18/2021 2:28 AM] tux_linux
ok...
so
1. find a dupont connector
2. connect the dupont end (GND) to the rpi and gnd to the kobo
3. somehow connect the wire on the Kobo on TX and keep it there and connect the dupont end (RX) to the rpi


[2/18/2021 2:28 AM] tux_linux
right?


[2/18/2021 2:29 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah


[2/18/2021 2:29 AM] ferminolaiz
If you're not soldering you probably want to connect it to the rpi first


[2/18/2021 2:29 AM] tux_linux
guess the hardest step is going to be step 1


[2/18/2021 2:29 AM] ferminolaiz
Probably


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] ferminolaiz
Well


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] tux_linux
where could I find one?


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] ferminolaiz
If you have old hardware around


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] tux_linux
yep, lots of old hardware here


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] ferminolaiz
You can find one inside an old computer


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] ferminolaiz
The cables that go to the led/switches are the same ones


[2/18/2021 2:30 AM] tux_linux
ok there's an old 286 pc there
... maybe...?


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] ferminolaiz
*likely*


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] tux_linux
like oooooh the ones that you connect to hard drives, for ... power?
hmm no, right?


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] ferminolaiz
Nope


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] ferminolaiz
Smaller


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] ferminolaiz
The ones that go to the front of the cade


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] tux_linux
?fans?


[2/18/2021 2:31 AM] ferminolaiz
Case*


[2/18/2021 2:32 AM] ferminolaiz
Fans coouuld work


[2/18/2021 2:32 AM] tux_linux
ok I'll go and look now


[2/18/2021 2:32 AM] ferminolaiz
But might not, it really depends on the connector


[2/18/2021 2:32 AM] ferminolaiz
But if it has a case and you can destroy one of the front LEDs or switches, you have one for granted


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] tux_linux
that's interesting


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] tux_linux
even like a case from 1992?


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] ferminolaiz
Even more likely


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] tux_linux
ok I'll go and check


[2/18/2021 2:33 AM] ferminolaiz
It's probably connected to the bottom right of the motherboard


[2/18/2021 2:34 AM] tux_linux
wait I'll show you a pic

that?


[2/18/2021 2:37 AM] ferminolaiz
You sure you can destroy it? (Well or at least take a cable?)


[2/18/2021 2:37 AM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/18/2021 2:37 AM] ferminolaiz
Exactly that


[2/18/2021 2:37 AM] tux_linux
I'll see where it goes


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] tux_linux
but it's semi-working, sometimes the keyboard isn't detected


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] ferminolaiz
The ram is on the top, right?


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] tux_linux
yep, those fat sticks you see


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] ferminolaiz
Then I'd take the cable of one LED


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] ferminolaiz
Cables*


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] ferminolaiz
The pair


[2/18/2021 2:38 AM] ferminolaiz
So you still have working switched


[2/18/2021 2:39 AM] tux_linux
yeah of course, maybe the one of the "turbo" button ^^

[2/18/2021 2:39 AM] ferminolaiz
Woah


[2/18/2021 2:39 AM] ferminolaiz
And where is the processor?


[2/18/2021 2:39 AM] tux_linux
hmm let me show you...


[2/18/2021 2:40 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh, btw, the GND cable you can connect it to a screw in the kobo pcb


[2/18/2021 2:40 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/18/2021 2:40 AM] ferminolaiz
And I'm thinking


[2/18/2021 2:41 AM] ferminolaiz
You know those things you use to clean in between your teeth?


[2/18/2021 2:41 AM] ferminolaiz
Idk the name


[2/18/2021 2:41 AM] ferminolaiz
Those tiny wooden sticks?


[2/18/2021 2:41 AM] tux_linux
hmm don't know either

we'll call it "things"


[2/18/2021 2:41 AM] tux_linux
not the main one, but worth showing


[2/18/2021 2:42 AM] ferminolaiz
Toothpick


[2/18/2021 2:42 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/18/2021 2:42 AM] ferminolaiz
You might get away with one of those and the tx pin


[2/18/2021 2:42 AM] ferminolaiz

yep maybe
that seems to be the main one


[2/18/2021 2:43 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh that *actually* is a 286


[2/18/2021 2:43 AM] ferminolaiz
That's awesome


[2/18/2021 2:43 AM] tux_linux
is it?


[2/18/2021 2:43 AM] ferminolaiz
I think so


[2/18/2021 2:43 AM] tux_linux
it runs windows 3.1 fine


[2/18/2021 2:44 AM] ferminolaiz
Newer models didn't have the math coprocessor


[2/18/2021 2:44 AM] tux_linux
but well if you say that it's so valuable
I might try another "brontosaure" as we say it in french
in my house


[2/18/2021 2:44 AM] tux_linux
it's a PC with one of the first AMDs


[2/18/2021 2:45 AM] ferminolaiz
I mean, the connector is not a big deal


[2/18/2021 2:45 AM] ferminolaiz
The motherboard is what's worth it ^^


[2/18/2021 2:45 AM] tux_linux
Well I know it's just nice to see the orange Turbo light


[2/18/2021 2:45 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahahah


[2/18/2021 2:46 AM] tux_linux
But how would you value the board? Not that I want to sell it, but I didn't think it was worth anything


[2/18/2021 2:46 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, it's one of those things I've never seen in front of me


[2/18/2021 2:46 AM] ferminolaiz
And I've had lots of old motherboards


[2/18/2021 2:46 AM] ferminolaiz
But never a working one


[2/18/2021 2:46 AM] ferminolaiz
And I'm kindof in love with old tech


[2/18/2021 2:47 AM] ferminolaiz

Nice me too


[2/18/2021 2:47 AM] ferminolaiz
It's probably more a "how cool!!" Value than monetary value


[2/18/2021 2:47 AM] tux_linux
Oh ok that's still nice


[2/18/2021 2:48 AM] tux_linux
If you look at the picture, the fan is not lying
It's really like if a volcano was exploding when the PC is turned on


[2/18/2021 2:49 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahah


[2/18/2021 2:50 AM] tux_linux
No, seriously
It's even worse than my internet switch


[2/18/2021 2:50 AM] ferminolaiz
I'm putting my bets (? On the white-green cable


[2/18/2021 2:50 AM] ferminolaiz
I can believe it hahahah


[2/18/2021 2:50 AM] tux_linux
Yep seems good


[2/18/2021 2:50 AM] ferminolaiz
I'm pretty sure it's the power LED

Would it not be "power switch"?


[2/18/2021 2:52 AM] tux_linux
Ha found you power led


[2/18/2021 2:53 AM] tux_linux
But there are three holes on the connector though


[2/18/2021 2:53 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap, that's the switch


[2/18/2021 2:53 AM] ferminolaiz
Hm


[2/18/2021 2:53 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, before anything let's find the rpi header info

This


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] ferminolaiz
The 3 connector one


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] tux_linux
What a coincidence


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] tux_linux
I'm not sure it's the right size though


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] ferminolaiz
If not it could be to the left


[2/18/2021 2:56 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, it probably is


[2/18/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux
Wait I'll grab my rpi


[2/18/2021 2:57 AM] ferminolaiz
You can try it out before connecting anything though


[2/18/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux
Yep it's not even powered on


[2/18/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux
It's a perfect fit :)


[2/18/2021 2:58 AM] ferminolaiz
Nice


[2/18/2021 2:58 AM] ferminolaiz
I have to go soon, though


[2/18/2021 2:58 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 2:58 AM] ferminolaiz
But tbh I think it's gonna work great with a toothpick


[2/18/2021 2:58 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahah


[2/18/2021 2:59 AM] tux_linux
Well I'll try on my own then


[2/18/2021 2:59 AM] tux_linux
With my dad


[2/18/2021 2:59 AM] tux_linux
Or are you going to be back soon?


[2/18/2021 2:59 AM] ferminolaiz
Oks


[2/18/2021 2:59 AM] ferminolaiz
Couple tips


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
Ground can go to a "ground plane" on the pcb, you can attach it to one of the screws that will have the copper layer (orange-ish) exposed


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] tux_linux
Ok


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
Then you put the screw and make sure the copper of the cable doesn't touch anything else


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
- you're gonna have to figure out the toothpick thing xD


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] tux_linux
But there is already a gnd pin on the PCB, right?


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
But for you to not have to hold it all the time


[2/18/2021 3:00 AM] ferminolaiz
You can screw it in


[2/18/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
Ok
Will you come back soon? I can wait


[2/18/2021 3:01 AM] ferminolaiz
(I'm going to go to sleep hahahah)


[2/18/2021 3:01 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 3:02 AM] tux_linux
Ok then, so I'll (try) to do it myself


[2/18/2021 3:02 AM] ferminolaiz
And the other thing is: out of the 3 ports my guess is that it's J1


[2/18/2021 3:02 AM] tux_linux
Ok


[2/18/2021 3:02 AM] ferminolaiz
(J1 is the label right next to it)


[2/18/2021 3:02 AM] ferminolaiz
I'm guessing because it's the first one and the one that is alone


[2/18/2021 3:03 AM] tux_linux
So the one bottom right?


[2/18/2021 3:03 AM] ferminolaiz
(for the rpi, the baudrate should be 115200, the other options as default, you could try using `minicom` or something like that)


[2/18/2021 3:03 AM] tux_linux
Yep


[2/18/2021 3:04 AM] tux_linux
Could I brick my rpi if I don't set the correct baudrate?
Like could it be dead?


[2/18/2021 3:04 AM] ferminolaiz
No


[2/18/2021 3:04 AM] ferminolaiz
Well


[2/18/2021 3:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/18/2021 3:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Not really


[2/18/2021 3:05 AM] ferminolaiz
If you're careful


[2/18/2021 3:06 AM] ferminolaiz
The worst case is if you flip the GND and tx signals


[2/18/2021 3:06 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 3:06 AM] tux_linux
Ok I hope I won't do that


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] ferminolaiz
It could (just could) fry the serial port in the rpi


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Just make sure to keep the black cable to the outside


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] ferminolaiz
The pin header is probably labeled


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] tux_linux
Only the serial port


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] tux_linux
At least


[2/18/2021 3:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] ferminolaiz
(and well, then GND = black)


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] ferminolaiz
And in the kobo GND is that 2-3 dashes symbol


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] tux_linux
Yep


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] tux_linux
Oh actually


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] ferminolaiz
`PIN1`


[2/18/2021 3:08 AM] tux_linux
The cable only has two threads
Not three


[2/18/2021 3:09 AM] ferminolaiz
And just refer to this


[2/18/2021 3:09 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/18/2021 3:09 AM] ferminolaiz
If you see we're not connecting the tx in the raspi


[2/18/2021 3:09 AM] ferminolaiz
Just the ground + rxd


[2/18/2021 3:09 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[2/18/2021 3:10 AM] tux_linux
That's luck


[2/18/2021 3:10 AM] tux_linux
I already cut it ;p


[2/18/2021 3:11 AM] tux_linux
So I have to "cut" the cable so the wire is exposed?

ok! my dad is ok to help me so guess I'll do it now! but thanks very very much!!!!


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] ferminolaiz
Oks mate!


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] ferminolaiz
Good luck then!


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] tux_linux
actually I'm so excited to see serial output coming out of ... an eReader


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahah


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] ferminolaiz
If it works I can maybe design some modules for it


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] tux_linux
nice


[2/18/2021 3:21 AM] ferminolaiz
Like to interface with the outside world


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
yeah like bluetooth


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] ferminolaiz
Audio would be probably overkill


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] ferminolaiz
But it's worth trying


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
wait wait


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
all is worth trying
and if this thing is able to play youtube


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
then audio shouldn't be a problem


[2/18/2021 3:22 AM] ferminolaiz
let me do some math


[2/18/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
at least we could listen to some podcasts in low quality, right?


[2/18/2021 3:23 AM] ferminolaiz
We could get some audio out of it


[2/18/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
some beeps


[2/18/2021 3:23 AM] ferminolaiz
Not hi-fi, not at all


[2/18/2021 3:24 AM] ferminolaiz

[2/18/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
My PC just got killed because I'd eaten up all the RAM


[2/18/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
So that means recompiling 2 days of Palemoon :/


[2/18/2021 3:34 AM] the.mightydill
that's sad


[2/18/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
Yeah...


[2/18/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
But I'm trying something exciting tonight though


[2/18/2021 3:36 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
I hope I get this serial thing working


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
oooh


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
a serial connection


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
To debug this $#@$#@ kernel


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
And to have some fun


[2/18/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
gotta have some fun


[2/18/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
I'll keep you posted


[2/18/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
it works! thanks @fermino!

"Unhandled fault: Alignment Exception" Error booting Freescale 2.6....
Hello All,   I've downloaded and compiled Freescale's 2.6.35 kernel from their opensource gitweb, but when I boot the kernel on my i.MX53QSB I get a series of 8 Unhandled fault: alignment exception errors.  I've attached my complete boot output, but the first occurrence of the boot error is shown be...


[2/18/2021 11:57 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeeeey


[2/18/2021 11:57 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, now the rabbit hole of debugging the kernel hahahah


[2/18/2021 12:08 PM] ferminolaiz
`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- EXTRA_CFLAGS=-mno-unaligned-access`


[2/18/2021 12:10 PM] ferminolaiz
And that post you sent points here, took a quick look and might be worth reading https://web.archive.org/web/20150324062536/http://blog.galemin.com/tag/codesourcery/


[2/18/2021 12:12 PM] ferminolaiz
```So at the moment we have default software handling for unaligned memory access faults in kernel and new CodeSourcery 2011.03-41 cross-compiler with “Unaligned access support” feature enabled by default. **As I understand, It means that compiler tries to optimize unaligned memory access with assumption that “A bit” in Control Register is unset (reset value) and hardware should handle all unaligned memory loads. But this bit is set by Linux kernel, thus, after memory access optimisation by cross-compiler ARM processor generates alignment faults, which are handled by software traps in kernel.**

There are two solutions for this issue. The first one is described in my previous post (“**-mno-unaligned-access**” parameter). **And the second is to disable alignment faults checking in Linux kernel (clear “A bit” in Control Register). I think the second solution is more preferable as hardware unaligned loads support is much faster than software handling.** After some investigation I found that alignment traps generation can be controlled using “ALIGNMENT_TRAP” kernel config parameter in “arch/arm/Kconfig”, but this parameter is by default true and it can’t be configured in menuconfig. In order to be able to change it’s value just add “Software alignment trap” text after “bool”:

config ALIGNMENT_TRAP
bool “Software alignment trap”

And unset it in menuconfig:

Kernel Features —>
    [ ] Software alignment trap```


[2/18/2021 12:22 PM] ferminolaiz
@tux-linux if this works this could be a huge leap forward!


[2/18/2021 1:36 PM] tux_linux
Yep I'll try that ASAP thanks again!!!!


[2/18/2021 1:36 PM] ferminolaiz
😄


[2/18/2021 1:37 PM] tux_linux
Oh also
Would it be possible to (easily) add add TX line on the rpi?


[2/18/2021 1:38 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/18/2021 1:38 PM] ferminolaiz
Let me look something up and I'll confirm it


[2/18/2021 1:38 PM] tux_linux
Ok!


[2/18/2021 2:41 PM] tux_linux
also, I just realized that I could flash and try new kernels on eMMC devices, and even if they don't work I can re-flash them with U-Boot on serial


[2/18/2021 2:41 PM] tux_linux
e.g. this will be useful for the Aura


[2/18/2021 2:53 PM] tux_linux
@fermino the cflags option didn't work. now it stops at "Starting kernel..."
Will try with the link you provided

[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] ferminolaiz
How much time did you leave it trying to boot?


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] tux_linux
well until the light turned off


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] tux_linux
after that I could power it on again


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] ferminolaiz
Ideas: 
- Disable ALL optimizations in GCC


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] tux_linux
so it likely auto shutdown


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] ferminolaiz
- Roll back to an older GCC version


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] tux_linux
well GCC 4.8 is not old enough?


[2/18/2021 3:00 PM] ferminolaiz
oh boy


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] ferminolaiz
nvm then


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] tux_linux
I'm using a 2013 toolchain haha


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahah


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] tux_linux
But I'm compiling now with the blog post you shared


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] tux_linux
It's strange that the default config worked though


[2/18/2021 3:01 PM] ferminolaiz
Maybe try with gcc-4.7.3


[2/18/2021 3:02 PM] tux_linux
And also, hooking up the Mini to serial is like 100 times more difficult than the Glo HD


[2/18/2021 3:02 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/18/2021 3:02 PM] ferminolaiz
```Addendum: some kernels (at least 2.6.35.3 and 2.6.38 from the Freescale Quick Start Board BSP) override EXTRA_CFLAGS in the Makefiles, so needs an extra patch to make the kernel bootable when using a newer toolchain with EXTRA_CFLAGS=-mno-unaligned-access.

The main culprit seems to be in arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile:

-EXTRA_CFLAGS := -fpic -fno-builtin
-EXTRA_ASFLAGS := -Wa,-march=all
+ccflags-y := -fpic -fno-builtin
+asflags-y := -Wa,-march=all``` Have you seen this one?


[2/18/2021 3:02 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/18/2021 3:02 PM] tux_linux
will try after if it doesn't work

that's the mini


[2/18/2021 3:03 PM] ferminolaiz
which cflag did you use?


[2/18/2021 3:03 PM] tux_linux
I'll check


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] tux_linux
now it's compiling


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] ferminolaiz
hahah I have to post that pic on twitter


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] ferminolaiz
may I use it?


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] tux_linux
yep, just mention me @tuxgnulinux


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] ferminolaiz
sure


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] tux_linux
you know the game Mikado?


[2/18/2021 3:04 PM] ferminolaiz
nop, whats that?


[2/18/2021 3:05 PM] tux_linux
it's like if you were playing it while you attach the Mini to serial


[2/18/2021 3:05 PM] tux_linux
It's a game like if anything breaks, all breaks


[2/18/2021 3:05 PM] tux_linux
all those tiny wood sticks


[2/18/2021 3:05 PM] tux_linux
look it up on google


[2/18/2021 3:05 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahahaha


[2/18/2021 3:06 PM] ferminolaiz
oooh yeah


[2/18/2021 3:06 PM] tux_linux
anyways I'm impressed that it just works


[2/18/2021 3:06 PM] tux_linux
I have to hold my breath everytime I take out the MicroSD


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] tux_linux
IT WOOOOOOOOOOOORKS


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] ferminolaiz
DOES IT


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] ferminolaiz
NICE


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] tux_linux
well it boots


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] ferminolaiz
THERE WE GOO


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] ferminolaiz
Arch on Kobo here we goo


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] tux_linux
ABSOLUTELY


[2/18/2021 3:08 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahahha


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] ferminolaiz
ACTUALLY


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] tux_linux
come in, squashfs, btrfs let's goo


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] ferminolaiz
There's an arch distro for raspberry


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] tux_linux
yep I know


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] ferminolaiz
sooo it wouldn't be tooo weird (?


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] tux_linux
no, but I was more looking at Debian


[2/18/2021 3:09 PM] ferminolaiz
For sure


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] ferminolaiz
It would break a lot less


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] tux_linux
especially
but imagine if we posted that on unixporn


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] tux_linux
"btw I use Arch ... on an eReader"


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] ferminolaiz
gentoo


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] tux_linux
HAHAHHAHA


[2/18/2021 3:10 PM] tux_linux
it'd take like 2 years to just even RUN


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
btw


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
This would be a HUGE project


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
And for sure we wouldn't be able to run it alone


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
BUT


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] tux_linux
yeah, Imagine if we got kexec for all Kobos (including emmcs) and we could run our proper distro!


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
If there is enough interested people at mobileread


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] ferminolaiz
it could be possible


[2/18/2021 3:11 PM] tux_linux
could, yes, I hope


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] tux_linux
I'll try kexec as soon as I convince me to unplug that serial thing


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] ferminolaiz
hahaha


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] tux_linux
(because putting it back again togheter won't be easy)


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] ferminolaiz
actually, you might just want to keep it plugged


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] tux_linux
Well I don't have TX on the RPI


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] ferminolaiz
You do, actually


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] ferminolaiz
It's the pin in between those two


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] tux_linux
but not plugged in


[2/18/2021 3:12 PM] ferminolaiz
Oh, yeah


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
so I have to enable SSH


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] ferminolaiz
But (I think, not sure though) you have the kernel log


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] ferminolaiz
idk if it closes the port after booting


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
no, you can login


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
I think it just says "invalid argument" because there's no TX ?


[2/18/2021 3:13 PM] ferminolaiz
ooh, that's why you were asking for it


[2/18/2021 3:14 PM] ferminolaiz
hm... if there is noise in the signal, yes


[2/18/2021 3:14 PM] ferminolaiz
But Im guessing that's another thing, though


[2/18/2021 3:14 PM] tux_linux
look at the Kindle dev's corner, there are plenty of jailbreak using serial also

[2/18/2021 3:20 PM] tux_linux
Well do you want to post something on Mobileread about it?


[2/18/2021 3:20 PM] ferminolaiz
I can't right now


[2/18/2021 3:20 PM] ferminolaiz
I must get back to work hahaha


[2/18/2021 3:21 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[2/18/2021 3:21 PM] ferminolaiz
btw, question


[2/18/2021 3:21 PM] ferminolaiz
Do you have any clues about how to write a kernel module?


[2/18/2021 3:21 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm just thinking about how to make modules that attach to the serial port


[2/18/2021 3:22 PM] ferminolaiz
(I mean hardware modules, but we'd need a kernel mod to use them properly)


[2/18/2021 3:27 PM] tux_linux
Hmm no


[2/18/2021 3:27 PM] tux_linux
I don't have any luck with that usually


[2/18/2021 3:28 PM] tux_linux
But before we can run anything on the Kobo, we have to upgrade the kernel to at least v4.1


[2/18/2021 3:28 PM] tux_linux
Otherwise neither Debian nor Arch will run


[2/18/2021 3:28 PM] ferminolaiz
right


[2/18/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
so I'll look at the kernel sources and try to make a working kernel (which is very unlikely to run, but anyways)


[2/18/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
but btw, did you look up for the second tx/rx line? I'd really need that with kexec


[2/18/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
otherwise I likely won't be able to see the kernel log


[2/18/2021 3:32 PM] tux_linux
but do it when you have time, I don't want to bother you with that


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] ferminolaiz
So yeah, you can connect it


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] ferminolaiz
I couldn't figure out for sure the voltages


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] ferminolaiz
But I guess it should be 3V3


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] ferminolaiz
3.3V*


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] tux_linux
yep it's that


[2/18/2021 3:52 PM] tux_linux
it didn't fry my Rpi up, so


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
Well, the other option is 1.8v


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
So if you send 1.8v instead of 3.3v to the rpi it would work


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
But maybe not reliable


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
Then if you send 3.3 instead of 1.8 to the kobo, well


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
I don't think you'll fry it, though


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] tux_linux
you mean it'd be possible to send tx/rx on one port?


[2/18/2021 3:53 PM] ferminolaiz
No


[2/18/2021 3:54 PM] tux_linux
then I'd be fine with 3.3v everywhere, right?


[2/18/2021 3:54 PM] ferminolaiz
Well, wait


[2/18/2021 3:54 PM] ferminolaiz
The thing is, we're not actually sure it's 3.3


[2/18/2021 3:54 PM] ferminolaiz
It could be running at 1.8 and the rpi could catch it just fine


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] tux_linux
but seeing web blog posts would confirm that it's 3.3


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
Nice


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] tux_linux
I'll try them on my Glo HD


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm assuming it's 3.3


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] tux_linux
again, not that bad if it fries up


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahaha


[2/18/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
It should work


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] ferminolaiz
Also the max rating for those ports in the proc is 3.6, so you should be safe


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] ferminolaiz
(there's a small corner case but I don't think it's the case here)


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
ok, but how do I add a wire to the dupont connector?


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] ferminolaiz
Well


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] ferminolaiz
You might have to use another one


[2/18/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/18/2021 3:57 PM] ferminolaiz
And then you connect it as follows:

[2/18/2021 4:03 PM] tux_linux
ooh


[2/18/2021 4:03 PM] tux_linux
ok that's nice


[2/18/2021 4:03 PM] ferminolaiz
(Dont mind the tip of the arrow, just where its pointing)


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] ferminolaiz
back**


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] tux_linux
doing school work right now, but as soon as my class finishes, I'll go and try to find another connector


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] ferminolaiz
So it would pin pins #6, #8, 10, #12 and #14


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] tux_linux
thx


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] ferminolaiz
And you'd use #6, #8 and #10


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] ferminolaiz
(Connect the cables)


[2/18/2021 4:04 PM] ferminolaiz
And you'd have a cable left over


[2/18/2021 4:05 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/18/2021 4:08 PM] tux_linux

that's great. execution didn't quite work though, but guess we'll know more about it when I hook up the other tx/rx line


[2/18/2021 6:26 PM] tux_linux

[2/18/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
let's hope nothing will blow up... and I turn on the rpi


[2/18/2021 6:37 PM] tux_linux
i got input


[2/18/2021 6:37 PM] tux_linux
Let's gooo


[2/18/2021 6:37 PM] ferminolaiz
Nice C:


[2/18/2021 6:40 PM] tux_linux
hmm the rpi is sending a login shell which causes uboot to strangely behave
do you know how to disable the login shell but keep serial enabled?


[2/18/2021 6:41 PM] ferminolaiz
`raspi-config`?


[2/18/2021 6:41 PM] tux_linux
no, you can only enable serial AND login shell


[2/18/2021 6:43 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/18/2021 6:43 PM] tux_linux
wait


[2/18/2021 6:45 PM] tux_linux
I GOT A LOGIN PROMPT
and I'm able to INPUT


[2/18/2021 6:47 PM] ferminolaiz
C:C:C:


[2/18/2021 6:47 PM] tux_linux
now the hard part is to connect it to the Mini


[2/18/2021 6:47 PM] tux_linux
(which will likely be impossible because I have to connect 3 wires)


[2/18/2021 6:48 PM] tux_linux
the glo hd it's easy because there's a recess under the holes


[2/18/2021 6:52 PM] tux_linux
ok, all things considered, I'm going to be trying to compile a new kernel for the GloHD, since accessing serial on the Mini is a nightmare


[2/18/2021 6:53 PM] tux_linux
probably gonna boot debian tonight or tommorow ^^


[2/18/2021 7:37 PM] tux_linux
ok so I got the serial hooked up and a new kernel compiled with the stock config.
When it boots, there's an error (again)

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-5B489.txt


[2/18/2021 7:37 PM] tux_linux
it seems it's related to cpu heavy load... though I don't think my Kobo is having a heavy load booting a kernel...


[2/18/2021 10:54 PM] tux_linux
ok so I gave up with the Glo HD and got back to the Mini
I enlarged the toothpicks' tips and now they fit tight and keep the connectors put.
kexec seems to work sometimes
however, I can't interrupt the boot process and get to the u-boot shell like I could on my Glo HD. It seems that input only gets there when the kernel starts. any clue?


[2/18/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
yep, kexec once started but now it hangs at
`Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.`


[2/18/2021 11:10 PM] ferminolaiz
What did you change?


[2/18/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
well nothing much... I don't even know why it decided to execute the kernel that time


[2/18/2021 11:29 PM] tux_linux
reconnected my Glo HD. got uboot console
I tried with my Aura too and it didn't work.
so strangely it's only the Glo HD


[2/18/2021 11:29 PM] ferminolaiz
Is there more than one port in the mini/aura?


[2/18/2021 11:30 PM] tux_linux
mini, no


[2/18/2021 11:30 PM] tux_linux
aura, yes there's one more


[2/18/2021 11:45 PM] tux_linux
I tested the Aura's other serial port, it doesn't output anything


[2/18/2021 11:56 PM] tux_linux
ok, inspecting the Mini's `/dev` shows that it has not only `ttymxc0`, but also `ttymxc1` and `ttymxc2`...


[2/18/2021 11:59 PM] tux_linux
huh. kexec works now


[2/18/2021 11:59 PM] tux_linux
will restart and see if it was too good to be true


[2/19/2021 1:20 AM] ferminolaiz
If you can open ttymxc0 and see stuff in your rpi then it means you're in the right one


[2/19/2021 1:20 AM] ferminolaiz
I really think it's always the first one


[2/19/2021 2:16 AM] ferminolaiz
I wrote it horribly


[2/19/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
I mean that usually the first port is the one used for the kernel log


[2/19/2021 2:17 AM] ferminolaiz
And that if you have doubts you can try by opening ttymxc0 and sending stuff from to the rpi


[2/19/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/19/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
yep I checked it's ttymxc0


[2/19/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
it seems that the kernel has a driver for handling serial input but u-boot doesn't, only for output...
that's sad


[2/19/2021 2:28 AM] tux_linux
anyways, I'll try compiling a newer kernel (probably 4.1 or 5.4) for the Mini, hoping that the config won't break
it will have multiple fileystems options (squashfs, btrfs, etc.) + kexec if we can get it to work


[2/19/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
@dill actually you could access a serial console
...
By hooking up the other end of the line to another Kobo
...
And then access it from telnet


[2/19/2021 3:37 PM] tux_linux
ok so kernel 2.6.35.3-kobox is out!
here's the uImage compatible with the Kobo Mini
features:
- Squashfs file system
- NFS server/client
- Btrfs
- Kexec syscall + atags
- ext2/ext3/ext4
- usb otg
- misc


[2/19/2021 4:30 PM] ferminolaiz
Woah!


[2/19/2021 4:30 PM] ferminolaiz
How did you do it??


[2/19/2021 4:46 PM] tux_linux
i changed the menuconfig


[2/19/2021 4:47 PM] tux_linux
I tried with lots of new kernels, but none of them booted. I don't have enough skills to "port" the 2.6 kernel tree to a newer one, so guess we'll stick with that unless someone else has the knowledge...
btw that was a really interesting read, we could use some tips provided in there for KoBox https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=202262

here's the new one with usb-otg support


[2/19/2021 4:50 PM] tux_linux
Do you think I should create a thread on MR with that, like "The modded kernels thread" where I would publish the uImages of modded kernels for each Kobo model?


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
WOT


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
That's awesome


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
And I also think we should have a repo for this too


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
Like starting off a clean working tree and keep all the modifications in different commits


[2/19/2021 5:04 PM] ferminolaiz
(make sure to have a working copy though hahaha)


[2/19/2021 5:05 PM] ferminolaiz
So that way (1) we can learn also and help without being (so) lost hahah and (2) keep track of things in case something goes wrong


[2/19/2021 5:06 PM] ferminolaiz
oh, btw, I still need to work on the image creation script


[2/19/2021 5:06 PM] ferminolaiz
But I don't think I'll have the time this days


[2/19/2021 5:06 PM] ferminolaiz
Maybe on monday :/


[2/19/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Ok I'll do that!
Thx


[2/19/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Why though?
oh, you meant the MR thread, right?


[2/19/2021 5:15 PM] tux_linux
I'm not sure we'll use it quite as it was planned. If I get real Alpine Linux booted on the Mini and somehow change the boot device, things could get ... interesting


[2/19/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
I'm also trying to build the KVM module so we can run a newer kernel with QEMU/KVM so it shouldn't be too slow


[2/19/2021 6:15 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap, the kindle thing


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] tux_linux
still, kvm would be awesome if it worked


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] ferminolaiz
In the meantime I can still put some time in the chroot method


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] tux_linux
imagine like
```# uname -a

[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] ferminolaiz
Which would be a good fit for some people


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] tux_linux
especially for emmcs


[2/19/2021 6:16 PM] tux_linux
still didn't figure out how to access the u-boot console on my mini


[2/19/2021 6:43 PM] tux_linux
OK so I got Debian 7 on my Mini almost boots but hangs there:

I'll take a look at the link

there's also tpaste.us which I like too


[2/19/2021 6:54 PM] ferminolaiz

[2/19/2021 6:55 PM] ferminolaiz
What debian version is it?


[2/19/2021 6:55 PM] tux_linux
wheezy


[2/19/2021 6:55 PM] tux_linux
(7)


[2/19/2021 6:55 PM] tux_linux
newer would likely not be able to boot due to the older kernel


[2/19/2021 6:57 PM] ferminolaiz
Right


[2/19/2021 6:58 PM] ferminolaiz
:/


[2/19/2021 7:00 PM] tux_linux

*we'll hope*


[2/19/2021 7:19 PM] tux_linux
anyways I'll boot it soon, it's finishing compiling now


[2/19/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
and... nope, it didn't. But I probably overloaded it with a gazilion options, so I'll try again just with the sound thing


[2/19/2021 7:58 PM] tux_linux
ok, got Debian 6 booted. no udevd error thing but it hangs the serial as soon as the green light stops blinking
also, there doesn't seem to be a ttymxc0 device node in /dev...


[2/19/2021 7:59 PM] ferminolaiz

oh no


[2/19/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
i mistakenly did ls /dev on my host machine


[2/19/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
wait a sec


[2/19/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
not much in fact:
```
[admin@phoenix sd]# ls dev
console  fd       full     initctl  null     ptmx     pts      random   shm      stderr   stdin    stdout   tty      urandom  zero
[admin@phoenix sd]# 
```


[2/19/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
but maybe that udev handles the creation of the device nodes on boot... so I don't know


[2/19/2021 8:06 PM] ferminolaiz
What about `tty`?


[2/19/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
hmm idk, what would it do? on kobo it's ttymxc0


[2/19/2021 8:06 PM] ferminolaiz
You can give it a shot


[2/19/2021 8:06 PM] ferminolaiz
Maybe by opening it and trying to send something to the rpi?


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
huh what?


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] ferminolaiz
Try it out*


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] ferminolaiz
hahaha


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
yeah, but how? the boot process hangs and I can't input anything


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
the `ls /dev` came from my Linux PC


[2/19/2021 8:07 PM] ferminolaiz
From the kobo itself


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] ferminolaiz
You're telnetting into the kobo, right?


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
serial


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] ferminolaiz
From the rpi?


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2021 8:08 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm lost with this then


[2/19/2021 8:09 PM] ferminolaiz
Are you talking about a different kernel build?


[2/19/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
yes, it's my custom one


[2/19/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
should I try with the default?


[2/19/2021 8:09 PM] ferminolaiz
I guess


[2/19/2021 8:09 PM] ferminolaiz
What is the problem, though?


[2/19/2021 8:10 PM] ferminolaiz
You're already inside debian, right?


[2/19/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
hmm yeah, wait... I remember that the serial too didn't work on the stock firmware once the green light stopped blinking...


[2/19/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
no it didn't boot up


[2/19/2021 8:10 PM] ferminolaiz
OH, you're talking about two different builds then


[2/19/2021 8:10 PM] ferminolaiz
It's probably because the kernel releases it after booting


[2/19/2021 8:11 PM] ferminolaiz
And so (1) it doesn't echo back what you send to it and (2) it doesn't send anything at all xD


[2/19/2021 8:11 PM] ferminolaiz
Maybe there's an option to enable the shell on the serial port


[2/19/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
yeah, basically
1. u-boot >> no input, but output
2. linux boots >> input, output
3. systemd starts up debian >> input, output and as soon as the green light stop flashing, no output nor input


[2/19/2021 8:12 PM] tux_linux
I'll try reimaging the sd, upgrading to latest firmware with latest hwcfg and mbr shenanigans, and then creating one ext2 partition for root and debootstrap debian into it


[2/19/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
https://wiki.debian.org/EmDebian/CrossDebootstrap
yep, it's there, but I forgot to make the device node. I don't think it's the problem though because the bootlog hung before a serial console could've been there, from what I could tell


[2/19/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
and giving that an after-thought, Debian 7 could maybe boot if the udevd error isn't fatal... because it hung too and I thought that that was what was causing the error...


[2/19/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
ok, got a login prompt, it was the kernel then.


[2/19/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
probably some menuconfig bug that I didn't see

[2/20/2021 3:27 AM] ferminolaiz
"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000005f
pgd = 80004000"


[2/20/2021 3:27 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll look it up


[2/20/2021 3:35 AM] ferminolaiz
The error is not super easy to track :/ it means the kernel is trying to access a pointer with address NULL (= no address)


[2/20/2021 3:35 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd try to disable all modules that are non essential


[2/20/2021 3:39 AM] tux_linux
I'll try with the stock config then


[2/20/2021 3:39 AM] tux_linux
I enabled devtmpfs for debian 8, we'll see if that's the culprit


[2/20/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
Right, be ready to hook up serial to your Clara HD 😉
We'll need it a lot for testing on mk. 7 devices...

[2/20/2021 4:00 AM] ferminolaiz
I forgot to send it, I found this


[2/20/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
no, initramfs is disabled in kernel


[2/20/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
I'm compiling with NickelTC now, we'll see if it makes any difference


[2/20/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
oh, now it works


[2/20/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
I'll try with CONFIG_DEVTMPFS


[2/20/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
`Spacebar stops the uboot and gets you the uboot command line.`
Ha! Not sure I tried that key yet on my Aura & Mini...

Kobo Aura?
I know this forum is all things Nook, but maybe you die-hard Nookies might be interested...
(If it is interesting and it goes somewhere it should be a different forum.)

Walmart is selling the Kobo Aura (Edition 2) for $69.99
Yup, this is the...

[2/20/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux what command do i use for dd


[2/20/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
`dd if=uImage of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=2048`


[2/20/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
and then `sync` and `reboot`


[2/20/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
👍


[2/20/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
thanks


[2/20/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
report back if it works!


[2/20/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
i have both of these... will they conflict?

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-8D133.png


[2/20/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
if they are not the same name, no


[2/20/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
but you can remove them both and only put the new one


[2/20/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[2/20/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
Test this sqsh after to see if the squashfs option worked well. `mount hi.sqsh /mnt/user`

[2/20/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
rebooting

[2/20/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
yep, all good


[2/20/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
...it's not connecting to my PC


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
it shows connected and charging, but the pc refuses to recognize it


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
huh


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
i'll ftp


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
can you stil access it with telnet/ssh?


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
i think so


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
that may be an unwanted side-effect


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
maybe the usb cable is faulty


[2/20/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
anyways, if you can still transfer via ftp, you're good


[2/20/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
or you could even `base64` the file and copy-paste via telnet haha


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
i try to connect with usb, then i unplug without ejecting because no way to eject... but then it reboots


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
ok definitely kernel problem then :/


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
can you telnet still?


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
i'll dd the uImage-orig


[2/20/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
wait


[2/20/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
ok nvm I'll debug that on my Mini later on


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
scanning for networks, but not working


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
But I'd still keep the kernel if I was you
squashfs offers some big advantages
and ftp on my side would not be a big hassle

but do it how you want! and hopefully I'll get this usb issue sorted out


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
ooooohh
that's because the module was not compiled


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
that's easily fixable


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
I'll send you a txz of the modules that you'll replace in /drivers later


[2/20/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
alright


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
but yeah, now it's a better idea to reflash this uimage-orig after giving it an after-thought


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
no idea how, other than taking out the sd


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
but no


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
hmm wait, I'll send you some modules now


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
i'll just reboot and see


[2/20/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
taking out the sd is pretty easy now


[2/20/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
yep, but flashing won't be on windows
unless it passes through the devices


[2/20/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
i'm just gonna hard reset


[2/20/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
oh you could, true


[2/20/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
i have a backup image of my mini


[2/20/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
so i'll just etch that


[2/20/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
but theoritically you could just hit the reset button on the device and it'd work


[2/20/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
or `devmodeon` then Device Information > Developer options > factory reset


[2/20/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
nope, i tried that so many times in the past... my mini just rebots :\


[2/20/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
ok, devmode


[2/20/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
yeah reset button doesn't work well on mine either


[2/20/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
but devmode on reset does like a charm though


[2/20/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/20/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
resetting, and i have to go :/


[2/20/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
ok, bye!


[2/20/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
so please PM me the modules, (or debug) and I'll test that on my Mini


[2/20/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
bye!


[2/20/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
okk


[2/20/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
bye


[2/20/2021 5:59 AM] tux_linux

Debian 8 on the Glo HD!


[2/20/2021 6:01 AM] tux_linux
who said that a Kobo couldn't run systemd?


[2/20/2021 6:57 AM] tux_linux
tomorrow I'll try Alpine Linux


[2/20/2021 3:45 PM] tux_linux
ok, so I got Alpine running. OpenRC starts up but complains about missing /dev/tty* devices and I can't get to a login prompt.
I'll investigate on this and come back when I hopefully get something working...!


[2/20/2021 8:29 PM] the.mightydill
debian!!


[2/20/2021 8:29 PM] the.mightydill
niceeee


[2/20/2021 8:30 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux is there a fix for the mini kernel yet? just asking, squashfs would be amazing


[2/20/2021 8:35 PM] tux_linux
well, it's coming up, maybe tonight, 7-8PM EST


[2/20/2021 8:35 PM] tux_linux
for now I got Alpine running! and a serial console!


[2/20/2021 8:35 PM] tux_linux
will post bootlog soon


[2/20/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
wooo


[2/20/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
on what device?


[2/20/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
no rush :)


[2/20/2021 8:41 PM] tux_linux
on the Glo HD


[2/20/2021 8:41 PM] tux_linux
should work on the Mini too, haven't tested it yet


[2/20/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
https://pv.olaiz.net/?7d27b683760cd3da#CKQAvDtYx9ngw8yk9PSx1KvvkNdVfm9g3NAw2VjhRMeJ


[2/20/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
wow!


[2/20/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
i can test on mini rn if you want


[2/20/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
would it be a uImage or a disk image?


[2/20/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
and would i have to flash the image, or just mount it like kobox


[2/20/2021 9:13 PM] tux_linux
no it'd be a complete SD image


[2/20/2021 9:14 PM] tux_linux
you wouldn't have access to Nickel anymore
(well, dual-boot is possible, but that needs to be further investigated)


[2/20/2021 9:15 PM] tux_linux
no you couldn't (well you wouldn't see any progress) because it needs to be hooked up to serial to see any results


[2/20/2021 9:16 PM] tux_linux
though, you *could* access serial by finding three wires and hooking up your Aura's serial port to the Mini's one.
then, microcom on the Aura via SSH and you'd have serial access to the Mini


[2/20/2021 9:16 PM] the.mightydill
aura is unopenable...


[2/20/2021 9:16 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/20/2021 9:17 PM] tux_linux
well then, you'd be stuck with a blinking light and a blank screen


[2/20/2021 9:17 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, because it has *extremely tiny screws*


[2/20/2021 9:17 PM] the.mightydill
dang


[2/20/2021 9:17 PM] tux_linux
how tiny?


[2/20/2021 9:17 PM] the.mightydill
less than 1mm


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] the.mightydill
and they're six sided too


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] tux_linux
ouuch


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] tux_linux
that hurts


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] the.mightydill
it was painful when the usb port broke, i paid 70 bucks to get it fixed


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] tux_linux
where did it get fixed?


[2/20/2021 9:18 PM] the.mightydill
had to bring it to a repair place


[2/20/2021 9:19 PM] tux_linux
that hurts too


[2/20/2021 9:19 PM] the.mightydill
definitely


[2/20/2021 9:19 PM] tux_linux
but couldn't you have asked the repair people how they opened it? xD


[2/20/2021 9:19 PM] the.mightydill
it was my dad who got it fixed so idk


[2/20/2021 9:19 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/20/2021 9:20 PM] tux_linux
it's an aura h2o v2?


[2/20/2021 9:20 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/20/2021 9:20 PM] the.mightydill
gotta go bye


[2/20/2021 9:20 PM] tux_linux
bye

any repo yet?

`-rw-r--r-- 1 fermino fermino 4.8M Feb 20 19:39 84a5702-1G.img.txz`

Not yet, but I'll upload it soon


[2/20/2021 11:40 PM] tux_linux
great!


[2/20/2021 11:40 PM] ferminolaiz
`4.8M`


[2/20/2021 11:40 PM] ferminolaiz
There are all zeroes, right? xD


[2/20/2021 11:40 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/20/2021 11:41 PM] ferminolaiz
Would you mind giving it a shot? I need to go do a couple of things but I have an image ready


[2/20/2021 11:41 PM] tux_linux
sure!
it'd be a life saver, setupping all of those Kobos each time it breaks is a pain


[2/20/2021 11:42 PM] ferminolaiz
That's it


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] ferminolaiz
So, the idea is that *every* time we push to `master`, it will trigger this script in the server, which would build the images and publish them in an http server


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm uploading the img rn


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] tux_linux
also, if you could please help me with that.......

like this appeared from absolutely nowhere when building 3.0.35 for the Glo HD


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] ferminolaiz
And yeah, it shoould work, I still have some doubts about a file ownership thing but it *should* work anyways


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] tux_linux
yep that's nice


[2/20/2021 11:43 PM] ferminolaiz
hahaha


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] ferminolaiz
did you do a `make clean` before compiling?


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] ferminolaiz
That happens because the linker (the one that links already compiled files) can't file some functions that are supposed to be defined in an already compiled file


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] ferminolaiz
disable the sound module


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] ferminolaiz
it's either sound or usb-otg


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] tux_linux
hmm no, but never got errors with that before


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/20/2021 11:45 PM] tux_linux
I'll try a `make clean` with the same config, then disabling the usb/sound modules if it doesn't work


[2/20/2021 11:46 PM] ferminolaiz
oks


[2/20/2021 11:49 PM] ferminolaiz
oh btw, the resolv.conf is still missing, as it's actually building from `master` in the repo


[2/20/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
shouldn't be to worry


[2/20/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux
it's created when we chroot in, or...
oh yeah, could be a good idea just to `touch` it if we want to bind-mount...


[2/20/2021 11:50 PM] ferminolaiz
That's why I made the issue the other day


[2/20/2021 11:51 PM] ferminolaiz
tbh we could make an "installer", a script that sets everything up and cp's the resolv config, but in the meantime we can just do it manually/add it in the repo


[2/20/2021 11:51 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/20/2021 11:51 PM] tux_linux
also, you could add your script to the bootstrap repo, it has a good place there I think 🙂


[2/20/2021 11:51 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/20/2021 11:51 PM] ferminolaiz
I'll do


[2/20/2021 11:52 PM] tux_linux
nice


[2/20/2021 11:52 PM] ferminolaiz
But first it needs to work xD


[2/20/2021 11:52 PM] tux_linux
yeah, of course
you might as well add a "WIP - Experimental, could turn your Kobo into a time bomb" or the like haha


[2/20/2021 11:52 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahah yeah


[2/21/2021 12:01 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, my connection is unusable :c


[2/21/2021 12:01 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/21/2021 12:01 AM] ferminolaiz
I can't even post the file


[2/21/2021 12:01 AM] tux_linux
maybe send the script here in Discord and I'll upload it myself (crediting you of course)


[2/21/2021 12:02 AM] ferminolaiz
That's fine! I can use git, though


[2/21/2021 12:02 AM] ferminolaiz
But uploading the 5M file is too much


[2/21/2021 12:03 AM] tux_linux
Hmm
`mksquashfs <file.txz> archive.sqsh -b 1048576 -comp xz -Xdict-size 100% -always-use-fragments`


[2/21/2021 12:03 AM] tux_linux
that should reduce the size of the txz
I use that to create my Archiso's squashfs root


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] ferminolaiz
I have to install it first D:


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] ferminolaiz
hahaha


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
i think the pkg size is like 1M


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] ferminolaiz
is not even on the repos ._.


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
squashfs-tools ?


[2/21/2021 12:04 AM] ferminolaiz
oh, that


[2/21/2021 12:05 AM] ferminolaiz
There we go, thx


[2/21/2021 12:05 AM] tux_linux
FWIW, it compresses a 8G filesystem into a 2.6G mountable read-only archive


[2/21/2021 12:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Almost same filesize


[2/21/2021 12:06 AM] ferminolaiz
bc it's already super compressed


[2/21/2021 12:06 AM] tux_linux
oh then your xz did well its job


[2/21/2021 12:06 AM] ferminolaiz
yeap


[2/21/2021 12:06 AM] tux_linux
but... I mean. could you tell git to push and even wait hours for it to complete, or is it just stuck there?


[2/21/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
and also if you could provide the script it'd be enough for me I think


[2/21/2021 12:07 AM] ferminolaiz
I'm pushing rn to the repo


[2/21/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/21/2021 12:10 AM] ferminolaiz
There's one thing I couldn't figure out, maybe you can help me with that


[2/21/2021 12:10 AM] tux_linux
yep?


[2/21/2021 12:10 AM] ferminolaiz
When the image is created, the uid for it is root


[2/21/2021 12:10 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/21/2021 12:11 AM] ferminolaiz
So, when I mount it with udisksctl, even if I can mount as a normal user, I can't create folders inside it


[2/21/2021 12:11 AM] ferminolaiz
The dirty workaround is to create all necessary folders under `/`  in the image, and chown them to the user running the script


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] ferminolaiz
BUT it is not technically correct either


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
well what are the files in the root of the image owned by?


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] ferminolaiz
Here's the thing, they *should* be owned by root


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
if they are owned by root, then a normal user sure won't be able to create anything inside


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/21/2021 12:12 AM] ferminolaiz
if not, when you access the image from the chroot, it would show another UID


[2/21/2021 12:13 AM] ferminolaiz
(it would not be a problem, I think, but still)


[2/21/2021 12:13 AM] tux_linux
well that's strange


[2/21/2021 12:13 AM] ferminolaiz
And the thing is that running a deploying script like this as root is a no go


[2/21/2021 12:13 AM] tux_linux
`fakeroot` ?


[2/21/2021 12:13 AM] tux_linux
you compress it into a txz after... should do the trick


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Hm...


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Maybe if we do the compression inside the fakeroot


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, that's probably going to work


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] tux_linux
yep, that's what makepkg always does


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] tux_linux
`Entering fakeroot...`


[2/21/2021 12:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Right


[2/21/2021 12:15 AM] ferminolaiz
Well...


[2/21/2021 12:15 AM] ferminolaiz
Hm... No


[2/21/2021 12:15 AM] ferminolaiz
Here's the thing, the .img files are still being mounted by root


[2/21/2021 12:16 AM] tux_linux
`FUSE`?


[2/21/2021 12:16 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, I should look at it


[2/21/2021 12:16 AM] ferminolaiz
In any case, I have to leave


[2/21/2021 12:17 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/21/2021 12:17 AM] tux_linux
see you later!


[2/21/2021 12:17 AM] ferminolaiz
see ya!


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, the easy workaround is a cron the fixes them


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] ferminolaiz
And compresses them


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] tux_linux
cron ? huh, what?


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, it will not be pretty but it will work well hahaha


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] tux_linux
but what do you mean exactly?


[2/21/2021 12:19 AM] ferminolaiz
a cron that runs as root that mounts the images, chowns everything and then sends it to the final server


[2/21/2021 12:20 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah


[2/21/2021 12:20 AM] tux_linux
but you should try FUSE, shouldn't be that hard to set up (well I know we're all reluctant when new things like that come into play, but... we have to experiment with them... although I'm definitely not a fan of snaps haha)


[2/21/2021 12:21 AM] ferminolaiz
the thing is


[2/21/2021 12:21 AM] ferminolaiz
~time~


[2/21/2021 12:21 AM] ferminolaiz
hahahah


[2/21/2021 12:21 AM] tux_linux
yeahhhhh


[2/21/2021 12:22 AM] tux_linux
but to give you an idea, here's how to mount a squashfs with fuse:
`squashfuse $HOME/Documents/fonts.sqsh /usr/share/fonts/additional`


[2/21/2021 12:22 AM] ferminolaiz
Then, with fuse


[2/21/2021 12:22 AM] ferminolaiz
Can a normal user have full control over a filesystem?


[2/21/2021 12:22 AM] ferminolaiz
Even modifying the file owner?


[2/21/2021 12:23 AM] tux_linux
i think so, yes


[2/21/2021 12:23 AM] tux_linux
`Filesystem in User SpacE`


[2/21/2021 12:24 AM] tux_linux
but then, why not just mount the image with `sudo`?


[2/21/2021 12:24 AM] tux_linux
shouldn't do *that* much harm


[2/21/2021 12:24 AM] ferminolaiz
because it's triggered through a webhook


[2/21/2021 12:24 AM] ferminolaiz
= an http endpoint


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] ferminolaiz
So a webserver, publicly accessible should *never ever* be running as root


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] tux_linux
yeah, ok....


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] tux_linux
then set up a QEMU virtual machine and mount the img there
edit: no it's wayy too overkill


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] ferminolaiz
Because at the slightest bug or anything whoever person could take advantage of that


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll go with fuse


[2/21/2021 12:25 AM] ferminolaiz
HAHAHA


[2/21/2021 12:26 AM] tux_linux
yep, should be better


[2/21/2021 12:26 AM] tux_linux
fuse+fakeroot should to the trick


[2/21/2021 12:58 AM] tux_linux
It's out!

@fermino 
now that NFS support is enabled in-kernel, we should be able to host some sort of git instance on the Kobo!


[2/21/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction 
OK, so as a side-project more or less related to KoBox:
Since I had success running Alpine Linux entirely on the Kobo, I'd like to develop myself an embedded system for my Kobo using a *coughs* recent Qt framework and Qt Web Engine. It would probably include an open-source reader framework or in-house developed one. I.e. an open source Nickel. Since your Manga reader was in Qt, I think you're the one who knows most about it in this server. So, I have some questions for you (and to anyone who knows about an answer);
1. On what system should it be run? I think Alpine is fine, but I don't know if musl-libc is ideal for it... but also, I've seen Yocto and BuildRoot, those seem pretty interesting...
2. What's the learning curve? I know some Python and C. Qt is mostly C++, right? Don't worry, if you say "very hard" I'll give it a try anyways I think haha
3. any other recommendations/warning/emergencies like "doooon't do thiiss" or the like?
thanks!


[2/21/2021 5:17 PM] officeraction.
hey


[2/21/2021 5:19 PM] officeraction.
qt is not so hard and c++ is quite steep but once you can work with it it will make life much easier compared to c. Especially memory management was impossible on UMR before I was using smart pointers, crashes everywhere.


[2/21/2021 5:22 PM] officeraction.
I am running on the latest gcc and qt framework so that is for the the stock kobo kernel, you can just use them as is.


[2/21/2021 5:24 PM] officeraction.
qtwebengine is another story, but it *might* even be possible to just use the musl qtwebengine together with the rest if musl is linked statically. something I wanted to try for some time


[2/21/2021 5:27 PM] officeraction.
my suggestion is to just stick with the stock kernel since it makes everything much simpler


[2/21/2021 5:30 PM] officeraction.
i found qtcreator to be actually quite usefull for developing, since you can swich targets (kobo or desktop) with just one click and testing apps is also as easy. one click and it will build the app,
 transfer it to the kobo and run it.


[2/21/2021 6:39 PM] tux_linux
that is actually mandatory for the device to even boot, as compiling other kernels is just... a pain, you have to backport drivers and all of that...
but I'll use the stock kernel, perhaps with a few options added to the config.
I'm planning to build for the Mini and up, so GCC 10 won't do as it doesn't like the 2.6.35.3 kernel the Mini has. I'll likely use GCC 8
So should I stick with Alpine, or Buildroot/Yocto with OpenRC and maybe glibc instead of musl-libc or uclibc-ng?
also, could you provide me a simple "Hello World" like program (qt) which would just print "Hello World" centered on the screen? that would help me, really and maybe lead me to install missing things if they are.
again, thanks for your time and your response!


[2/21/2021 7:06 PM] tux_linux
that seems like a good place to start for qt on kobos (qt5 is also there)

im not sure why you want to setup your own system with alpine, ect...


[2/21/2021 7:32 PM] officeraction.
just use the crosscompiler from the xtoolchain repo its all you neend


[2/21/2021 7:32 PM] tux_linux
I'd like to have a proper service manager and truly choose what I'm including in it


[2/21/2021 7:33 PM] officeraction.
ok up to you ofc


[2/21/2021 7:33 PM] tux_linux
and make all the rootfs open source


[2/21/2021 7:33 PM] officeraction.
the umr repo has instructions on how to compile qt for kobo


[2/21/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
but what's "umr"?

ultimate manga reader


[2/21/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
ohhh


[2/21/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
that's great, I'll look into it


[2/21/2021 7:34 PM] officeraction.
also you will need platform plugin for kobo

i also have a repo for that but it's not certain if it will work for the mini out of the box maybe you will need to make some adjustments


[2/21/2021 7:35 PM] officeraction.
yep


[2/21/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
sure, I'm prepared
it's pretty sure it'll throw at me an error that didn't even existed 3 seconds before (no offense)


[2/21/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
but I'm ready


[2/21/2021 7:36 PM] officeraction.
most likely there wont be an error but the touchscreen inputs are off


[2/21/2021 7:37 PM] officeraction.
well maybe i can help you fix that if its needed


[2/21/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
thanks.
so
1. get alpine/yocto/buildroot up and running
2. compile Qt platform plugin
3. Put libraries/binaries in rootfs
4. compile program with qmake/make or qtcreator
5. run the program and fix the trillion issues that (with my IT bad luck) will likely come with it
6. start creating an UI and hopefully don't give up


[2/21/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
right?


[2/21/2021 7:39 PM] officeraction.
sounds right


[2/21/2021 7:40 PM] tux_linux
ok so I'll start to try things out
will come back (hopefully) when I get the platform plugin compiled and the kobo running
thanks again


[2/21/2021 7:41 PM] tux_linux
humm... which toolchain to use?
maybe koxtoolchain?


[2/21/2021 7:41 PM] officeraction.
koxtoolchain is what i am using


[2/21/2021 7:42 PM] officeraction.
its basically crosstool-ng with a nice config for kobos


[2/21/2021 7:43 PM] tux_linux
yep
So I'll go with that for Qt, and for the rootfs I'll use the stock one provided by yocto/buildroot if I go with that


[2/21/2021 7:43 PM] tux_linux
thx


[2/21/2021 7:44 PM] officeraction.
you can just try with the stock kobo first. it will also work.


[2/21/2021 7:44 PM] tux_linux
also


[2/21/2021 7:44 PM] tux_linux
I'll see


[2/21/2021 7:46 PM] officeraction.
and btw I have a strong feeling gcc 10 will also work for you because umr is built with that and it's also running on older devices afik 😉


[2/21/2021 7:47 PM] tux_linux
maybe... but Alpine's musl-libc causes busybox to segfault on the Mini
and if recompiled with gcc-8 it doesn't segfault anymore


[2/21/2021 7:47 PM] officeraction.
🤷


[2/21/2021 7:47 PM] tux_linux
but maybe it's just musl-libc the problem too


[2/21/2021 7:47 PM] officeraction.
maybe


[2/21/2021 7:48 PM] officeraction.
i can give you an scribble app you can use that for testing

[2/21/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
will touch input work?

touchinputs are handled by the platform plugin


[2/21/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/21/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
that's nice


[2/21/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
I won't have to bother too much with that then


[2/21/2021 8:05 PM] officeraction.
yea after you get it running 😉

You might find useful adding these lines to the (end) of the rcS:
```insmod /drivers/<path to driver, e.g. arcotg_udc.ko>
insmod /drivers/<path to driver, e.g. g_ether.ko>
ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.2

read the readme


[2/23/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
did i miss an arg?

[2/23/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/23/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[2/23/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
in the tar.xz the folder is named "modules/

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-3C616.png


[2/23/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah, doesn't matter


[2/23/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
i'll update the readme


[2/23/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
got it


[2/23/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
just to confirm, this is the contents of modules/?

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-3EA87.png


[2/23/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/23/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
copy only the modules you need


[2/23/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
inspect /drivers and replace them if they are there


[2/23/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
I included the others, but some are not needed


[2/23/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
and do i copy modules/, or the contents of modules/?


[2/23/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
the contents


[2/23/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
like if a /drivers/imx508-whatever/g_ether.ko is there, replace the g_ether.ko with the one in the tar.xz


[2/23/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
which one

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-5220C.png


[2/23/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
ntx508


[2/23/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
if a module is already there do i replace it


[2/23/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/23/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
you must replace it or it won't run


[2/23/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[2/23/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
i have no idea where to put some of these


[2/23/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
if they're not already in the folders, then they're not needed


[2/23/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
got it


[2/23/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
so i only replace


[2/23/2021 4:59 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
just dd'ed


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
`sync && reboot`


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
🤞


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
and cross your fingers


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[2/23/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
you read my mind


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
haha yes


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
yaaay its booting


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
good sign


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
seens to be a bit of a small e-ink render error


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
ooooh
i think that's because I enabled auto-update


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
like it's useful for Xorg


[2/23/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
but yeah, I know what you mean


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
so auto refresh on eink?


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
I'll disable it and publish another version


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
how do i disable it rn


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
no way


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
i have to go


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
i can live with it dont worry


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
like it's in the .config file


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
not that big


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
but I'll change it soon


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
ok bye


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
bye


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
WAIT


[2/23/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
im gonna do hi.sqsh first


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
you can actually telnet?


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
no


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
i'll use konsole


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
oooh yeah


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
well that should work no problem


[2/23/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
you'll see how it's useful


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
what cmd


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
something like
`mount hi.sqsh /mnt/user`


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
xz compression with that compressed an 8G filesystem into a 2.6G one


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
never mind i forgot to update kfmon


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/23/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
gtg, i'll try tmro


[2/23/2021 5:08 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[2/23/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
it *should* be possible with usbms


[2/23/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
bye


[2/23/2021 6:36 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction do you have any pointers to build Qt for musl? I tried, but everything seems designed as if I had to use glibc. Also, Cmake gave me unrecognized options errors while trying to configure.
Thanks!


[2/23/2021 12:33 PM] officeraction.
Hey for clarification: the libc that it beeing linked to is the one that the toolchain is using. so its glibc for the koxtoolchain. if you want musl you just do the same build but with the musl cross toolchain.


[2/23/2021 12:34 PM] officeraction.
alternatively you can also configure the koxtoolchain for musl but than you have to rebuild the whole thing


[2/23/2021 1:34 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, I used a musl cross toolchain.
Well I didn't get that far, because in fact CMake have me errors like "-verbose : option not found"
When I saw that I thought CMake was having a really bad time

[2/23/2021 1:36 PM] tux_linux
Also, looking at the mkspec folder your mentioned, everything seems to be prepared for a glibc build


[2/23/2021 1:53 PM] tux_linux
ok, so configuring with this command outputs that

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-17D54.txt


[2/23/2021 1:56 PM] tux_linux
then it says the same thing for "-verbose", I remove the two and it says
```CMake Error at qtbase/cmake/QtProcessConfigureArgs.cmake:472 (message):
  Assigning unknown variable 'OPENSSL_PREFIX' on command line.```
also, I changed the `-xplatform` flag now and added the `mmusl` option

you, see I'm damned


[2/23/2021 2:22 PM] tux_linux
ha... suddenly building LFS for my Kobo seems very tempting...


[2/23/2021 2:29 PM] officeraction.
did you add a mkspec for linux-kobo-musleabihf-g++ ?


[2/23/2021 2:30 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/23/2021 2:33 PM] officeraction.
something is very strange there..


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] tux_linux
as always with me


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] officeraction.
are you calling that in the qtbase dir


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] tux_linux
I also tried in the qt5 main dir


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] officeraction.
because you have to do that in the main qt dir


[2/23/2021 2:34 PM] tux_linux
yeah, didn't work either


[2/23/2021 2:35 PM] officeraction.
well it should tho 😂


[2/23/2021 2:35 PM] officeraction.
maybe you have to refresh the dir (extract it again from the archive)


[2/23/2021 2:35 PM] tux_linux
I already did a git clean


[2/23/2021 2:36 PM] officeraction.
i made the experience that very often i can't build again no matter what after i get an error


[2/23/2021 2:36 PM] tux_linux
well, could you provide me a link of the qt5 tgz you're building with? that could help narrow things a bit


[2/23/2021 2:36 PM] tux_linux
and on my side I'm going to start building LFS on my RPi


[2/23/2021 2:37 PM] officeraction.
its just the 5.15.2 release


[2/23/2021 2:37 PM] officeraction.
i could send you my build but thats for glibc 😉


[2/23/2021 2:38 PM] tux_linux
yeah, that's what I should have downloaded


[2/23/2021 2:38 PM] tux_linux
I think I'll abandon musl for now
you see, LFS builds a glibc rootfs


[2/23/2021 2:53 PM] tux_linux
well I'll try as a last resort this tarball along with the howto http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/qt5.html


[2/23/2021 2:54 PM] officeraction.
yea thats the official release


[2/23/2021 2:54 PM] officeraction.
in the link


[2/23/2021 2:54 PM] tux_linux
we'll see


[2/23/2021 7:57 PM] tux_linux
well, could you send me the link of your glibc build? I was thinking about using Alpine linux as the main OS and using various debian chroots for modules (like the UI) so it has glibc


[2/23/2021 8:05 PM] officeraction.
sure


[2/23/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
thx


[2/23/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
also, it'd be debian 6, like Glibc from 2014, would that do?
max I can install is debian 7


[2/23/2021 8:07 PM] officeraction.
dont see why it wouldn't


[2/23/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
well, older version ?


[2/23/2021 8:08 PM] officeraction.
i think it should work either way


[2/23/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/23/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
great then!


[2/23/2021 8:13 PM] officeraction.
actually i also have a musl build lol


[2/23/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
oooooooooooooooooh


[2/23/2021 8:13 PM] officeraction.
you can try that as well


[2/23/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
ofc


[2/23/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
either way I'll set up Qt in a container-like fashion
it'll be easier to upgrade/fix/modify


[2/23/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
but which distro do you use to build it?


[2/23/2021 8:15 PM] officeraction.
i use manjaro as my daily driver

[2/23/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
oh I was on Ubuntu to make sure I had all the necessary things
normally I'd be using Arch
maybe I should try on Arch instead?


[2/23/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
thanks for the link btw


[2/23/2021 8:16 PM] officeraction.
manjaro is an arch distro id recomend that


[2/23/2021 8:17 PM] officeraction.
its all the power of arch with an easy environment like ubuntu


[2/23/2021 8:17 PM] officeraction.
but without all the cancer 😄


[2/23/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
well I don't think it's so hard


[2/23/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
let me tell you, when you've done Linux From Scratch and Gentoo, Arch is like easy-peasy


[2/23/2021 8:18 PM] officeraction.
the cancer was refering to ubuntu😂


[2/23/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
oh yeah


[2/23/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
that I agree completely


[2/23/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
it has so much garbage


[2/23/2021 8:19 PM] officeraction.
yep and random ass errors


[2/23/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
yeah
"Ubuntu 20.10 has encountered an internal error"
ahhhhh

[2/23/2021 8:59 PM] tux_linux
did you not compile that for x86_64?


[2/23/2021 8:59 PM] officeraction.
it is


[2/23/2021 8:59 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/23/2021 8:59 PM] tux_linux
but then


[2/23/2021 8:59 PM] officeraction.
its working for me so maybe some toolchain dependency mismatch


[2/23/2021 9:00 PM] officeraction.
no idea


[2/23/2021 9:00 PM] tux_linux
you use that for qt to create binaries that you transplant in the kobo


[2/23/2021 9:00 PM] tux_linux
without qt in the kobo


[2/23/2021 9:00 PM] tux_linux
is it?


[2/23/2021 9:00 PM] officeraction.
yea


[2/23/2021 9:01 PM] tux_linux
whew I missed something


[2/23/2021 9:01 PM] tux_linux
i was trying to compile with an armv7l toolchain lmao


[2/23/2021 9:01 PM] tux_linux
that's probably why it didn't work


[2/23/2021 9:01 PM] tux_linux
I thought you needed the qt lib on the kobo to run qt programs on it


[2/23/2021 9:01 PM] officeraction.
um


[2/23/2021 9:02 PM] officeraction.
yea you need the libs on the kobo


[2/23/2021 9:02 PM] officeraction.
but qmake is for the host for compiling


[2/23/2021 9:02 PM] tux_linux
oh
so
if I want to run the scribble program on the kobo, what do I need to do?


[2/23/2021 9:14 PM] officeraction.
you will need to modify the mkspec so it points to your toolchain compiler, you need to setup qtcreator with the qt package, you need to download and compile my platformplugin, then compile the scribble, you need to put all the nessasary qt libs on the kobo and add the platform plugin to the plugin/platform folder, then put scribble on the kobo as well 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QTPATH}/lib:lib:
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo
./scribble should get it running


[2/23/2021 9:14 PM] officeraction.
but actually i suggest you try the glibc version first because it will run on the kobo without any chroot and has much less pitfalls


[2/23/2021 9:16 PM] tux_linux
ok that's a lot
I'll probably ask you some questions about that, not sure if I'll get through this without help
thx


[2/23/2021 9:16 PM] officeraction.
sure


[2/23/2021 9:24 PM] tux_linux
but how to modify the mkspec if you already provided me the binaries?


[2/23/2021 9:24 PM] officeraction.
the same folder is in there


[2/23/2021 9:24 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/23/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
and for the qt libs? I find them where?


[2/23/2021 9:43 PM] officeraction.
in the libs folder 😉


[2/23/2021 9:43 PM] tux_linux
oh so they're already compiled for armv7l


[2/23/2021 9:43 PM] tux_linux
right?


[2/23/2021 9:43 PM] officeraction.
yep


[2/23/2021 9:44 PM] tux_linux
so only the bin folder is for x86_64


[2/23/2021 9:44 PM] officeraction.
yep its setup for crosscompiling


[2/23/2021 9:44 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/23/2021 9:58 PM] tux_linux
how to set up qt creator with the qt package?


[2/23/2021 10:01 PM] officeraction.
options -> kits -> add compiler, qt, and kit


[2/23/2021 10:02 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/23/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
why is there that?

and then?


[2/23/2021 10:07 PM] tux_linux
I just import the project?


[2/23/2021 10:07 PM] officeraction.
yea


[2/23/2021 10:08 PM] officeraction.
if you have put it all in a kit you can compile with that

qt


[2/23/2021 10:10 PM] tux_linux
how?


[2/23/2021 10:10 PM] officeraction.
add in qt tab


[2/23/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
but why is it still showing a warning sign?

[2/23/2021 10:15 PM] officeraction.
just hover over it maybe because of gdb


[2/23/2021 10:15 PM] tux_linux
warning no device set


[2/23/2021 10:16 PM] officeraction.
you can set that optionally


[2/23/2021 10:17 PM] tux_linux
ok so it'll not be fatal


[2/23/2021 10:17 PM] officeraction.
its nice it will deploy automatically

yea as it says... you are missing some dependencies in you sysroot


[2/23/2021 10:26 PM] officeraction.
i guess i can send you that aswell


[2/23/2021 10:28 PM] tux_linux
thx

is that normal?

[2/23/2021 10:32 PM] officeraction.
yea for me...


[2/23/2021 10:33 PM] officeraction.
maybe you have to add a symlink to your sysroot


[2/23/2021 10:33 PM] tux_linux
well I don't have anything in my sysroot

`armv7l-linux-musleabihf-g++ --sysroot=/home/andreas/x-tools/arm-kobo-linux-musleabihf/arm-kobo-linux-musleabihf/sysroot` but how does it know that? I deleted the pro.user file and it still does that


[2/23/2021 10:38 PM] officeraction.
qt is configured that way


[2/23/2021 10:39 PM] officeraction.
not sure how you can change it afterwards


[2/23/2021 10:39 PM] officeraction.
google around a bit or you can just create a simlink with that name and point it to your sysroot


[2/23/2021 10:39 PM] tux_linux
yeah that's what I'll do


[2/23/2021 10:39 PM] tux_linux
or actually create the folder


[2/24/2021 12:16 AM] tux_linux
ok, just to be sure, I put everything except the bin folder in the kobo?


[2/24/2021 12:19 AM] officeraction.
just the lib dir


[2/24/2021 12:19 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/24/2021 12:19 AM] tux_linux
and dumb question, but where does qtcreator place the binaries?


[2/24/2021 12:19 AM] officeraction.
?


[2/24/2021 12:19 AM] tux_linux
like, when I build, where is the output?


[2/24/2021 12:20 AM] officeraction.
there is a build folder


[2/24/2021 12:20 AM] officeraction.
you can check in the project settings


[2/24/2021 12:20 AM] tux_linux
oh thanks, I didn't see it


[2/24/2021 12:30 AM] tux_linux
sorry again,
how do I have to put the platform plugin?


[2/24/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
I saw a plugins/ directory, but do I keep the original folder name (qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo-musl) ?

woo nice


[2/24/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
is there a way to remove the auto update @tux-linux


[2/24/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
hmm yeah; dealing with some serial issues now
I might publish it for tommorrow


[2/24/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
ok, sure


[2/24/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
ok, issue solved


[2/24/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
will compile it now


[2/24/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
did squashfs work?


[2/24/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
mounted and rebooting


[2/24/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
gotta go :\


[2/24/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
ok bye


[2/24/2021 6:08 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction sorry to bother you again
So Qt on the Kobo with Alpine/Musl went well after jumping through a million hoops. But as you saw above, I can't get any input on the Mini. I switched to my Glo HD to try and see if I'd get any. I'll see that tommorrow.
the scribble project is very nice, but could you send me a little and simple example of maybe a push-button centered that would, when it is pressed, terminate the program? so I can see more how to deal with buttons and checkboxes
I looked a bit at the UMR code, very very interesting. A bit too complicated for me though haha (at least for now)
thanks!


[2/24/2021 6:14 AM] tux_linux
@fermino I'll test your script probably tomorrow after school, I've been quite "off" KoBox these days, now it's time to get back into it a bit!


[2/24/2021 6:43 AM] tux_linux
@dill https://alpinekobox.ddns.net/tux-linux/kobo-kernel/src/branch/master


[2/24/2021 10:57 AM] officeraction.
nice that you could get umr to work. as i said before the input is not right for some devices you can try to adjust the platform plugin parameters and see if that helps:
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo:touchscreen_rotate=90
for example.
For the pushbutton you can just google that. Its just regular qt code.


[2/24/2021 2:02 PM] tux_linux
Ok thx


[2/24/2021 2:04 PM] tux_linux
Also, do you use the Qt UI designer sometimes, or you created the UI in the code?


[2/24/2021 9:23 PM] officeraction.
yea sure the designer is not bad. i use it all the time.


[2/24/2021 10:23 PM] tux_linux
Nice


[2/25/2021 12:49 AM] the.mightydill
do i update modules again, or just dd?


[2/25/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux
modules as well


[2/25/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux
sorry for not putting them in a txz, I forgot


[2/25/2021 12:49 AM] the.mightydill
no problem


[2/25/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
this makes it easier


[2/25/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
it'll take you more time to download them all if you don't do a `git clone` or a complete download of the repo though


[2/25/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
looks like they *are* in a txz

[2/25/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
ahhh


[2/25/2021 12:53 AM] the.mightydill
i thought that was the one that *removed* autoupdate 😂


[2/25/2021 12:53 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/25/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
bit of a problem


[2/25/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
cant dd because of wifi not working


[2/25/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
but


[2/25/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
you can access konsole?

[2/25/2021 1:05 AM] the.mightydill
yea, but what about the modules?


[2/25/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
same thing


[2/25/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
e.g. `mv /mnt/onboard/modules/<some module> /drivers/<platform>/usb/gadget`


[2/25/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
ah i see


[2/25/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
i used ftp the first time


[2/25/2021 1:07 AM] the.mightydill
ill do that and post the results on MobileRead


[2/25/2021 1:07 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[2/25/2021 1:07 AM] tux_linux

you could just also stick the sd card in your computer and put the modules there

@fermino : testing img-tool on a Debian VM, got this error
https://pv.olaiz.net/?afe296cb55ecf9e3#ESfDdgnK9mD6ADJTnHDquCUbUdKkDNDdBENZPtHRMSoc


[2/25/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
will investigate


[2/25/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh, yeah, you need to create the base file


[2/25/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
The zeroed img and then mke2fs


[2/25/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/25/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
and I put it where?


[2/25/2021 4:15 AM] ferminolaiz
And then create all the root folders


[2/25/2021 4:15 AM] ferminolaiz
It goes in base-files


[2/25/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/25/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
so I `cp` the base-layout folder contents to the mounted disk image?


[2/25/2021 4:28 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction it's strange, I can't seem to get any input with the musl compiled UMR, I tried a light maps example too and I did have something print on the framebuffer (great!) but I wasn't able to input anything either.
with the glibc one (stock install package you provide) all works fine though. Should I try with glibc and a Debian chroot? or is there a simpler fix?


[2/25/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
@dill  did you receive my PM?


[2/25/2021 4:56 AM] ferminolaiz
Only the folders, not it's contents


[2/25/2021 4:56 AM] ferminolaiz
Its*


[2/25/2021 4:56 AM] ferminolaiz
And chown them to the user running the imgtool


[2/25/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
but wait, will the minirootfs files get to the img at some point?


[2/25/2021 4:57 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/25/2021 4:57 AM] ferminolaiz
The folders are just a quick workaround for the owner problem


[2/25/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/25/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
but you lost me there
what should I do next?

Make sure that the img is not already mounted


[2/25/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
i'll reboot the vm, should solve some problems


[2/25/2021 5:02 AM] ferminolaiz
Good idea


[2/25/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
also, if we want to build on x86_64, maybe integrating qemu-arm-static would be useful


[2/25/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
and like create a cross-chroot environment


[2/25/2021 5:03 AM] ferminolaiz
That'd be super nice


[2/25/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
pretty simple too
```
# cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static ./chroot-dir/usr/bin
# chroot ./chroot-dir /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /bin/sh
```


[2/25/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux

[2/25/2021 5:24 PM] tux_linux
there should be a nickelmenu entry


[2/25/2021 5:24 PM] tux_linux
(if you installed NickelMenu and KFMon)


[2/25/2021 5:24 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[2/25/2021 5:24 PM] tux_linux
can you launch it then?


[2/25/2021 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
it just restarted nickel...


[2/25/2021 5:25 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/25/2021 5:25 PM] tux_linux
go in Konsole


[2/25/2021 5:25 PM] tux_linux
then


[2/25/2021 5:26 PM] tux_linux
`/mnt/onboard/.adds/inkvt/inkvt.armhf`
what's the output?

still, you could try mounting a squashfs somewhere and accessing files with coolreader, try to read some

[2/25/2021 5:48 PM] the.mightydill
then i put my books in user?


[2/25/2021 5:48 PM] tux_linux
no
you have to squash them first


[2/25/2021 5:48 PM] tux_linux
I included a sample book from gutenberg.org as an example


[2/25/2021 5:52 PM] tux_linux
to squash them

[2/25/2021 6:21 PM] tux_linux
what do you mean by "don't open"?


[2/25/2021 6:21 PM] the.mightydill
files - it says it's starting up on the top, but then "Files" just disappears and it won't open


[2/25/2021 6:22 PM] tux_linux
open terminal


[2/25/2021 6:22 PM] tux_linux
*reinstall ubuntu asap*


[2/25/2021 6:22 PM] tux_linux
but now we'll cope with it


[2/25/2021 6:23 PM] the.mightydill
yeah thats what i thought too


[2/25/2021 6:23 PM] the.mightydill
but i dont want ubuntu, i want arch


[2/25/2021 6:23 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/25/2021 6:23 PM] tux_linux
did you open terminal?


[2/25/2021 6:23 PM] the.mightydill
it's opening


[2/25/2021 6:24 PM] the.mightydill
thats it, terminal wont open, i'm gonna reinstall


[2/25/2021 6:24 PM] the.mightydill
i have a live usb in my pocket


[2/25/2021 6:24 PM] tux_linux
that's handy


[2/25/2021 6:24 PM] the.mightydill
freshly flashed


[2/25/2021 6:25 PM] the.mightydill
yup, i carry it around *just in case*


[2/25/2021 6:25 PM] the.mightydill
so, i delete the ubuntu partition, and then boot from the usb and install again?


[2/25/2021 6:25 PM] tux_linux
hmm no


[2/25/2021 6:25 PM] tux_linux
you boot from the usb first


[2/25/2021 6:26 PM] tux_linux
but to make things simpler, you could actually just use the liveusb as your linux environment
that's what I do all the time


[2/25/2021 6:26 PM] tux_linux
(I customize the livecds of course)


[2/25/2021 6:26 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i'mma do that


[2/25/2021 6:26 PM] the.mightydill
brb, booting from usb


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] tux_linux
but you'll want to save your data on an external drive (or in the internal one) because all changes to the rootfs are backed in RAM


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] the.mightydill
i dont have any data rn


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] the.mightydill
oh i see


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] tux_linux
well, your books
they'll go in the ereader so it's fine


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] the.mightydill
ok, rebooting


[2/25/2021 6:27 PM] tux_linux
nice


[2/25/2021 6:28 PM] the.mightydill
wait, i'll first get etcher on windows then etch the arch iso


[2/25/2021 6:28 PM] tux_linux
alternative


[2/25/2021 6:29 PM] tux_linux
in the ubuntu syslinux splash, press like f2, and then f6, change the end of the bootargs to `\splash toram`


[2/25/2021 6:29 PM] tux_linux
it will copy the squashfs rootfs to RAM, so you'll be able to reflash the liveusb because all will be in ram


[2/25/2021 6:30 PM] the.mightydill
im starting up the other laptop that i use for etching images


[2/25/2021 6:30 PM] tux_linux
oh that's fine too


[2/25/2021 6:34 PM] the.mightydill
i cant find where to download the arch image :\


[2/25/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
archlinux.org


[2/25/2021 6:34 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i know, im on the downloads page, but where's the image?


[2/25/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
choose a mirror


[2/25/2021 6:35 PM] the.mightydill
downloading it


[2/25/2021 6:35 PM] the.mightydill
i went to its.dal.ca


[2/25/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
should be fine


[2/25/2021 6:36 PM] the.mightydill
WAIIIT in the meantime, i managed to launch terminal


[2/25/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[2/25/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
ok and files? does it launch now?


[2/25/2021 6:36 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/25/2021 6:37 PM] tux_linux
well that's good


[2/25/2021 6:37 PM] the.mightydill
yeah apparently all problems are solved :D


[2/25/2021 6:37 PM] tux_linux
nice
so put your books in a folder


[2/25/2021 6:40 PM] the.mightydill
sorry, i was downloading


[2/25/2021 6:44 PM] tux_linux
it's ok


[2/25/2021 6:45 PM] the.mightydill
i accidentally named the folder "lord of the ringas" 😂


[2/25/2021 6:45 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/25/2021 6:45 PM] the.mightydill
ok,  made folder


[2/25/2021 6:46 PM] the.mightydill
now, squash?


[2/25/2021 6:46 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/25/2021 6:47 PM] tux_linux
```mksquashfs lord-of-the-rings lotr.sqsh -b 1048576 -comp gzip -always-use-fragments```


[2/25/2021 6:48 PM] the.mightydill
my folder is called Lord Of The Rings, and it's located in home

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-888F7.png


[2/25/2021 6:48 PM] tux_linux
why a folder with spaces?


[2/25/2021 6:48 PM] tux_linux
rule no.1 in linux: never do that


[2/25/2021 6:48 PM] the.mightydill
k, renaming


[2/25/2021 6:49 PM] the.mightydill
"LOTR"


[2/25/2021 6:49 PM] tux_linux
but in your case it'd be like `mksquashfs /home/Lord\ of\ the\ rings/ lotr.sqsh -b 1048576 -comp gzip -always-use-fragments`


[2/25/2021 6:50 PM] tux_linux
or `mksquashfs "/home/Lord of the rings" lotr.sqsh blablabla`


[2/25/2021 6:50 PM] the.mightydill


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-91D02.png


[2/25/2021 6:50 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/25/2021 6:51 PM] the.mightydill
apparently no such file or directory


[2/25/2021 6:51 PM] the.mightydill
huh


[2/25/2021 6:51 PM] tux_linux
`ls /home` ?


[2/25/2021 6:51 PM] tux_linux
my guess is it would be more like in /home/dill


[2/25/2021 6:51 PM] the.mightydill
bingo

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-5DBCC.png


[2/25/2021 6:52 PM] tux_linux
yep, definitely in /home/dill/LOTR


[2/25/2021 6:52 PM] tux_linux
you've been mislead by Nautilus' "Home" definition


[2/25/2021 6:52 PM] tux_linux
which is not good at all


[2/25/2021 6:52 PM] tux_linux
is it there?


[2/25/2021 6:53 PM] the.mightydill
yep

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-CF7C0.png


[2/25/2021 6:54 PM] tux_linux
so the file should be in /home/dill


[2/25/2021 6:54 PM] tux_linux
or "Home" in files/nautilus


[2/25/2021 6:55 PM] the.mightydill
so if i understand, i put lotr.sqsh into /mnt/onboard of the kobo, then mount it on /mnt/user?

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-BD4A8.png


[2/25/2021 6:55 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/25/2021 6:57 PM] the.mightydill
how do i fix InkVT?


[2/25/2021 6:57 PM] tux_linux
don't know for now


[2/25/2021 6:57 PM] tux_linux
try with konsole


[2/25/2021 6:57 PM] the.mightydill
np


[2/25/2021 7:00 PM] the.mightydill
it works :D


[2/25/2021 7:00 PM] the.mightydill
but pbchess doesnt agree with my eink screen, which is unusual


[2/25/2021 7:00 PM] tux_linux
did it work before now?


[2/25/2021 7:00 PM] tux_linux
did it work after you flashed the new kernel?


[2/25/2021 7:01 PM] the.mightydill
yep, it's usable, but there's a grey bar on the side


[2/25/2021 7:01 PM] the.mightydill
which i can usually get rid of with a sleep and wake


[2/25/2021 7:01 PM] tux_linux
... but now you can't


[2/25/2021 7:01 PM] the.mightydill
do what?


[2/25/2021 7:01 PM] tux_linux
get rid of with sleep/wake


[2/25/2021 7:02 PM] the.mightydill
yea i can


[2/25/2021 7:02 PM] tux_linux
oh well it's fine then


[2/25/2021 7:02 PM] the.mightydill
and its not that much of a problem really


[2/25/2021 7:03 PM] the.mightydill

[2/25/2021 7:04 PM] tux_linux

don't worry i'll be there to help


[2/25/2021 7:05 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[2/25/2021 7:07 PM] the.mightydill
do i plug usb in first, or do i turn off laptop first


[2/25/2021 7:07 PM] tux_linux
doesn't matter


[2/25/2021 7:07 PM] the.mightydill
k rebooting


[2/25/2021 7:07 PM] the.mightydill
🤞


[2/25/2021 7:15 PM] the.mightydill
i've booted on the usb and i have a zsh prompt


[2/25/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
now what


[2/25/2021 7:17 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux half of the things in the install guide are way over my head :\


[2/25/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
ok, i've gone up to the partitioning step


[2/25/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
i've written with fdisk


[2/25/2021 7:33 PM] tux_linux
you didn't mess up the windows partition?


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
i have *no* idea...


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
we'll see


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
i deleted partition 6, kind of stupid of me


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
i'm about to install it


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
on /dev/sda6


[2/25/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux

How to Install Arch Linux in 2020 [Step by Step Guide]
Ready to get your hands dirty with the big boy's Linux distro? Here's a step by step guide to show you how to install Arch Linux.
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/install-arch-linux-featured-7FB79.png


[2/25/2021 7:36 PM] the.mightydill
im following this guide


[2/25/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
well it's fine too


[2/25/2021 7:39 PM] the.mightydill
i think i've done it


[2/25/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
nice


[2/25/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
reboot, moment of truth


[2/25/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
you've installed grub?


[2/25/2021 7:40 PM] the.mightydill
i have to configure first

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-6E8E6.png


[2/25/2021 7:40 PM] the.mightydill
grub?


[2/25/2021 7:40 PM] the.mightydill
how? pacstrap?


[2/25/2021 7:40 PM] tux_linux
yeah, it's after


[2/25/2021 7:40 PM] tux_linux
continue the guide


[2/25/2021 7:44 PM] the.mightydill
after `timedatectl list-timezones`


[2/25/2021 7:45 PM] the.mightydill
it wont let me type commands


[2/25/2021 7:45 PM] tux_linux
?


[2/25/2021 7:45 PM] the.mightydill
`lines (numbers) END`


[2/25/2021 7:45 PM] tux_linux
type `q`


[2/25/2021 7:46 PM] the.mightydill


{Reactions}
👍 

[2/25/2021 7:49 PM] the.mightydill
installing grub


[2/25/2021 7:53 PM] the.mightydill
getting GNOME


[2/25/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux
ok


[2/25/2021 7:53 PM] the.mightydill
man, pacman is useful


[2/25/2021 7:55 PM] the.mightydill
the problem is, i always have to use a wired connection because the wireless adapter on this laptop is broken


[2/25/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
wired is still faster than wifi


[2/25/2021 7:55 PM] the.mightydill
yeh


[2/25/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
you can also buy a wifi to wired adapter


[2/25/2021 7:55 PM] the.mightydill
less convenient though


[2/25/2021 7:56 PM] the.mightydill
and the laptop has a trash battery, so it always has to be plugged in


[2/25/2021 7:56 PM] tux_linux
then using wired isn't a concern


[2/25/2021 8:03 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/25/2021 8:03 PM] the.mightydill
i can't login...


[2/25/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
did you set a password?


[2/25/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
no


[2/25/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
well...


[2/25/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
it didn't say how to set one :\


[2/25/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
that's the pitfalls of using another guide than the official one


[2/25/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/25/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
what now?


[2/25/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
boot into the liveusb, mount the partition at /mnt, arch-chroot /mnt, then passwd


[2/25/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
so basically a reinstall?


[2/25/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/25/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
just remount the partition and chroot, then run the `passwd` command to set a root password


[2/25/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
which one do i boot onto? the install medium?


[2/25/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
liveusb


[2/25/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but i booted off the live usb and its saying "install medium, boot existing os," etc


[2/25/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
install medium


[2/25/2021 8:09 PM] the.mightydill
k


[2/25/2021 8:10 PM] the.mightydill
so:

```
mount /dev/sda6 /mnt 
arch-chroot /mnt
passwd
```?


[2/25/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/25/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
then `exit` and `reboot`


[2/25/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
i did `exit` and `shutdown now`, but no difference i guess


[2/25/2021 8:12 PM] the.mightydill
...idk what my username is ;\


[2/25/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
`root`


[2/25/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
the screen appears to be all grey


[2/25/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
nvm


[2/25/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
?


[2/25/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
how do i create a normal user? this is priveliged


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
or however you spell it


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
`useradd -m -G wheel dill`


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
then `passwd dill`


[2/25/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
then `pacman -S sudo`


[2/25/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
`nano /etc/sudoers`
uncomment the line that starts with %wheel


[2/25/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
WAIIT wifi seems to be working :O


[2/25/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
my dad said it only sometimes works :\


[2/25/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill
i just used settings


[2/25/2021 9:04 PM] ferminolaiz
I made the same mistake the first time I tried to install arch


[2/25/2021 9:04 PM] ferminolaiz
And the second too hahahah


[2/25/2021 9:04 PM] ferminolaiz
IIRC


[2/25/2021 9:04 PM] tux_linux
no me was that I forgot to install dhcpcd


[2/25/2021 9:06 PM] the.mightydill
when i open software, it says "no application data found"


[2/25/2021 9:06 PM] the.mightydill
and, before, windows 10 was on /dev/sda1... but it doesnt show on boot


[2/25/2021 9:06 PM] the.mightydill
nor does it show ubuntu on boot


[2/25/2021 9:06 PM] the.mightydill
i got arch on /dev/sda6 though


[2/25/2021 9:07 PM] the.mightydill
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] tux_linux
Don't use "Software"


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] the.mightydill
use `sudo apt-get`?


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] tux_linux
https://archlinux.org/packages/ is your friend


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] the.mightydill
also, discord seems to crash


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] tux_linux
with `pacman -S`


[2/25/2021 9:09 PM] tux_linux
the app or in the browser?


[2/25/2021 9:10 PM] the.mightydill
browser


[2/25/2021 9:10 PM] tux_linux
what is the one you're using?


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] the.mightydill
...web


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] tux_linux
don't


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] tux_linux
btw real name of it is epiphany


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] the.mightydill
which one, and how do i get it?


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -S chromium-browser` or `pacman -S firefox`


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] tux_linux
also, don't forget to do a `pacman -Syu` regularly


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, i saw "client=epiphany" in google, wondered what that was about


[2/25/2021 9:11 PM] the.mightydill
k


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] the.mightydill
and what of windows/ubuntu?


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] tux_linux
well you probably destroyed ubuntu while installing arch


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] tux_linux
maybe windows too


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] tux_linux
that idk


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] the.mightydill
no, i didnt touch sda1


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] the.mightydill
i installed arch on sda6


[2/25/2021 9:12 PM] tux_linux
can you still mount sda1 ?


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
let me see


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
liveusb?


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] tux_linux
normally, just open terminal


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
`mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`?


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
brb i'll boot arch


[2/25/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
also apparently "i use arch btw" is a meme


[2/25/2021 9:14 PM] tux_linux

*terminal wont open* argh


[2/25/2021 9:20 PM] tux_linux
ctrl alt f2


[2/25/2021 9:21 PM] the.mightydill
nope


[2/25/2021 9:22 PM] the.mightydill
i ended up spamming terminal and ctrl alt f2, but not working


[2/25/2021 9:22 PM] tux_linux
restart


[2/25/2021 9:29 PM] the.mightydill
no :/


[2/25/2021 9:30 PM] the.mightydill
still none


[2/25/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
ctrl alt f3, f1, f4, f5, f6 ?


[2/25/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
f3 worked


[2/25/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
its a bash shell


[2/25/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -S gnome-terminal konsole xterm`


[2/25/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
wait i logged in as root and


[2/25/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
tried to mount sda1, it said ntfs wasnt a known fs type 😕


[2/25/2021 9:34 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -S ntfs-3g`


[2/25/2021 9:34 PM] tux_linux
retry


[2/25/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
fs is "unclean"


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill
do i need to wash my laptop


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
it mounted


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
hahahah


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill
no, metadata kept in windows cache, refused to mount


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill
:p


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
it's windows bloat


[2/25/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
well it didn't erase windows that's great


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] the.mightydill
falling back to read-only because fs is in an unsafe state


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] the.mightydill
yep :D


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] the.mightydill
i dont understand though, it says windows is running rn


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] tux_linux
you shut it down abruptly ?


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] the.mightydill
no


[2/25/2021 9:37 PM] the.mightydill
i used the top right menu


[2/25/2021 9:38 PM] the.mightydill
not a force shutdown


[2/25/2021 9:41 PM] the.mightydill
tried again, now it says:
```
Mount is denied because the NTFS volume is exclusively opened.
```


[2/25/2021 9:41 PM] tux_linux
`umount /mnt`


[2/25/2021 9:42 PM] the.mightydill
same problem


[2/25/2021 9:42 PM] tux_linux
idk


[2/25/2021 9:42 PM] the.mightydill
i'll restart


[2/25/2021 9:43 PM] the.mightydill
`sync && reboot`


[2/25/2021 9:44 PM] the.mightydill
im dumb, should have done `df -h`, right?


[2/25/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
sda1 not showing up


[2/25/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
hm


[2/25/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
i'll be back later


[2/25/2021 10:32 PM] the.mightydill
back


[2/25/2021 10:32 PM] the.mightydill
what do i do now


[2/25/2021 10:32 PM] tux_linux
well do you absolutely need to write to the ntfs partition?


[2/25/2021 10:32 PM] the.mightydill
no


[2/25/2021 10:32 PM] tux_linux
then you can leave it to mount read only


[2/25/2021 10:33 PM] the.mightydill
so read-only mount, then what


[2/25/2021 10:33 PM] tux_linux
you want to run windows?


[2/25/2021 10:33 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[2/25/2021 10:33 PM] the.mightydill
dual


[2/25/2021 10:33 PM] the.mightydill
mostly i'll be using linux but my parents want to keep windows


[2/25/2021 10:34 PM] tux_linux
did you install arch in uefi or bios?


[2/25/2021 10:34 PM] the.mightydill
not a uefi system, i think it was bios

grub-mkconfig can't find windows 10
I have two SSDs in my PC, one with a working Windows 10 on, and the other a fresh install of Antergos.
Booted Antergos up to get grub set up with both installs, but having difficulties there.

[2/25/2021 10:38 PM] ferminolaiz
The mount thing is because fast boot is enabled


[2/25/2021 10:38 PM] ferminolaiz
It works (sort of) like hibernation


[2/25/2021 10:38 PM] tux_linux
oh yeaaaah


[2/25/2021 10:39 PM] tux_linux
that's far back in my head


[2/25/2021 10:39 PM] ferminolaiz
So even if you shut down properly it'll mount it as reado-only


[2/25/2021 10:39 PM] ferminolaiz
Hahahahah


[2/25/2021 10:39 PM] tux_linux
you have to shut down with SHIFT when pressing "Shut down"


[2/25/2021 11:02 PM] the.mightydill
ohhh okay i'll try that


[2/25/2021 11:02 PM] tux_linux
*on windows, the shutdown thing


[2/25/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
no, the mkconfig thing

*PARTuuid*


[2/25/2021 11:12 PM] the.mightydill
okay


[2/25/2021 11:24 PM] the.mightydill
wait, but the UUID looks more like the example given


[2/25/2021 11:25 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux i'm kinda confused


[2/25/2021 11:25 PM] tux_linux
on what


[2/25/2021 11:26 PM] the.mightydill
the UUID of sda1 looks more like the example on the stack exchange


[2/25/2021 11:26 PM] the.mightydill
than the partUUID


[2/25/2021 11:26 PM] tux_linux
well that's what you want right?


[2/25/2021 11:26 PM] the.mightydill
you said part uuid though


[2/25/2021 11:26 PM] tux_linux
ok take the uuid then, see what happens

@OfficerAction maybe you should try other fonts for UMR, I took Inter for my project, and it feels much more modern than FreeSans/DejaVu in UMR
Just a suggestion, your app is already super awesome :)

@tux-linux some apps wont open on arch


[2/26/2021 10:37 PM] the.mightydill
it says theyre loading on the top, but then it disappears and it doesn't load

`sudo pacman -Sy gnome-tweak-tool`

[2/26/2021 11:53 PM] tux_linux
`sudo pacman -S qemu`


[2/26/2021 11:53 PM] tux_linux
and then, you create a virtualdisk


[2/26/2021 11:53 PM] tux_linux
`qemu-img create -f qcow2 image.img 10G`


[2/26/2021 11:53 PM] tux_linux

ye thats why i dont use sudo


[2/26/2021 11:56 PM] tux_linux
well you didn't install `sudo`


[2/26/2021 11:56 PM] tux_linux
you *can* use sudo
don't be always root


[2/26/2021 11:56 PM] the.mightydill
i have to install sudo? `pacman -S sudo`?


[2/26/2021 11:57 PM] the.mightydill
no, Dill is running in gnome, but root is running in console


[2/26/2021 11:57 PM] the.mightydill
console, as in, ctrl + alt + f3


[2/26/2021 11:57 PM] tux_linux
sudo essentially does
```
user $ su root
root # some command here

[2/26/2021 11:57 PM] the.mightydill
i see


[2/26/2021 11:57 PM] tux_linux
and you can be as `root` just by typing `su root` on whatever terminal you're logged in


[2/26/2021 11:58 PM] the.mightydill
installed


[2/26/2021 11:58 PM] tux_linux
install `sudo`
then `nano /etc/sudoers`
uncomment line where it says "%wheel"
logout login


[2/26/2021 11:58 PM] tux_linux
but do that as root for now, or it'll say "dill is not in the sudoers file"


[2/26/2021 11:59 PM] the.mightydill
i did it as dill :\ and it said i wasnt in the sudoers file, this incident will be reported

[2/27/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
huh well


[2/27/2021 12:10 AM] tux_linux
it's a "pirated" windows version, if you don't mind that


[2/27/2021 12:10 AM] tux_linux
so no product key


[2/27/2021 12:10 AM] the.mightydill
ye i definitely realize that


[2/27/2021 12:10 AM] the.mightydill
ok ill try this


[2/27/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
also it's 32-bit, but given the age of your pc, i wouldn't mind that much


[2/27/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
how much ram?


[2/27/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
`free -mh`


[2/27/2021 12:14 AM] tux_linux
also, you could try to append `-vga virtio` to the qemu cmd, you'll have a neat and crisp scaled resolution


[2/27/2021 12:23 AM] tux_linux
@fermino I was thinking, we could do an OOBE for KoBox in Qt


[2/27/2021 12:24 AM] tux_linux
launch it either on "embedded" or windowed mode


[2/27/2021 12:25 AM] tux_linux
even do an "app launcher" which could launch X apps, making it easier for touch and the corners of the screen
it could have a dashboard
wow that'd be nice
what do you think?


[2/27/2021 12:26 AM] ferminolaiz
That'd be great! It is a really good idea


[2/27/2021 12:26 AM] ferminolaiz
It will take time that, to be honest I don't really have much


[2/27/2021 12:26 AM] tux_linux
well i have;)


[2/27/2021 12:27 AM] ferminolaiz
In any case I'm still available for all hosting/deployment/automation stuff that might be necessary


[2/27/2021 12:28 AM] tux_linux
given inkbox and my recent (well hard) introduction to Qt with gazilions of compilation errors, I think I'll progress furthermore with this and be able to provide a cool GUI for kobox, nicer than mate-panel


[2/27/2021 12:28 AM] ferminolaiz
Nice!


[2/27/2021 12:28 AM] tux_linux
then we could launch Xorg apps fullscreen and maybe exit them with a special window/button somewhere


[2/27/2021 12:30 AM] the.mightydill
and while KB is loading, there could be a loading screen


[2/27/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 12:31 AM] the.mightydill
my download speed for tiny7 is slow...


[2/27/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
how slow?


[2/27/2021 12:31 AM] tux_linux
mine is 1.3mb/s so you can't be that much under


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] the.mightydill
15 mins left to download 700 mb


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
here downloading 512M of data takes 30 mins


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] the.mightydill
>_<


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] the.mightydill
yikes :/


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
and when you download the whole windows 10 iso


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
well


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
4.4g


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] tux_linux
you're gonna have a bad time waiting


[2/27/2021 12:32 AM] the.mightydill
...that'd be painful no matter how fast our wifi connections were


[2/27/2021 12:33 AM] tux_linux
yeah
I'm using wired there, it doesn't help really


[2/27/2021 12:33 AM] the.mightydill
wired is necessary here


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] the.mightydill
honestly its convenient because it also had to be plugged in


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
it's probably the server's speed which makes the download slow


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
e.g. you download deepin linux from china


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[2/27/2021 12:34 AM] tux_linux
good ol' 100kb/s downlink


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] the.mightydill
that would be true pain


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
but you should look at it it is really beautiful


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
(even if it has an EULA)


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] the.mightydill
deepin?


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] tux_linux
just loading their homepage will give you a hint of what the download's going to be like


[2/27/2021 12:35 AM] the.mightydill
oooh, like windows, arch, and mac os all rolled into one


[2/27/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
you can download from osdn though


[2/27/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
it's faster

[2/27/2021 12:36 AM] tux_linux
.... and test the iso in QEMU!


[2/27/2021 12:36 AM] the.mightydill
i have a feeling my parents wouldnt let me take the time to install yet another distro


[2/27/2021 12:37 AM] the.mightydill
oh yeah!


[2/27/2021 12:37 AM] tux_linux
or make your own livedvd/usbs like me


[2/27/2021 12:37 AM] tux_linux
wait I'll show you a pic


[2/27/2021 12:38 AM] the.mightydill
lol, i tried a live dvd for ubuntu but the disk got stuck in the computer so live usb forever


[2/27/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
oh


[2/27/2021 12:38 AM] tux_linux
wait a little I need to find them


[2/27/2021 12:38 AM] the.mightydill
k np


[2/27/2021 12:39 AM] the.mightydill
i wonder if theres a tiny 10... im not fond of windows 7


[2/27/2021 12:39 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 12:42 AM] tux_linux

[2/27/2021 12:42 AM] the.mightydill
*that's a lot*


[2/27/2021 12:42 AM] tux_linux
I made them back when I used my Mac


[2/27/2021 12:42 AM] the.mightydill
*nice!!!*


[2/27/2021 12:42 AM] tux_linux
it had a dvd drive


[2/27/2021 12:43 AM] tux_linux
thousands of customized arch linux ones, ubuntu, q4os, popos, kubuntu


[2/27/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
whooooo


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
but for arch, wouldnt you have to setup each time you booted off a cd?


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
customized I said!


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
oh!


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
so everything is there


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
that's amazing


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
wm, X, firefox, chrome, apps


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] tux_linux
custom user name, custom password


[2/27/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
btw, would `pacman -S chrome` work?


[2/27/2021 12:45 AM] the.mightydill
never mind, i answered my own question


[2/27/2021 12:46 AM] tux_linux
It takes a LOT of time to set up, and you want it to be absolutely clean and perfect, because you'll live with the same system for the following months
e.g. archisos are the worst; you have to set up them in a chroot and kde is so finicky that a small clipboard selection won't go in the history, you have to set up the themes, double-check everything, re double-check everything, install and set up all other programs, and ensure that they work correctly


[2/27/2021 12:46 AM] the.mightydill
archisos are the worst, yeah


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] tux_linux
that's about 1 entire day of work, maybe 2 or 3 when I decide to redo it because it isn't clean


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] the.mightydill
dang!


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] tux_linux
well not the worst; but the worst to set up and make


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] tux_linux
and finally you do the mighty salute command
`mksquashfs rootfs/ filesystem.squashfs -b 1048576 -comp xz -Xdict-size 100% -always-use-fragments`


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] the.mightydill
it took me all yesterday morning to install arch, and that was *with* help from you and a setup guide


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] tux_linux
I know it by heart now


[2/27/2021 12:47 AM] the.mightydill
wooo


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
and it's freezed foreever


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
the only command i know by heart is dd


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
and cp


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
and ls


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
(well I hope, don't you?)


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
...yep


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
ls | grep ?


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
no?


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
ls | grep some_filename


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
that's U S E F U L


[2/27/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
also, i got tiny7 downloaded


[2/27/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux
also, hint for you in the future, when you'll try to do `ls -R /` and it won't work
`find / | grep something`


[2/27/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux
well start qemu


[2/27/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
after `-cdrom` i have to include the *full* file location, right


[2/27/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
`qemu-img create -f qcow2 tiny.img 10G`
`qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom tiny7.iso -hda tiny.img -enable-kvm -m 2048 -vga virtio`


[2/27/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
really!


[2/27/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
if you're in the in the folder, you can just put its filename


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
oh im not in it


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] tux_linux
btw it's called *relative* and *absolute* paths


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
i'll cd


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
oh okay


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] tux_linux
`pwd`


[2/27/2021 12:51 AM] tux_linux
that'll give you the current dir you're in


[2/27/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
`Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory
qemu-system-x86_64: failed to initialize kvm: No such file or directory`


[2/27/2021 12:54 AM] tux_linux
`modprobe kvm-intel`


[2/27/2021 12:54 AM] tux_linux
as root


[2/27/2021 12:54 AM] tux_linux
or sudo


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
if it doesn't work well then... the emulation will be slow


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
`modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'kvm_intel': Operation not supported`


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
wait...


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
bad luck :/


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
remove -enable-kvm


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
ye ok nvm


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[2/27/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
but it will be slow
sloooooooooow


[2/27/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
maybe virtualbox could work
but that's a complicated install


[2/27/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i tried with pacman but there was something about the kernel


[2/27/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
i know


[2/27/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
that's why i stopped using virtualbox


[2/27/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
too complicated to setup, and when you get it working they do an update that breaks everything


[2/27/2021 12:57 AM] the.mightydill
`Windows is loading files...`


[2/27/2021 12:57 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 12:58 AM] tux_linux
the reason kvm doesn't work is probably because the cpu is too old


[2/27/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill
good old loading screen from when i was 4 years old


[2/27/2021 12:58 AM] tux_linux
haha


[2/27/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill
yeah it def is old


[2/27/2021 12:59 AM] tux_linux
no me I knew WinXP


[2/27/2021 12:59 AM] the.mightydill
havent ever used it


[2/27/2021 12:59 AM] tux_linux
good ol' blue "Welcome" screen with the cool jingle


[2/27/2021 12:59 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[2/27/2021 12:59 AM] the.mightydill

ah there we go, the login screen!


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
login?


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] the.mightydill
meanwhile my computer sounds like an airplane


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
you mean
you already installed it?


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] the.mightydill
wait...


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
hahaha not unusual


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] the.mightydill
setup is starting


[2/27/2021 1:00 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
still starting, and my computer is lagging


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
you see why installing 8.1 or up would be a pain


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
it's normal


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
it will finish... some day...


[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill

[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
i'm gonna read

[2/27/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
while this is loading


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
me I'm working on inkbox


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
hows it going?


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
trying to figure out how to do something when a checkbox is toggled


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
and to write that to a config file


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
you know


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
hm


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
C++


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
and Qt


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
ah yikes


[2/27/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
never liked the C languages


[2/27/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
two things I didn't know well until yesterday


[2/27/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
no they're great, just the learning curve is hard, so that's why you don't like them


[2/27/2021 1:05 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/27/2021 1:05 AM] the.mightydill
gotta go :/


[2/27/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[2/27/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
oh ok bye


[2/27/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
im back and i have a question


[2/27/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
how do i install different distros in different partitions


[2/27/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
eg arch in sda1, ubuntu in sda2, deepin in sda3, etc


[2/27/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux


[2/27/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
i'd say it's a pretty bad idea


[2/27/2021 4:00 AM] the.mightydill
why?


[2/27/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
I've not had good experience with this before


[2/27/2021 4:00 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
but you could use gparted or fdisk to partition the disks


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
then *manual* install each distro


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
hypothetically:
`dd if=ubuntu.img of=/dev/sda2`?


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
NOO


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
DON'T use dd for things like that


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
fdisk?


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
you know its nickname?


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[2/27/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
`disk destroyer`


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
i know haha


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
but maybe that it'd work
it's just that it's not very recommendable


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
used fdisk for arch


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
well you could use that


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
why not install Gentoo?


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
I'd be there to help


[2/27/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
and I'd do it at the same time


[2/27/2021 4:03 AM] tux_linux
and you'll learn a good bunch of new things about Linux


[2/27/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
i want to try lots of distros in diff partitions


[2/27/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
i have 6 partitions


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
and my dad said i could destroy windows


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
yeepee


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
that'll be fun


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
suggestion


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap, if the grub is properly installed it should work well


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
wipe the hard disk


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
how many space do you have?


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
idk


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
let me see


[2/27/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
yes, and not when you choose "install alongside bla bla bla"
that's the worst thing to do


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] ferminolaiz
Yes


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] ferminolaiz
Totally


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] ferminolaiz
I agree


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
240 gb i think but i really dk


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
brb


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] ferminolaiz
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
yeah also


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] ferminolaiz
30g for each partition should be plenty


[2/27/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 4:07 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd do the following:


[2/27/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
maybe a centralized data partition could be nice


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] ferminolaiz
512M EFI, ___free___, __home__, 20G * _amount_of_distros, 16G SWAP


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] ferminolaiz
Home would be shared data


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
i don't think he has efi


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
his laptop is like 12 years old


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh, right


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
16G swap? that's A LOT


[2/27/2021 4:08 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd leave some free space to install whatever distro he wants after trying


[2/27/2021 4:09 AM] ferminolaiz
(I have that on my pc, haven't really needed it though)


[2/27/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
but @Elektron, please check the amount of ram on your pc


[2/27/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/27/2021 4:09 AM] ferminolaiz
Is probably overkill


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
yes, that's what I thought


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
Hey @tux-linux have you tried zfs?


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
I fear it honestly


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
ext4 is well fineeeee


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahah you are right by doing so


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
BUT


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
After you get accustomed it's actually amazing


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
yeah, it seems nice


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
but I wouldn't want to move my Qt build stack to that type of filesystem


[2/27/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
You could start out with maybe a virtualized freenas instance to get accustomed to the concepts


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
or qemu


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, with FreeNAS I mean the distro


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] ferminolaiz
It's a FreeBSD distro


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
nice


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
I used bsds before


[2/27/2021 4:11 AM] ferminolaiz
(so official zfs)


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
they're... different


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
but very awesome


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] ferminolaiz
But it seems that zfs on linux is actually stable now so I just made a frankenstein in my pc)


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
I also managed to install OpenBSD on my 20year old imac G3, worked well


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
yeah haha


[2/27/2021 4:12 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh boy, that's nice


[2/27/2021 4:13 AM] ferminolaiz
You're going to laugh at this:


[2/27/2021 4:13 AM] ferminolaiz
I have a 220GiB sata ssd and a 240GiB nvme ssd, both are sort of old and I can't actually boot from the nvme so it's pretty useless for the system


[2/27/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
So I made this, 60G in the ssd for /, then the rest of the sata+the nvme in a raid0 array with zfs


[2/27/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
And 16G of swap in the nvme


[2/27/2021 4:15 AM] ferminolaiz
So the plan is to have at least home in the r0 array but I'll try to move some system stuff there and see how bad it breaks hahahah


[2/27/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
good luck


[2/27/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
i'd give this a failure rate of 50/50


[2/27/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
and if you put 16G swap on the nvme ssd someday it will wear out too much and just be unusable


[2/27/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
but well, I hope for you that it will work...!


[2/27/2021 4:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Probably, I haven't seen the system using too much swap anyways, usually <20MB


[2/27/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
you probably have enough ram


[2/27/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
And the best part about zfs is that it'll take advantage of the free ram, and well, compression


[2/27/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
16G too


[2/27/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
Thank you!!


[2/27/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
There you go

[2/27/2021 4:20 AM] ferminolaiz
Woah


[2/27/2021 4:20 AM] ferminolaiz
W o a h


[2/27/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
I can SSH into it


[2/27/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
233mhz cpu


[2/27/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
slower than the kobo


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] ferminolaiz
Wow


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] ferminolaiz
What about RAM?


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
hahaha


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
256M


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
but before it was 32M


[2/27/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
let me tell you it was not a joy to use it


[2/27/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
ha btw I even installed gcc on it


[2/27/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
and I tried to compile Python


[2/27/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/27/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
no efi


[2/27/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
how?


[2/27/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
wait nvm i'll check in settings


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] the.mightydill
3.8 GiB of memory


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] the.mightydill
160 gb total :/


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd say 8G of swap then


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] ferminolaiz
That's still plenty!


[2/27/2021 4:27 AM] the.mightydill
im familiar with swap because my chromebook doesn't have enough ram for me


[2/27/2021 4:28 AM] ferminolaiz
In the console you can do a `free -mh`


[2/27/2021 4:28 AM] the.mightydill
console or terminal?


[2/27/2021 4:28 AM] the.mightydill
never mind same thing


[2/27/2021 4:28 AM] tux_linux
hmm you should read what the terms really mean


[2/27/2021 4:28 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[2/27/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
i have a pdf about linux on my kobo so i also wanted to start on that


[2/27/2021 4:29 AM] tux_linux
nice!


[2/27/2021 4:29 AM] tux_linux
btw I'm planning to write a book


[2/27/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
title:
`What if your brain was running Linux`


[2/27/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
YES


[2/27/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
it'd have dmesg logs, strace, shell logs
and a main human-readable story


[2/27/2021 4:31 AM] tux_linux
seriously if I write it then it'd be a great book
lots of fun


[2/27/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
definitely


[2/27/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
the title alone is awesome


[2/27/2021 4:31 AM] tux_linux

c?


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] tux_linux
@fermino what do you think about the book?


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill
wooo that looks old


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill
20 years old at least?


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] tux_linux
1998


[2/27/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill
dang!


[2/27/2021 4:33 AM] the.mightydill
10 yrs older than me


[2/27/2021 4:33 AM] the.mightydill
just btw, "super" is the Windows key, right?


[2/27/2021 4:33 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/27/2021 4:33 AM] the.mightydill
'kay


[2/27/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
also, i lost my liveusb :(


[2/27/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
already?


[2/27/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
well don't worry; it happens to anyone


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] tux_linux
me it's more like when I loose my sd card adapter (at least once a day)


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
well i *have* had it lying around on my desk but yeah i lose stuff a lot


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] tux_linux
and when I lost microSDs


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
that would be painful to find


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] tux_linux
wait, SCREWS


[2/27/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
can i make a "liveSD?"


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
well


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
maybe


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
or "liveMicroSD"


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
because i cant get any other drives


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
but 1. your pc probably wouldn't let you boot into it
2. it'd be difficult to do


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
the other computer refuses to spit out my CD


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
Netboot


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
OH YEAH


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
PXE


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
iPXE


[2/27/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
netboot!


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
yep that's a cool thing


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
sometimes I have an ipxe server there; sometimes not


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
it's cool to just start off your computer without anything on it, even a drive


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
i want to keep arch


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
do you have another computer lying around?


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
yeh


[2/27/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
like an old crappy w10 pc?


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
no...


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
like a pc?


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
well yeah but its used a lot


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
doesn't matter


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
what do you have in mind?


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
do you have windows on it?


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
http://labalec.fr/erwan/?cat=28


[2/27/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
that's the ONLY thing that ties me to windows right now


[2/27/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
"it just works"


[2/27/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
linux setup is kind of... not easy


[2/27/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
what im thinking is, i could use a command to install each distro


[2/27/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
and netboot, at least for ubuntu because its a piece of cake


[2/27/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
to netboot? no


[2/27/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
how does netboot work?

[2/27/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
basically


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] ferminolaiz
What book?


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
read a little above


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh NVM I just read the msgs


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd read it, TBH


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahahah


[2/27/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
it would certainly be interesting


[2/27/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
yep, it'll be lots of fun to write


[2/27/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
you know


[2/27/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
`Booting Linux on phsyical brain 0x0`


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
when you have insomnia you go `shutdown now`


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
and when you want to forget all


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
`rm -rf /`


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
if i wanted to start now, what would i do?


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
for installation


[2/27/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
download tinypxe


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
`pacman -S tinypxe`?


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
the link I shared with you


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
install it on windows


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
on your other pc


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
K


[2/27/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
then


[2/27/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
are you sure you don't have your usb somewhere? because it's a lot of hassle to set up all of that


[2/27/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
i'll go look around again


[2/27/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
be back in about 3 mins


[2/27/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
ok


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
no luck :/


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
i *could* try and make the other laptop spit out my DVD


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
imma do that


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
yup


[2/27/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
there could be a hole when you could put a paperclip


[2/27/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
and it'd spit out right there


[2/27/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
the paper clip worked :D


[2/27/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
so just the matter of flashing images


[2/27/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
right?


[2/27/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
nice


[2/27/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
yes
you could transplant the hard drive on the other computer


[2/27/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
why?


[2/27/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
well you want to install via dvd?


[2/27/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
or your pc already has a dvd drive?


[2/27/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
i have a dvd now


[2/27/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
yes i want to install with dvd


[2/27/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
both computers have a dvd slot


[2/27/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
well burn the iso on the dvd


[2/27/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
👍


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
you can do that with `cdrecord` or `k3b` on linux


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
neat


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
`k3b` always worked very well with me


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
well im on windows with the other one rn


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
so im using etcher


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
huh no


[2/27/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
right click -> burn disc image


[2/27/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
is there a difference between burn and flash? just btw


[2/27/2021 4:59 AM] tux_linux
OF COURSE


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] the.mightydill
dang


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] the.mightydill
i want to flash it though


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
well no


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
it won't work


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] the.mightydill
...i used etcher for ubuntu and it worked?

How CD Burners Work
With the rise of the MP3 format, burning your own music CDs has never been so popular -- or so easy. CDs have become one of the most widely adopted data-storage mechanisms.
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/cd-burner-intro-16BDD.jpg


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
etcher is for usb


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[2/27/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
read this and you'll understand why it's not the same at all


[2/27/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
it's for cds, but basically it's the same thing


[2/27/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
is burning permanent though? that's what i want to know


[2/27/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
yes


[2/27/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
unless you use a rw dvd


[2/27/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
well is the dvd blank right now?


[2/27/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
i think so


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
its a dvd-r


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
well does it have anything inside?


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
no


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
*but* i only have the one dvd


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
when you put in the reader, it says "You've inserted a blank disk" or something like that?


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
"New Volume (D:)"


[2/27/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
nothing in file explorer though


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
it should be ok


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
choose your distro


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
"This folder is empty."


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
gentoo ?


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
ubuntu first


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
oh no


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
it's already written up then


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
...damn


[2/27/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
so i cant use it?


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
pretty sure we have a lot of disks downstairs


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
well
maybe it's just windows that is creating a folder so you can burn files to disc but hasn't burned them yet


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
so it *could* work


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
try burning ubuntu, we'll see


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
k


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
just right click on the iso and click burn


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
and wait patiently


[2/27/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
could take ~30mins


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
wait no it says "DVD R drive (E:)" but it doesnt show up in file explorer


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
only in the img burner


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
does that mean its blank


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
should be good


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
k


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
can you click burn?


[2/27/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
"theres no disk in ur burner"


[2/27/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
im gonna go check downstairs for any more


[2/27/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
:/


[2/27/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
nope


[2/27/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
sad


[2/27/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
hunt around for usbs in your house then


[2/27/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
my dad says he threw the DVDs away


[2/27/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
*maybe*


[2/27/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
i only had the one usb


[2/27/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
because the rest are my dad's for work


[2/27/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
or hunt around the room you lost it in


[2/27/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
done :(


[2/27/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
you could try `debootstrap`


[2/27/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap


[2/27/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
or my original suggestion: dd


[2/27/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
*or* the other things you used


[2/27/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
because i agree, dd would ***not*** be safe


[2/27/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
lets see if nautilus recognizes my dvd


[2/27/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
nope


[2/27/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
k gotta go, i'll try netboot in the morning unless i miraculously find a drive


[2/27/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[2/27/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
ok bye


[2/27/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
I might not be there though


[2/27/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
I'm gonna be away for a few days


[2/27/2021 3:52 PM] the.mightydill

[2/27/2021 3:53 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/27/2021 3:53 PM] tux_linux
but not for a long time


[2/27/2021 3:53 PM] the.mightydill
sure no problem


[2/27/2021 3:53 PM] the.mightydill

Linux’s GRUB2 boot loader can boot Linux ISO files directly from your hard drive. Boot Linux live CDs or even install Linux on another hard drive partition without burning it to disc or booting from a USB drive.

[2/27/2021 3:55 PM] tux_linux
it's not stable though and could not work


[2/27/2021 3:55 PM] the.mightydill
no harm in trying though


[2/27/2021 3:55 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 3:55 PM] the.mightydill
i mean there is


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
but I won't be there to help


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
maybe fermino could if he gets online


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] the.mightydill
well then... i'll have to use the guide ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
yep


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] tux_linux
good luck!


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] the.mightydill
thanks


[2/27/2021 3:56 PM] the.mightydill
do you use fedora


[2/27/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/27/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
I never really tried it


[2/27/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
well I mean, I booted it at some point


[2/27/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
but arch and debian based distros are fine enough for me

[2/27/2021 5:36 PM] the.mightydill
found my USB drive :DDD


[2/27/2021 10:24 PM] the.mightydill
what fs type do i use and how big?


[2/27/2021 10:24 PM] the.mightydill
@fermino can you please give me some pointers?


[2/27/2021 10:25 PM] ferminolaiz
What do you want it for?


[2/27/2021 10:27 PM] the.mightydill
ubuntu 20.10


[2/27/2021 10:27 PM] the.mightydill
/dev/sda5


[2/27/2021 10:27 PM] ferminolaiz
For the whole system?


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] the.mightydill
no, just ubuntu on one partition


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] the.mightydill
out of 6 partitions


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
Oh


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
Well


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
I'd say 25G, ext4


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] the.mightydill
thanks


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] the.mightydill
format or no?


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
And make sure to have a swap partition too


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] ferminolaiz
Format it


[2/27/2021 10:28 PM] the.mightydill
how do i do that? (swap)


[2/27/2021 10:29 PM] ferminolaiz
Are you using the installer?


[2/27/2021 10:29 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[2/27/2021 10:29 PM] ferminolaiz
Just create a partition, 8G and select the type as swap


[2/27/2021 10:29 PM] the.mightydill
k, thanks!


[2/27/2021 10:30 PM] the.mightydill
mount point?


[2/27/2021 10:30 PM] the.mightydill
im guessing `/mnt`


[2/27/2021 10:34 PM] ferminolaiz
Nope


[2/27/2021 10:34 PM] ferminolaiz
For the main partition it would be /


[2/27/2021 10:34 PM] ferminolaiz
The swap shouldn't have any


[2/27/2021 10:35 PM] the.mightydill
k, thanks!


[2/27/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
its not letting me go above 539 MB


[2/27/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
@fermino?


[2/27/2021 11:58 PM] ferminolaiz
Which one?


[2/27/2021 11:58 PM] the.mightydill
ubuntu


[2/27/2021 11:59 PM] the.mightydill
both swap and ext4


[2/28/2021 12:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Hum.. that's weird, is the disk empty before you try to create one?


[2/28/2021 12:07 AM] ferminolaiz
Can you maybe take a picture


[2/28/2021 1:26 AM] the.mightydill
you mean i should wipe the disk?


[2/28/2021 1:30 AM] the.mightydill
what im doing is changing the partition to ext4 and resizing it


[2/28/2021 1:48 AM] the.mightydill
gave up on ubuntu and started deepin


[2/28/2021 1:54 AM] the.mightydill
flashing


[2/28/2021 2:34 AM] ferminolaiz
It should let you resize it as long as you have enough space free, if not, you should shrink other partitions to make some space


[2/28/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill
i decided i'm gonna resize the partitions with `fdisk` before i installed, what do you think?


[2/28/2021 3:43 AM] the.mightydill
i resized sda2 and planning to install deepin


[2/28/2021 2:42 PM] tux_linux
Should be OK


[2/28/2021 5:47 PM] the.mightydill
i decided to wipe my disk and create new partitions with `parted`


[2/28/2021 9:39 PM] tux_linux
Good idea


[3/2/2021 12:28 AM] the.mightydill
`fdisk` i'm more comfortable with


[3/2/2021 12:29 AM] the.mightydill
ubuntu is only in emergency mode, any help?


[3/2/2021 12:29 AM] the.mightydill
also can i use the same root partition for different distros


[3/2/2021 12:44 AM] the.mightydill
@fermino


[3/2/2021 1:24 AM] the.mightydill
nvm


[3/2/2021 3:32 AM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction  here's my project currently. I'm stuck there for now because I only have LTE and only 250mb of data here. I made some progress setting config options and making them persistent, launching apps, functions, etc.
Now I'll try to make an Epub reader but it won't be easy. In the code, I started with *something" but it's very bad and I hope that we'll get QtWebKit running on it, and then epub.js with node and we'd have a working Epub reader
Anyways, I included the code and the binaries, you'll want to put them in /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox

Btw for the book, should the brain run with systemd, openrc or sysvinit?


[3/2/2021 3:51 PM] the.mightydill
systemd i think


[3/2/2021 3:51 PM] the.mightydill
btw, deepin and arch installs successful!


[3/2/2021 3:51 PM] the.mightydill
:D


[3/2/2021 3:52 PM] the.mightydill
grub also has a nice little aurora wallpaper


[3/2/2021 4:23 PM] tux_linux
nice!


[3/2/2021 6:07 PM] officeraction.
Hey there. Writing the reader from scratch is quite the task 😄 Just look at koreader or plato, they are massive. It's not impossible tho ;). The other way way is easier. And node runs quite well on the kobo.


[3/2/2021 6:41 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, any pointers to just get it (WebKit) built for the Kobo? I tried removing the flag disabling it and it said that I didn't have the required libc version

👍 

[3/3/2021 8:59 PM] officeraction.
For WebKit I think it's just like WebEngine(chrome), it needs a recent glibc witch in turn needs a more recent kernel than on the kobo (>=3.2 i think). No chance to get it running.


[3/3/2021 9:00 PM] officeraction.
Another libc like musl is the only way


[3/3/2021 9:01 PM] officeraction.
Or if you have a newer kernel on the kobo that should also work


[3/3/2021 10:08 PM] tux_linux
Well
New kernels on mark 7s don't help
But maybe it's the libc which causes all of those problems
Maybe a Debian chroot with glibc?


[3/4/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
How about a first pre-alpha release?

[3/4/2021 11:45 PM] the.mightydill
btw, you're back?


[3/4/2021 11:45 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/4/2021 11:46 PM] the.mightydill
cool


[3/4/2021 11:46 PM] the.mightydill
so, only txt for now? i'm *assuming* it has something to do with `cat`


[3/4/2021 11:46 PM] tux_linux
I could create a git repo tonight, but I want to do some more coding with a text select function that would search dictionnaries


[3/4/2021 11:46 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/4/2021 11:46 PM] tux_linux
and it's ... well, trash


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
by what standards?


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
like, not good for anything beyond displaying text


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
like forget pre-formatted centered text


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
"Huckleberry Finn"?


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/4/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
sometimes the text just clips and goes out of the display


[3/4/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
no not something with `cat`


[3/4/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
yikes :/


[3/4/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
it's a ... compilcated ... mess ... of qlabel + qfile + python + qdiriterator


[3/4/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/4/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
also when i try to install browsers on deepin, it says "broken dependencies"


[3/4/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
plus, discord gives me an update message, but the tar.gz is "corrupted" or something and the .deb is "broken dependencies" again


[3/4/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux
that'll give you an idea of how trash the thing is (but should be fixable in the future though)
```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os

os.chdir("/inkbox/book/split")
book = open("../book.txt", "r")
text = book.read()
book.close()

booklist = text.split(" ")
split_booklist = [booklist[x:x+225] for x in range(0, len(booklist),225)]
len_split_booklist = len(split_booklist)

i = 0

while i < len_split_booklist:
    print(i)
    istr = str(i)
    file_iterator = open(istr, "w")
    writecontent = " ".join(split_booklist[i])
    # writecontent = writecontent.replace("\n", " ")
        i += 1
```


[3/4/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux
in those cases i reinstall the distro AND i do a `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
im using the app store thingy, maybe thats why


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] tux_linux
don't


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
`apt-get`?


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] tux_linux
`apt` is the way


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
k, i'll go ahead and boot deepin


[3/4/2021 11:51 PM] tux_linux
to search the pkg you want, google
`ubuntu <pkg>`


[3/4/2021 11:52 PM] tux_linux
and you'll likely get the name of the pkg that you'll be able to install with `apt install <pkg>`


[3/4/2021 11:52 PM] the.mightydill
k

it wont work but i'll live


[3/5/2021 12:00 AM] the.mightydill
i have discord on arch anyways and i got chromium


[3/5/2021 12:00 AM] the.mightydill
which distro should i install next?


[3/5/2021 12:00 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux


[3/5/2021 12:00 AM] tux_linux
i suggest you try gentoo


[3/5/2021 12:01 AM] the.mightydill
i have the gentoo img on my usb rn actually


[3/5/2021 12:01 AM] the.mightydill
no idea how to install though


[3/5/2021 12:01 AM] tux_linux
if you're brave enough, linux from scratch

[3/5/2021 12:02 AM] the.mightydill
wait nvm i forgot, i reinstalled arch a couple days ago


[3/5/2021 12:02 AM] the.mightydill
thx


[3/5/2021 12:03 AM] the.mightydill
also, how do i create a swap partition with `fdisk`


[3/5/2021 12:03 AM] the.mightydill
or


[3/5/2021 12:03 AM] the.mightydill
any other command

[3/5/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
there you go


[3/5/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
i foolishly made my deepin 83G so no swap space :/


[3/5/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
how can i resize?


[3/5/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
`resize2fs /dev/sda3 33G`?


[3/5/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux


[3/5/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
i guess


[3/5/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
i don't use `resize2fs` very often


[3/5/2021 12:13 AM] the.mightydill
```[dill@archlinux ~]$ sudo resize2fs /dev/sda3 33G
[sudo] password for root: 
resize2fs 1.46.1 (9-Feb-2021)
Filesystem at /dev/sda3 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
resize2fs: On-line shrinking not supported
[dill@archlinux ~]$ ```


[3/5/2021 12:13 AM] the.mightydill
so i'll use usb


[3/5/2021 12:13 AM] the.mightydill
see you in 2 mins


[3/5/2021 12:13 AM] tux_linux
start on a live cd


[3/5/2021 12:13 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/5/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
done


[3/5/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
i'll leave now


[3/5/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/5/2021 12:20 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/5/2021 12:20 AM] tux_linux
bye


[3/5/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
***ready to install gentoo!***


[3/5/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
will let you know how that goes :D


[3/5/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[3/5/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
feel free to ask for help


[3/5/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
so apparently the `resize2fs` didnt work >:C


[3/5/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
i wanted to resize 83G to a 33G then make another 33 partition, then use the remaining space for swap


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
well... maybe you could try erasing the hard drive and starting all over again but by installing Gentoo
I think it will be more easy as you'll be able to stay with the stock guide and not modify that much the instructions
but if you don't want to... what's the "remaining space" ?


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
i think 17G


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
that's ... a lot


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
well so much that the kernel couldn't actually use it all


[3/5/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
i think i should make a 10G partition then


[3/5/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
how many ram?


[3/5/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
dk


[3/5/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
`free -mh` ?


[3/5/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
```               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.8Gi       902Mi       2.1Gi       191Mi       794Mi       2.5Gi
Swap:             0B          0B          0B
```


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
ok so 4G


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
yeh


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
not that bad


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
you'll *need* swap for gentoo though


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
i'd say that 8G would be enough


[3/5/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
then 9g freespace?


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
you create a swap partition


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
then you activate it with `swapon`


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
it's all in the gentoo guide


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but after that there'd still be freespace of 9g


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
after you created the swap partition?


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/5/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
then increase the size of the previous partition to fill all the disk


[3/5/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/5/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
but the thing is i dont want to erase the disk again


[3/5/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
i want to install gentoo on sda2


[3/5/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
its empty


[3/5/2021 4:47 AM] tux_linux
`fdisk -l` please, will help me visualize what partition layout you have


[3/5/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill

[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
do you use all the partitions?


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
`/dev/sda3       138414080 312581807 174167728  83G 83 Linux` is the issue, i want it to be reduced to 33G


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
only 1 and 3


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
what system are you on?


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
arch atm


[3/5/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
try with `gparted`, even if it's GUI i've had some luck with that in the past


[3/5/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
if it doesn't work, start the gentoo live cd and to the resize2fs thing from there


[3/5/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
`sudo: gparted: command not found`


[3/5/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
well; install it


[3/5/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
installing


[3/5/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
"free space following (MiB)"


[3/5/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
hmm


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
9000000


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
no wait


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
MiB not MB i think...


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
9216


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
no mib and mb are similar


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
my head thought that it was asking you kibs


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
except mib are ^2 and mb are ^10


[3/5/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
you'll learn to live with them as you use linux


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
they're everywhere


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
especially in KDE


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
"Minimum size: 85043 MiB"


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
and in pretty much all shell commands that give you space info


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
same for maximum


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
oh that's bad


[3/5/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
is the partition unmounted?


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
i think


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
i really dont know


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
`df -h`?


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
well if it's unmounted it won't show up


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
(in df)


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
restart and boot gentoo, do the resizing stuff from there, should work


[3/5/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/5/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
with parted or gparted or resize2fs?


[3/5/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
well resize2fs


[3/5/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/5/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
the livecd has no gui


[3/5/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
rebooting on usb


[3/5/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
the *fs* is 33g but not the *partition*


[3/5/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
you mean, installed size?


[3/5/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/5/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
that's impossible then


[3/5/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
the partition is bigger than the filesystem apparently


[3/5/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
*apparently*


[3/5/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
then you have another partition


[3/5/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
no?


[3/5/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
where did you get that from?


[3/5/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
"the filesystem is already <number> blocks long, nothing to do"


[3/5/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
/dev/sda1 is 33, same with sda2, and sda3, which has arch, is 83g


[3/5/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
try with `-f`


[3/5/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
`resize2fs -f /dev/sda3 33G`?

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/5/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
after `e2fsck`


[3/5/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/5/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
same thing


[3/5/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
already 8650752 blocks long or something...


[3/5/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
don't know then


[3/5/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
can't really give you another advice than starting from scratch again


[3/5/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/5/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
i'll put this on hold until the weekend


[3/5/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
because i have a lot to do


[3/5/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/5/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
btw, would you be willing to lend a hand to test inkbox? like, in the next days, probably?


[3/5/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
sure!


[3/5/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
ok thx


[3/5/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
np


[3/5/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
you'll have to test it on the aura, because touch input is broken on the mini


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
so i think i'll go look up solutions and if i dont find one then i'll do the wipe


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
wait, instead of a full wipe, i could delete sda3 only


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
yes!


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
and make some new ones


[3/5/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
can i use logical partitions?


[3/5/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
logical is 4 max, right?


[3/5/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
you should be able to


[3/5/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
4 max primary, then logical


[3/5/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
wait, isn't it called "Extended"?


[3/5/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
but yeah take primary whenever possible


[3/5/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
yea ok


[3/5/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
primary is up to sda4 is seems


[3/5/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
k then what i'll do is:


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
delete sda3 from deepin, use `fdisk` to create some new partitions and some swap space


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
then reinstall arch and gentoo


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
but you should wait for the swap


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
do it when you install gentoo


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
so install arch first, then make swap?


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
with gentoo


[3/5/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
yeah, it could be better to skip the part where the Arch guide says that you need to have swap


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
but dont i need the swap for gentoo installation?


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
you set up it while installing


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
before compiling and all


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
i.e. before your computer explodes


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
makes sense


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/5/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
yeah, actually


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
>_>


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
i had one computer that the thermal paste was so bad that it shut down randomly when doing high CPU tasks


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
so I thought


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
why not install gentoo on it?


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/5/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
I opened the computer, put a fan underneath it and put it between two chairs


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
there you go, super cooling and the computer did not shut down for three days in a row of compiling


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
did it work?


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
well yes


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
woot


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
but gnome failed because of low ram


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
no swap?


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
but the system installed though, it worked


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
yes, i think


[3/5/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
there was swap?


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
huh


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
yes but sometimes swap is not enough


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
sometimes you *really* need ram


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
I also installed Gentoo on a 20 year old thin client


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
the kernel took 2 DAYS to compile with the modules


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
yeah, like 48 hours


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
thats true when im listening to spotify, chatting, and playing a high graphics game on my chromebook


[3/5/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
YIKES


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
this is 11 years old, its probably gonna take like 8 hours


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
certainly not


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
i'd say at least 4 days


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
yeeeeek


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
or 1 or 2 weeks if you intend to compile the whole gnome desktop and chrome


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
AH


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
but you'll be proud


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
`I use Gentoo btw`


[3/5/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
lool


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
😤


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
hahaha


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
you can join the Gentoo reddit too in the meantime


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
r/gentoo?


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
yep


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
im in the gentoo disc as well


[3/5/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
thats gonna be painful to install then haha


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
i'll start early saturday morning


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
After that, just to hurt you more, I'll make you install Linux From Scratch
looool


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
ahhhh


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
no just a joke, don't worry


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
lol it'd be nice to try tho


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
but linux from scratch really took me 1 week or so


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
it was really cool though


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
and that's what got me back in mobileread and kobo hacking


[3/5/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
around the ~1st of january


[3/5/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
woo


[3/5/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
yeah, felt good to come back after all of these months


[3/5/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
linux from scratch - is that a distro?


[3/5/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/5/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
i was surprised to see you come back onto MR


[3/5/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
with such a big project


[3/5/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
i was excited

:D


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
yeah, the development environment I actually found that in late August, but I didn't know I could mount imgs with a 2G filesystem and I was stuck with a 256Mb tmpfs due to fat32 limitations


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
i have to go :/


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
school tomorrow and all that


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/5/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
bye


[3/5/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
morning


[3/5/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
so...


[3/5/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
for the compilation of the kernel


[3/5/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
will the laptop be on for 2-3 weeks, and if so, will it use wifi? @tux-linux


[3/5/2021 3:41 PM] the.mightydill
gotta go


[3/5/2021 3:41 PM] the.mightydill
see you at like 8 or 9pm MST


[3/5/2021 4:16 PM] tux_linux
no, well only to download the source files


[3/5/2021 4:16 PM] tux_linux
I suggest you hook it up to wired internet though


[3/5/2021 4:16 PM] tux_linux
*strongly suggest*


[3/5/2021 4:34 PM] tux_linux
Ok, so finally added a dictionary to InkBox

[3/5/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
@OfficerAction do you know of a way to increase the font size (especially of the reader's qlabel) ? I tried multiple ways (setPointSize, setPixelSize) but none of them worked. The text is still scaled to the screen and there's no way to change its size.
Maybe you have a hint? or is it impossible?
thanks!


[3/6/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
wow!


[3/6/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
i can test if you want btw


[3/6/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
now?


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
anytime


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
do you already have UMR installed?


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
i don't read manga


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
should i install it?


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
me neither


[3/6/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
not necessarily


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
I'll make an archive with all the files


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
how long do you think you'll be there?


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
koboroot?


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
hmm i can be back on in 30 mins


[3/6/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
dinner in a bit, also preparing to reinstall arch


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
no not koboroot


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
a bit like one click packages


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
oh so a script


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
just a txz that you untar in "Kobo eReader'


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
oh wait, so like a .adds folder?


[3/6/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
oh okay


[3/6/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
yeah, basically the one click script does that; it extracts the zip in the kobo partition


[3/6/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
dinner brb

[3/6/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
you'll need the stuff with python3 `update-kobostuff python3` if not already done


[3/6/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
extract it in the Kobo eReader partition


[3/6/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
(/dev/mmcblk0p3) - > the exported one


[3/6/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/6/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
I'm thinking of merging InkBox with KoBox
like, we could have a launcher, and InkBox would be easily accessible, but we could also have Xorg apps with that


[3/6/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
oh yeah!


[3/6/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
or make inkbox a kobox app


[3/6/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
well


[3/6/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
technically qt in xorg is possible, and it's used by some apps like telegram


[3/6/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
but it will be better if we just display it raw to the framebuffer


[3/6/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
also, you'll probably want to start the thing via ssh


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
no ssh


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
kernel


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
aura


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
the script is in /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/inkbox.sh


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
you *start if from there*, not from some other folder


[3/6/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
or things will go wrong


[3/6/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
like
`cd /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox` and then `./inkbox.sh`


[3/6/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
you'll probably want to tweak some settings in the inkbox launch command in the script, as touch input might not work right away, though you should be good, it's not like with the kobox thing


[3/6/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
there
```
ADDSPATH=/mnt/onboard/.adds/ QTPATH=${ADDSPATH}/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QTPATH}lib:lib:QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo:touchscreen_rotate=270:touchscreen_invert_x=1:touchscreen_invert_y=1:logicaldpitarget=0 ./inkbox
```


[3/6/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
also, for the brightness to work... ah we'll discuss that once you have it installed, it's not crucial


[3/6/2021 4:28 AM] tux_linux
@dill did you get it running?


[3/6/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
`echo 100 > /sys/devices/backlight/mxc_msp430.0`


[3/6/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
yeah, change the `ln -s` in the script accordignly


[3/6/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
no idea where my e-reader is atm


[3/6/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
:/


[3/6/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/6/2021 5:08 AM] the.mightydill
found it


[3/6/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
great


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
i left it in the car :/


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
is it still ok?


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
a little slow refresh


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
normal


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
should go away in a couple hours


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
or faster if it warms up faster


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
well, you can test it now!


[3/6/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/6/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/6/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
downloading the tar.gz


[3/6/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
for gentoo, do i have to leave it on the *entire* time its compiling


[3/6/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
sure


[3/6/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
*have* to?


[3/6/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
well... yes, otherwise how would it be able to compile things?


[3/6/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
true


[3/6/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
so it'll be lying around, on, for a couple weeks


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
well it depends what you want to do with gentoo


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
same as arch


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
if you decide to compile the whole gnome desktop, yea, sure


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
if it's only for CLI, then i'd say 3-4 days


[3/6/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
nope, gnome


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
wishing you luck

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
whats the gui that uses the least time


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
openbox


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
openbox + xorg


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
that's what kobox uses


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
thats what i was about to say lol


[3/6/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
you can customize it pretty much how you want


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
check out bunsenlabs, they have a good distro with a pretty good design


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
you think gnome would work on kobox


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
NOOOOO


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
like


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
don't


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
ever


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
think of it


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
if it ran; well it'd crash right away


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/6/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
i see


[3/6/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
1. low ram
2. crappy graphics
3. crappy cpu
4. crappy chroot environment


[3/6/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/6/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
did the inkbox tgz finish downloading?


[3/6/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
i finished extracting, actually


[3/6/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
nice


[3/6/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
```Installing Python3 r18219 . . .```


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
should i go `python-setup`


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
if you can, and if it works, please take a picture of inkbox running, it'll be cool


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
if you want


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
ok sure


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
should i go `python-setup` though?


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
well it's up to you


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
it's just 2 minutes approx


[3/6/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
took near 15 for my mini though


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
look on the screen this time for progress 😉


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
the mini has a slower cpu and less ram


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
WHAT


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
already done


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
what did I say


[3/6/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
ok so now `cd /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox`


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
then what


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
`./inkbox.sh`


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
YEEEEE


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
working!


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
well, touch input?


[3/6/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
perfect!


[3/6/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
oh that's actually awesome


[3/6/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
:D


[3/6/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
do you see the authors quote


[3/6/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, thats a cool part!


[3/6/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
what about the general design? look-n-feel? font?


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
btw there's no calendar app for now


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
others should work though


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
"search: does nothing


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
normal


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
i didn't figure out how to integrate qvirtualkeyboard in this mess of code


[3/6/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
like, reader.cpp has 500 lines of code


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
maybe look at the source code for vlasovsoft


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
well


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
the launcher


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
there's none


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
it's closed-source


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
cant you look at the files in your e-reader though


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
oh actually


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
it might be open source


[3/6/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
just to get a sense of how its made


[3/6/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
well I have the sense of how it's made
umr did integrate it too; i'll have a look at that


[3/6/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
do you have a txt file to test reading?


[3/6/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
not atm


[3/6/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/76


[3/6/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
download the plain-text (utf-8) one


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
and then click on reader and choose the file (it automatically sets the directory to onboard)


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
i hit the quit button and it froze


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
well


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
"Quit"


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
what would you expect it to do instead?


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
it exited, simply


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
so how do i go back to nickel?


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
ohh ok


[3/6/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
reboot


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
but you can access the shell


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
i thought my ereader crashed


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
just relaunch inkbox.sh


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
first im going back to nickel to put the txt file on it


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
well


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
scp


[3/6/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
ftp


[3/6/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
didnt think of that actually :/


[3/6/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
Important note: when you launch it via inkbox.sh and want to stop it with ctrl c, if you launched settings, or the saved words app, it silently "exits" inkbox and restarts it when you click the back or ok button, to reload settings and all.
therefore, you'll want to do a `killall inkbox` before re-launching it if you didn't quit it with the "Quit" button


[3/6/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/6/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
but if you did quit with the button, there's nothing to worry about


[3/6/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
we could make a nm action for inkbox.sh


[3/6/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/6/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
but it's not ready


[3/6/2021 5:31 AM] tux_linux
like, the render engine is crap


[3/6/2021 5:31 AM] the.mightydill
```[root@snow root]# cd /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox
[root@snow inkbox]# ./inkbox.sh
rm: can't remove '/var/run/brightness': No such file or directory
```


[3/6/2021 5:31 AM] tux_linux
not to worry about


[3/6/2021 5:31 AM] tux_linux
you just rebooted


[3/6/2021 5:31 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 5:32 AM] tux_linux
so it didn't create the symlink in the tmpfs /var/run before the script


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
reading!


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
how do i get the prompt


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
also hints so that inkbox loves you and you love inkbox, don't try to bring up the options menu when there's a lot of text in the page (like it goes from top to bottom) or it will clip and things will go... strange. like, qt will enlarge the display


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
the words?


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
```

[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
no prompt


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
well no


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
like `[root@snow root]#`


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
inkbox is running


[3/6/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/6/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
but to test the dictionnary


[3/6/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
*dictionary


[3/6/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
double-tap on a word


[3/6/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
and it should show up very quickly

retry

brb


[3/6/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
but why do you want a shell


[3/6/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
brightness


[3/6/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
oh


[3/6/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
well set that in the inkbox.sh


[3/6/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
`echo some_brightness_value > /some/brightness/backlight/folder/brightness`


[3/6/2021 5:36 AM] tux_linux
or you can just set it before launching inkbox.sh


[3/6/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
it'll remember and won't flush out the lights


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] the.mightydill
whats the path for your libra brightness


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] the.mightydill
because its the same for my aura


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] tux_linux
it's the one that's in the script


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] tux_linux
possible


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] tux_linux
well it should work with the options brightness setting in the reader then


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] the.mightydill
theres an option?


[3/6/2021 5:40 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/6/2021 5:41 AM] the.mightydill
ok wait i'll make an nm action for myself


[3/6/2021 5:41 AM] tux_linux
the options button in the bottom, between next and previous


[3/6/2021 5:42 AM] the.mightydill
crashed when i tried creating a shell before


[3/6/2021 5:43 AM] tux_linux
what do you mean


[3/6/2021 5:43 AM] the.mightydill
i tried a new ssh session, pressed next, and it froze


[3/6/2021 5:43 AM] tux_linux
don't know


[3/6/2021 5:43 AM] the.mightydill
so im just making a nm option


[3/6/2021 5:44 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/6/2021 5:44 AM] tux_linux
it should remember the brightness level once it's set


[3/6/2021 5:44 AM] tux_linux
(inkbox)


[3/6/2021 5:45 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/6/2021 5:47 AM] tux_linux
you're probably the first person in the world who tests it (apart from me), so that's nice


[3/6/2021 5:47 AM] the.mightydill
`menu_item:main:InkBox:cmd_spawn:'cd /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox && ./inkbox.sh'`


[3/6/2021 5:47 AM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/6/2021 5:47 AM] tux_linux
yeah that seems good


[3/6/2021 5:48 AM] the.mightydill
okay then


[3/6/2021 5:49 AM] the.mightydill
"Successfully started process with PID 145." and then nickel is still running :/


[3/6/2021 5:50 AM] tux_linux
does inkbox seem to run at all?


[3/6/2021 5:50 AM] the.mightydill
nickel is still running


[3/6/2021 5:50 AM] the.mightydill
probably a nm config error


[3/6/2021 5:50 AM] tux_linux
are you sure you can't ssh?


[3/6/2021 5:51 AM] the.mightydill
no i just feel like a nm action would be better


[3/6/2021 5:51 AM] tux_linux
me I set up it with kfmon


[3/6/2021 5:51 AM] tux_linux
it works well


[3/6/2021 5:52 AM] the.mightydill
...why didnt i think of that


[3/6/2021 5:52 AM] tux_linux
actually i don't think you need to be in the inkbox folder


[3/6/2021 5:53 AM] tux_linux
i was intelligent enough to call QDir to set the current directory


[3/6/2021 5:53 AM] the.mightydill
`./mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox.sh`?


[3/6/2021 5:53 AM] tux_linux
that's mine
```
[admin@storm inkbox]# cat /mnt/onboard/.adds/kfmon/config/inkbox.ini 
[watch]
filename = /mnt/onboard/inkbox.png
action = /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/inkbox.sh
label = InkBox
hidden = 0
block_spawns = 1
do_db_update = 0
db_title = InkBox
```


[3/6/2021 5:54 AM] tux_linux
remove the `.`


[3/6/2021 5:56 AM] the.mightydill
is there nano on kobo


[3/6/2021 5:56 AM] tux_linux
likely yes with the stuff


[3/6/2021 5:57 AM] tux_linux
but there is `vi` if you're desperate with telnet


[3/6/2021 5:57 AM] the.mightydill
bless niluje


[3/6/2021 5:57 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 5:57 AM] tux_linux
yep


[3/6/2021 5:58 AM] the.mightydill
how do i save as


[3/6/2021 5:58 AM] the.mightydill
nvm


[3/6/2021 5:58 AM] the.mightydill
dont need to


[3/6/2021 5:58 AM] tux_linux
well it'd be ctrl+o


[3/6/2021 5:59 AM] the.mightydill
brb


[3/6/2021 6:08 AM] the.mightydill
back


[3/6/2021 6:08 AM] tux_linux
did you set up the watch successfully?


[3/6/2021 6:08 AM] tux_linux
don't forget to put inkbox.png in /mnt/onboard


[3/6/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
you could just put some random file there and rename it to inkbox.png


[3/6/2021 6:09 AM] the.mightydill
i made a file called inkbox instead of a png


[3/6/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
oh ok that's fine too


[3/6/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
does it work?


[3/6/2021 6:11 AM] the.mightydill
rebooting after putting on the watch


[3/6/2021 6:11 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 6:12 AM] the.mightydill
nope


[3/6/2021 6:12 AM] the.mightydill
no touch input, framebuffer is messed up


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] the.mightydill
and part of nickel still shows


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] tux_linux
well try with ssh for now


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] tux_linux
and do a killall inkbox before launching the script


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] the.mightydill
no process killed


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 6:13 AM] tux_linux
should be good


[3/6/2021 6:14 AM] the.mightydill
much better


[3/6/2021 6:14 AM] tux_linux
don't know what's causing the problem then


[3/6/2021 6:15 AM] the.mightydill
how do i bring up the menu for turning pages


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
there's three buttons on the bottom of the screen


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
... no?


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] the.mightydill
i turned it once and it disappeared


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
are you on the huckleberry finn book?


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] the.mightydill
seems to be text underneath the screen as well


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
that's "the bug"


[3/6/2021 6:16 AM] tux_linux
haha


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] the.mightydill
yea...


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
change ```split_booklist = [booklist[x:x+200] for x in range(0, len(booklist),200)]   ```


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
in split.py


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] the.mightydill
selections work


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] the.mightydill
to what?


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
and replace that with a smaller value


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
like, the two 200, replace them with 150 or 175


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
it sets the number of words per page


[3/6/2021 6:17 AM] tux_linux
kill inkbox before then relaunch it after you've made the changes


[3/6/2021 6:18 AM] the.mightydill
and the menu thing?


[3/6/2021 6:18 AM] tux_linux
well yeah, that's what'll fix it


[3/6/2021 6:18 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/6/2021 6:18 AM] tux_linux
your aura is a 6" one?


[3/6/2021 6:19 AM] the.mightydill
6.8"


[3/6/2021 6:19 AM] tux_linux
oh then maybe it needs a little bit less text


[3/6/2021 6:19 AM] tux_linux
175 should work, though I'd start with 150 just to be safe


[3/6/2021 6:21 AM] the.mightydill
nothing shows up on screen


[3/6/2021 6:21 AM] the.mightydill
brightness = 0 though


[3/6/2021 6:21 AM] the.mightydill
gotta go


[3/6/2021 6:21 AM] the.mightydill
will be on tomorrow for debug


[3/6/2021 6:21 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/6/2021 6:22 AM] tux_linux
bye


[3/6/2021 11:39 AM] officeraction.
The font properties are defined in stylesheets


[3/6/2021 11:40 AM] officeraction.
you can change the sizes for all labels or for a group of labels in your qss file


[3/6/2021 11:41 AM] officeraction.
or individually like so: 
    ui->labelMangaInfoTitle->setStyleSheet("font-size: 16pt");


[3/6/2021 2:06 PM] tux_linux
Ooooooooooh


[3/6/2021 2:06 PM] tux_linux
Thx


[3/6/2021 2:06 PM] officeraction.
yep not very obvious at first


[3/6/2021 2:07 PM] tux_linux
I actually never thought of doing that


[3/6/2021 2:08 PM] tux_linux
Like, yes, I used your excellent stylesheet from the start, but I thought that because I put a grid layout, qt was scaling everything itself


[3/6/2021 2:23 PM] officeraction.
the qss is mostly from vlasovsoft but thanks 😉


[3/6/2021 2:29 PM] tux_linux
yeah, I switched since the first time I saw the stock UI on my Kobo
that thing is ugly... especially when it refreshes


[3/6/2021 2:32 PM] tux_linux
also, do you know if you'll be able to fix touch input for older models soon? I'd really like to test this in my Mini with a plain Alpine Linux or Debian backend...


[3/6/2021 2:36 PM] tux_linux
IT WORKS (the font stylesheet thing)


[3/6/2021 2:36 PM] tux_linux
thx


[3/6/2021 2:43 PM] officeraction.
there is no way for me to fix the mini since i dont have one


[3/6/2021 2:43 PM] tux_linux
i could lend mine for testing


[3/6/2021 2:44 PM] tux_linux
but the mini doesn't send the same touch events that newer devices


[3/6/2021 2:44 PM] tux_linux
although, it kind of works, like it registers your tap, but at the wrong place


[3/6/2021 2:44 PM] officeraction.
did you try with different rotations and such?


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] tux_linux
did I try


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] tux_linux
well yes


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] tux_linux
lots


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] officeraction.
you should try the scribble app


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] tux_linux
oh yeah, I'll do that


[3/6/2021 2:45 PM] officeraction.
it will be easy to see whats wrong with the touch mapping there

[3/6/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
that should help you


[3/6/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
it's like it's restricting it to a tiny rectangle on the screen


[3/6/2021 3:14 PM] tux_linux

[3/6/2021 3:14 PM] officeraction.
thanks yep thats problematic


[3/6/2021 3:15 PM] tux_linux
the touch event codes?


[3/6/2021 3:15 PM] officeraction.
no the scaling issue


[3/6/2021 3:15 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/6/2021 3:15 PM] tux_linux
do you know what's causing it?


[3/6/2021 3:24 PM] officeraction.
the root is its a different resolution for the touch panel than for the screen panel.


[3/6/2021 3:24 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/6/2021 3:25 PM] officeraction.
but dont know why it works for the others but  not for the mini


[3/6/2021 3:25 PM] tux_linux
I had issues with the Aura too


[3/6/2021 3:25 PM] tux_linux
I'll look and see if it does the same thing with scribble


[3/6/2021 3:26 PM] officeraction.
yea there were also requests to fix the aura in the forums...😅


[3/6/2021 3:30 PM] tux_linux
yup, exact same problem for the Aura


[3/6/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
only it seems that it's restricting it more to a square than a rectangle


[3/6/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
is there a way to scale the touch panel for the screen?


[3/6/2021 3:36 PM] officeraction.
yea sure


[3/6/2021 3:36 PM] officeraction.
thats what its supposed to do


[3/6/2021 3:36 PM] officeraction.
no way around digging into the code and figuring out whats wrong


[3/6/2021 3:36 PM] tux_linux
can you "scale" it manually then?


[3/6/2021 3:38 PM] officeraction.
not after it is registered


[3/6/2021 3:38 PM] officeraction.
it has to be fixed in the driver


[3/6/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
in the driver? like libkobo.so ?


[3/6/2021 3:41 PM] officeraction.
the platform plugin


[3/6/2021 3:42 PM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[3/6/2021 3:45 PM] tux_linux
```
#else
    int n = 0;

#endif
```
that? lines 407-422 of qevdevtouchhandler.cpp


[3/6/2021 3:47 PM] officeraction.
um well its all connected


[3/6/2021 3:48 PM] officeraction.
you can try to fix it i will also take a look later


[3/6/2021 3:48 PM] tux_linux
I don't even understand some parts of the program; no chance I'll be able to fix it


[3/6/2021 3:48 PM] tux_linux
I started learning C++ and Qt last week


[3/6/2021 3:57 PM] officeraction.
ok than its pretty hard 😄


[3/6/2021 3:57 PM] tux_linux
btw I put inkbox source code on github https://github.com/tux-linux/inkbox if you want to take a look

great! nice that it found its way to github


[3/6/2021 3:59 PM] tux_linux
feel free to comment my messy code


[3/6/2021 3:59 PM] tux_linux
hope it does not feel too much like that, but if you look at reader.cpp and reader.h you'll understand


[3/6/2021 4:00 PM] officeraction.
well much better than i though😜


[3/6/2021 4:00 PM] tux_linux
thx


[3/6/2021 4:01 PM] tux_linux
you can test it on your kobo if you want, the .pro file is there, or you can dump the binaries directly on the kobo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17CKIaq7NXV7-S8PTw7VkFeKHWAWhKesT/view

[3/6/2021 4:03 PM] officeraction.
just a hint its enough if you load the qss once in the main 😉


[3/6/2021 4:04 PM] tux_linux
really? it didn't work though if I opened other windows after


[3/6/2021 4:04 PM] tux_linux
like, mainwindow worked, but reader, apps, settings needed that I re-set the stylesheet


[3/6/2021 4:08 PM] officeraction.
do you open the other widgets as seperate windows?


[3/6/2021 4:08 PM] officeraction.
ok maybe then yea


[3/6/2021 4:19 PM] tux_linux
yep that's what I do


[3/6/2021 4:19 PM] tux_linux
i didn't know how to embed them in the current window


[3/6/2021 4:20 PM] tux_linux
and I had practically no internet access when I did that


[3/6/2021 4:22 PM] officeraction.
there are different ways


[3/6/2021 4:23 PM] officeraction.
the way i do it is to have a qtabwidget with a tab for all the pages in your app and then just switching the tab


[3/6/2021 4:23 PM] tux_linux
ooh


[3/6/2021 4:23 PM] tux_linux
i didn't think of it like that


[3/6/2021 4:25 PM] tux_linux
also, for the dictionary function, do you think I should trigger it when I touch the qlabel (https://wiki.qt.io/Clickable_QLabel) or is a qtimer fine?


[3/6/2021 4:26 PM] tux_linux
it's in there https://github.com/tux-linux/inkbox/blob/c32cff526c57308544889ce65842327fd6bffc21/reader.cpp#L166

its ok


[3/6/2021 4:27 PM] tux_linux
ok thanks


[3/6/2021 4:27 PM] tux_linux
that was a ... difficult ... part to make


[3/6/2021 4:28 PM] officeraction.
it will get easier in time


[3/6/2021 4:28 PM] tux_linux
yeah, I hope so
the thing was that I had to search in multiple files and return the correct definition, and if there were another definitions, get them as well


[3/6/2021 4:30 PM] tux_linux
all the dict stuff is in there

#!/bin/sh -ex

export WORD=`cat /inkbox/dictionary/word`
export LINE_MATCH=`cat index | grep -nw "$WORD" | cut -d: -f 1 | sed -n ""$1"p"`
if [ LINE_MATCH = "" ]; then
    exit 1
else
    export REGEX_DEF=`sed ""$LINE_MATCH"q;d" definitions`
    export PREVENT=`sed "1q;d" definitions`
    if [ "$REGEX_DEF" = "$PREVENT" ]; then

            echo $REGEX_DEF > /inkbox/dictionary/definition

        fi
    else
        echo $REGEX_DEF > /inkbox/dictionary/definition
        echo normal
    fi
fi
```
and that's what it does to find the definition from a given word


[3/6/2021 4:35 PM] officeraction.
anyway for the mini try this


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] officeraction.
add export QT_LOGGING_RULES=qt.qpa.input=true


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] officeraction.
and then check the logs


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] officeraction.
that can give us some hints


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] tux_linux
try what?


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] tux_linux
oh ok just the export


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] officeraction.
yep and then run and touch around a bit


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] officeraction.
and then check the logs


[3/6/2021 4:36 PM] tux_linux
yep ok, will do


[3/6/2021 4:37 PM] tux_linux
does it log to stdout ?


[3/6/2021 4:37 PM] officeraction.
yep


[3/6/2021 4:37 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux

there you go


[3/6/2021 4:40 PM] officeraction.
thx


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
sidenote


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
does kobox work on the mini yet


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] tux_linux
well I'm not sure


[3/6/2021 4:46 PM] tux_linux
it's been a long time since I tested it


[3/6/2021 4:47 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/6/2021 4:47 PM] tux_linux
I'll get back on that, maybe creating some Qt app to merge the two


[3/6/2021 4:50 PM] the.mightydill
that'd be cool


[3/6/2021 4:50 PM] officeraction.
ok try one more time with :debug


[3/6/2021 4:50 PM] tux_linux
in the platform export ?


[3/6/2021 4:50 PM] officeraction.
added to QT_QPA_PLATFORM


[3/6/2021 4:50 PM] officeraction.
yep

[3/6/2021 4:52 PM] tux_linux
this one


[3/6/2021 4:52 PM] officeraction.
ok


[3/6/2021 5:11 PM] officeraction.
ok so


[3/6/2021 5:11 PM] officeraction.
i made a branch for the platformplugin called mini


[3/6/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
great


[3/6/2021 5:11 PM] officeraction.
can you compile it and test it


[3/6/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 5:12 PM] officeraction.
it just adds some more logging for now


[3/6/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
to change the branch, it's like `git checkout minifix` ?


[3/6/2021 5:13 PM] officeraction.
and for the test it would be nice if you could just start -> touch top left corner and then the other corners in clockwise order and exit


[3/6/2021 5:13 PM] officeraction.
yep


[3/6/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
do I still add the :debug switch?


[3/6/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
because alone it doesn't seem to output anything else than... nothing


[3/6/2021 5:25 PM] officeraction.
it does now 😉


[3/6/2021 5:25 PM] officeraction.
and it also did a bit before


[3/6/2021 5:25 PM] officeraction.
but it seems i removed most


[3/6/2021 5:25 PM] tux_linux
well the one I compiled doesn't debug anything


[3/6/2021 5:26 PM] officeraction.
?


[3/6/2021 5:26 PM] tux_linux
well, nothing on stdout


[3/6/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux
maybe it's the branch switch that it didn't like


[3/6/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux
do you have a tgz/txz/wathever of the modified platform plugin source?


[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
oh now I added the :debug switch and it works


[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] officeraction.
did you put it into the platforms folder?


[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] officeraction.
ok


[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
yea ofc


[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux

[3/6/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
it shows that but when I touch the screen, nothing else happens


[3/6/2021 5:29 PM] officeraction.
you also still need the export from before


[3/6/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
Ok now it works

is that the 4 corners btw?


[3/6/2021 5:33 PM] tux_linux

so i need you to do the same thing again 😉


[3/6/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
Ok I can't right right now, I'll try probably in the next hour


[3/6/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
You see, piano practice


[3/6/2021 5:51 PM] officeraction.

hey thx but do it  again and touch all corners

that's what I did


[3/6/2021 6:57 PM] officeraction.

that one I'm sure I did


[3/6/2021 6:59 PM] officeraction.
ahh ok i think i get it now


[3/6/2021 6:59 PM] officeraction.
the touchscreen has a higher res but its not actually used


[3/6/2021 6:59 PM] tux_linux
is it easily fixable?


[3/6/2021 7:00 PM] officeraction.
yea kinad


[3/6/2021 7:00 PM] tux_linux
nice


[3/6/2021 7:16 PM] officeraction.
ok try now


[3/6/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
IT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORKS


[3/6/2021 7:25 PM] officeraction.
awsome


[3/6/2021 7:27 PM] officeraction.
can you try the aura?


[3/6/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
yep


[3/6/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
works well, no problem


[3/6/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
what did you do exactly?


[3/6/2021 7:31 PM] officeraction.
before it used the full touchscreen res as maximum(1200x1600) now it uses the screen res instaed


[3/6/2021 7:32 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/6/2021 7:32 PM] officeraction.
btw do you have to set the rotation for any device


[3/6/2021 7:32 PM] officeraction.
or is it auto?


[3/6/2021 7:33 PM] tux_linux
no I set it 90


[3/6/2021 7:33 PM] tux_linux
for the mini


[3/6/2021 7:33 PM] tux_linux
strangely for the aura it's set at 270 and all works well


[3/6/2021 7:34 PM] officeraction.
without inverts?


[3/6/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
with


[3/6/2021 7:34 PM] tux_linux
```ADDSPATH=/mnt/onboard/.adds/ QTPATH=${ADDSPATH}/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QTPATH}lib:lib: QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo:touchscreen_rotate=270:touchscreen_invert_x=1:touchscreen_invert_y=1:logicaldpitarget=0 ./inkbox
```


[3/6/2021 7:34 PM] officeraction.
thats kobo aura?


[3/6/2021 7:35 PM] tux_linux
yep


[3/6/2021 7:36 PM] officeraction.
touchscreen_rotate=270:touchscreen_invert_x=1:touchscreen_invert_y=1 is the same as touchscreen_rotate=90touchscreen_invert_x=0:touchscreen_invert_y=0 btw


[3/6/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/6/2021 7:38 PM] tux_linux
On the mini though I'm experiencing some... scaling problems


[3/6/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
like the openDialog is way too large for the screen


[3/6/2021 7:39 PM] tux_linux
though, iirc, in the code I set it to scale with the screen size


[3/6/2021 7:58 PM] tux_linux

@dill now it works on the Mini thanks to @OfficerAction who did some magic tricks with the platform plugin code


[3/6/2021 7:59 PM] officeraction.
i merged in the new rotations


[3/6/2021 7:59 PM] officeraction.
could you check if auto rotation works on all your devices now?


[3/6/2021 8:00 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/6/2021 8:00 PM] officeraction.
also dont know whats up with the scaling problems


[3/6/2021 8:01 PM] tux_linux
the auto rotation doesn't work with the mini


[3/6/2021 8:01 PM] officeraction.
with the new commit?


[3/6/2021 8:01 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/6/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
sorry, i'm so dumb


[3/6/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
mini working


[3/6/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
aura working too


[3/6/2021 8:16 PM] officeraction.
thx


[3/6/2021 8:16 PM] officeraction.
what about the other one?


[3/6/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
libra?


[3/6/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
yes, all works well


[3/6/2021 8:18 PM] officeraction.
with the auto?


[3/6/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/6/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
but no wait


[3/6/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
with the new libkobo.so the libra is giving me strange random refreshes and a recurrent `Wait for screen refresh failed!` debug message


[3/6/2021 8:20 PM] officeraction.
hmmm


[3/6/2021 8:20 PM] officeraction.
was it working before?


[3/6/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/6/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux
just tested with the old libkobo.so, it doesn't give such errors


[3/6/2021 8:24 PM] officeraction.
ok i pushed a commit


[3/6/2021 8:24 PM] officeraction.
that should fix it


[3/6/2021 8:25 PM] tux_linux

libra's working fine


[3/6/2021 8:31 PM] tux_linux
nice, now it repaints the window when I click "Options" even if I didn't tell it to


[3/6/2021 8:32 PM] tux_linux
that's an useful 'bug'
or is it?


[3/6/2021 8:32 PM] officeraction.
?

[3/6/2021 8:33 PM] tux_linux
you see the "Hide" button?


[3/6/2021 8:33 PM] tux_linux
it's actually hid when you click on it to be replaced by the options button


[3/6/2021 8:34 PM] tux_linux
I instructed hideBtn in reader.cpp to repaint the window when it's clicked, before it's been hid and replaced by the optionsBtn that showed again. that makes the screen do a plain refresh.
now I press optionsBtn and even if I didn't tell it to, it refreshes the screen anyway


[3/6/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
yeeee


[3/6/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
@OfficerAction thanks :D


[3/6/2021 8:35 PM] officeraction.
np 😉


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
also @dill , do you think your mini's screen has the best contrast? like mine's better than my Libra


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
about to do a fresh install of arch


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] officeraction.
it programmed so it should do a refresh when something changes on the screen


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
so I don't need to ui->hideBtn->repaint(); anymore


[3/6/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
that's nice


[3/6/2021 8:37 PM] officeraction.
haha yea it would be a bit troublesome if you have to repaint manually all the time 😉


[3/6/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
though, when the QLabel changes, no repaint (the QLabel is the "text" label, main text display on reader.cpp)


[3/6/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
that's great; don't change it because I wanted to create an option to set a refresh rates after n pages


[3/6/2021 8:38 PM] officeraction.
oh thats strange


[3/6/2021 8:39 PM] tux_linux
same thing for when wordsearch is hid or showed


[3/6/2021 8:40 PM] tux_linux
strange that it doesn't do it there, because it's basically the same principle of that of the menubar


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
installed basic arch


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
now for gnome and all that


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
wow, your internet speed is way faster than mine


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
me it takes like 25 mins


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
yikes :\


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
ive only got up to `pacstrap` tho


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
yeah i know


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
don't you want to try kde?


[3/6/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
it's very nice


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
hmm


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
is it possible for kde on tty2 and gnome on tty1 or am i just fantasizing


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
well you can install the two


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
on separate ttys


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
maybe


[3/6/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
haven't tried that


[3/6/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
it's a cool idea


[3/6/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
lets see


[3/6/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/6/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
but in 33 g of space


[3/6/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
you better stick to just one


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
compile kde on gentoo


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
I did it and it worked


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
oh yeah


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
i can't guarantee for gnome


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
is it faster than gnome


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
well yes a little


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
from experience


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
also, it's based on qt5


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
kde looks very nice


[3/6/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
i'll do it on gentoo

niceee


[3/6/2021 8:49 PM] tux_linux
yep, kde is awesome


[3/6/2021 8:49 PM] tux_linux
i'm not that into theming, but maybe @fermino has some cool customization ideas


[3/6/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
do i need to reinstall grub?


[3/6/2021 8:50 PM] tux_linux
ofc


[3/6/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
already have it with deepin


[3/6/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/6/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
well, in theory you could let it there


[3/6/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
but I'd reinstall it


[3/6/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
maybe you won't be able to start on deepin anymore


[3/6/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
but that's easily fixable


[3/6/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
yeah it is


[3/6/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
after all the mess of installing different distros, i'm gonna reinstall grub from deepin


[3/6/2021 8:53 PM] the.mightydill
for the sake of the wallpaper


[3/6/2021 8:55 PM] the.mightydill
only these left now

[3/6/2021 8:55 PM] the.mightydill
this seems a lot cleaner than the last 3 times i've installed arch


[3/6/2021 8:56 PM] tux_linux
No you forgot to set the root password


[3/6/2021 8:56 PM] the.mightydill
no i remembered this time :D


[3/6/2021 8:56 PM] tux_linux
Did you install DHCPcd?


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
what's that?


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Or dhclient


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Connect wired internet


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
didn't do that the last few times either


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
yeah its connected


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Oh but if network manager is there it's ok


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
yeah its there


[3/6/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
installing gnome atm


[3/6/2021 9:01 PM] the.mightydill
done!!


[3/6/2021 9:02 PM] the.mightydill
as you said, deepin is gone


[3/6/2021 9:02 PM] the.mightydill
on grub, i mean


[3/6/2021 9:02 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/6/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
Should be easy to fix
But install Gentoo before


[3/6/2021 9:05 PM] the.mightydill
ok but why gentoo first


[3/6/2021 9:06 PM] tux_linux
first?


[3/6/2021 9:07 PM] tux_linux
well gentoo will overwrite again your grub config


[3/6/2021 9:07 PM] tux_linux
so it's better to reconfigure grub after all is in place


[3/6/2021 9:07 PM] the.mightydill
oh k


[3/6/2021 9:07 PM] the.mightydill
so should i do gentoo now?


[3/6/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
i'll install some other distros today and tomorrow, and start compiling gentoo by sunday night at the very most


[3/6/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
will i need a fan to prevent it from exploding


[3/6/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
?


[3/6/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
what other distros would you recommend @tux-linux


[3/6/2021 9:28 PM] the.mightydill
DEBIAN


[3/6/2021 9:29 PM] the.mightydill
red hat?

archbang looks like it would be good for beginners


[3/6/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
what i'll do is install fedora right now, and use kde on that one as well


[3/6/2021 9:46 PM] officeraction.
you can take a look at manjaro 😉 it is very powerful, all the arch packages but also quite beginner friendly


[3/6/2021 9:50 PM] the.mightydill
thx!


[3/6/2021 9:54 PM] the.mightydill
`dd`ing the image to the usb for fedora


[3/6/2021 9:54 PM] the.mightydill
dont worry i double checked and triple checked the command


[3/6/2021 9:58 PM] tux_linux
No do Gentoo, then you'll be able to reconfigure grub so you'll be able to boot Arch deepin and gentoo


[3/6/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
no first the others, then gentoo


[3/6/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/6/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
because gentoo *will* take a long time


[3/6/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/6/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
done the flash


[3/6/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
But does it matter? You'll not be able to access the other distros while on Gentoo


[3/6/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/6/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
but i feel like installing the others first would be better


[3/6/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
If you want


[3/6/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
btw i forgot my old reddit thing so my new one is u/themightydill


[3/6/2021 10:01 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[3/6/2021 10:01 PM] the.mightydill
gonna install fedora


[3/6/2021 10:01 PM] the.mightydill
btw is it gui or cli install


[3/6/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
nvm its apparently a "gooey" install


[3/6/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
gonna install, bye


[3/6/2021 10:05 PM] tux_linux
Goooeey
G.  U. I


[3/6/2021 10:05 PM] tux_linux
No?


[3/6/2021 10:11 PM] the.mightydill
yep yep


[3/6/2021 10:11 PM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/6/2021 10:11 PM] the.mightydill
on fedora rn, about to install


[3/6/2021 10:11 PM] the.mightydill
KDE is nice


[3/6/2021 10:11 PM] the.mightydill
installing


[3/6/2021 10:48 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux apparently with fedora, all 3 os'es are showing up on grub!

will try manjaro now


[3/6/2021 10:56 PM] tux_linux
nice


[3/6/2021 10:58 PM] the.mightydill
my wifi is speedrunning rn


[3/6/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
lucky you


[3/6/2021 10:58 PM] the.mightydill
i mean, ethernet


[3/6/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
its very unusual tbh


[3/6/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
getting the gnome thing


[3/6/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
also, @tux-linux, is there a package manager in fedora


[3/6/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
i mean


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
what is the package manager in fedora


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
:p


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
`dnf`


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
thx


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
but i don't know much about it


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
i think that to install a package you do `dnf install package`


[3/6/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
i could be wrong though


[3/6/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
yup, did a `dnf --help`


[3/6/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
do you like kde?


[3/6/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
i like it a lot, but not as much as gnome to be honest


[3/6/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
you can check out r/unixporn


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] tux_linux
you'll get lots of ideas for your setup


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
yeah ok


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
also getting ready for manjaro


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
what im the most excited about is gentoo


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
will i need fans btw


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] tux_linux
i don't think so


[3/6/2021 11:06 PM] tux_linux
unless your computer shuts down when you have high cpu usage, you should be good


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
don't put it in a sauna tho


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] the.mightydill
actually, pretty sure it does crash when it has high cpu usage


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
then


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
open it


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
put it between two chairs


[3/6/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
put a fan underneath


[3/6/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
set the speed to max


[3/6/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
and you'll be good


[3/6/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/6/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
i cant get in the sudoers file... again :/


[3/6/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
what distro


[3/6/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
fedora kde


[3/6/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
can you `su root` at least?


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
well do the same thing as arch it should work


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] the.mightydill
i did


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
or maybe `addgroup dill sudo`


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] the.mightydill
uncommented lines with `%wheel`


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
in some distros there's a sudo group


[3/6/2021 11:14 PM] the.mightydill
nope


[3/6/2021 11:14 PM] tux_linux
that? https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/adding_user_to_sudoers_file/

well


[3/6/2021 11:33 PM] the.mightydill
you get the idea


[3/6/2021 11:34 PM] tux_linux
yes

flashing the manjaro image


[3/6/2021 11:38 PM] the.mightydill
today is a really good day for my laptop apparently


[3/6/2021 11:38 PM] the.mightydill
the other one takes 5 mbps this takes 17 mbps


[3/6/2021 11:38 PM] tux_linux
Le calme avant la tempête
as we say here


[3/6/2021 11:38 PM] the.mightydill
the calm has the something, is what my brain came up with


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] the.mightydill
oh wAait


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] the.mightydill
the calm before the storm


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] tux_linux
yep


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] the.mightydill
halfway done


[3/6/2021 11:39 PM] the.mightydill
your first language is french right


[3/6/2021 11:40 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/6/2021 11:40 PM] the.mightydill
if i had done "French Immersion" here, i'd have had a lot more experience with french


[3/6/2021 11:40 PM] the.mightydill
but ive been having english schooling, with french subject


[3/6/2021 11:40 PM] the.mightydill
brb


[3/6/2021 11:46 PM] the.mightydill
back, and it appears manjaro has finished flashing


[3/6/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux any idea whether it is a gooey install or a clee install ;p


[3/6/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
gooey


[3/6/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
also how do i change my device name


[3/6/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
`hostname` but might not stay


[3/6/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
edit /etc/hostname


[3/6/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/6/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
what would i write


[3/6/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
fedora


[3/6/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
so just `fedoralinux` in the file


[3/6/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/6/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
ty


[3/6/2021 11:50 PM] the.mightydill
works


[3/6/2021 11:50 PM] the.mightydill

installing again after having to leave before installing :/


[3/7/2021 2:41 AM] the.mightydill
manjaro wont install


[3/7/2021 2:41 AM] the.mightydill
looking into debian


[3/7/2021 3:28 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux is debian gooey


[3/7/2021 3:40 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/7/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
Except the netinstall
But it's like GUI in cli for the netinstall


[3/7/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
yeeeeeeeeeee


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
installed fedora and debian


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
nice


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
in *one day*


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
next challenge is gentoo


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
4 distros, fully functional


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
correction


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
4 distros, fully functional, ready to break


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/7/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
you never know what can happen with that


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
true


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
i also have to delete one of them to make space for gentoo :/


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
which one will you choose?


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
i feel like i would remove debian


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
i suggest you keep debian, it's rock-solid stable


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
hmmm


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
deepin?


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
so when all your distros will break, at least debian will hopefully work


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
yeah, if you want


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
nah, i think fedora


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
but deepin is also based on debian


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
so it's your take


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
i'll take fedora


[3/7/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
*cries hard*


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
no, i'm just sad that you don't like kde


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
i love kde


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
ok you'll set up gentoo with it


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
my bad


[3/7/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/7/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
debian is actually 20 gib


[3/7/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
what are the others?


[3/7/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
33 mostly


[3/7/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
thinking about it I'm not sure you'll have enough of 33 gib for gentoo


[3/7/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
but you should be ok


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
```1Device     Boot     Start       End  Sectors Size Id Type

```


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
33 gib wouldnt be enough for gentoo?


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
maybe 40?


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
yes; at the end


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
not when you compile


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
because object files and artifacts take up a LOT of space


[3/7/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
like, to compile GCC, it takes like 10G of free space but it gives you a binary of only ~50M


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
yikes


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
i'll go with 40 then...


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
as much as you can


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
no idea where i put fedora


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
i think sda3


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
but what's in sda1?


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
or 5


[3/7/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
deepin


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
arch is 2


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
fedora is 3 i think


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
I thought for a second that you let 33gib of space for grub


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
lol no


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
4 is container


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
5 is debian


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
6 is... swap i guess


[3/7/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
makes sense


[3/7/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
i just made sense out of something ive been tryna figure out in my head all day


[3/7/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
what


[3/7/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
really had no idea where to put everything


[3/7/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
yeah partitioning is quite the task sometimes


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
def


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
...sda4 contains 5 and 6?


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
but there was one time where I had like 11 distros in one disk


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
wooo


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
how much storage


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
i think it was 320g


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
this is 150g


[3/7/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
150 not 15!


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
I had a giant boot menu


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
yikes


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
well it was cool


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
22 entries


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
yeah, approx


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
with the "Advanced options" sometimes


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
how can you get rid of the advanced options thing btw


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
idk


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
yeah or the rescue


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
tbh you should keep it


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
it actually has a purpose


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
give you root access in an initramfs when you can't access the main system


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
and also whats "Linux linux" i fell off my seat when i read that


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
ahhh i see


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
it's like "Linux" the distro and "linux" the kernel because the devs didn't appropriately set the name


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 5:23 AM] tux_linux
if i'm not mistaken


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
prob


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
but now I'm more on custom liveusbs


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
so I don't worry about grub


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
that's why I don't know much about configuring it and all


[3/7/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
i dont need the other computer anymore for images


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
i use `dd` *SAFELY* though


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
now, at this moment, I use Ubuntu on an ssd for inkbox, because i have qtcreator and all setup


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
but you knew that etcher was available for linux, did you?


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
...*no*


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] the.mightydill
hahaha


[3/7/2021 5:25 AM] tux_linux
it's a shiny appimage


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
.deb?


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
appimage


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
google that a bit


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
and you'll see that it's the best thing since sliced bread


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
OH


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
ive been looking for this kind of thing for a long long time


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
it's like an executable squashfs archive


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
standalone


[3/7/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
I created some a while ago


[3/7/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
without installation


[3/7/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
it was neat


[3/7/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill

[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
well then im ditching `dd`


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
you'll need it in cli


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
no, for flashing


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
well yeah, but you'll need it in cli if something goes wrong


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
such as?


[3/7/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
the nice thing is that it's available in most initramfs and it's in every linux system that you'll encounter


[3/7/2021 5:29 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/7/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
well, X suddenly decides
"Hey, why not cause a random error and not being able to launch myself anymore, forever"


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
it did that with my debian vm last week


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
when that happens i'd do a fresh reinstall


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
dang


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
yeah it's like it's saying you that it wants to be reinstalled


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
i think ive reinstalled arch 3 times in 2 weeks :/


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/7/2021 5:30 AM] tux_linux
absolutely normal


[3/7/2021 5:31 AM] tux_linux
you know, when I do archisos, I reinstall arch 3 times in one day


[3/7/2021 5:31 AM] the.mightydill
dang


[3/7/2021 5:31 AM] the.mightydill
yeah it'd be nice to have the themes, tap to click, discord, chromium, and all of that in one image though


[3/7/2021 5:31 AM] tux_linux
well you won't get discord ofc


[3/7/2021 5:31 AM] the.mightydill
why not?

that is useful


[3/7/2021 5:32 AM] the.mightydill
ah yes


[3/7/2021 5:32 AM] tux_linux
but actually... maybe


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
wooo, that'd be *more* than useful


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
yeah i used that to create chromium appimages and such


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
time for me to go


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/7/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
ok bye


[3/7/2021 5:34 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, in arch


[3/7/2021 5:35 AM] ferminolaiz
There's an AUR repo for discord


[3/7/2021 5:35 AM] ferminolaiz
So you literally do `yay discord` and there you go


[3/7/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
yeah, I think he was talking about an appimage of discord


[3/7/2021 5:35 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh


[3/7/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
which *should* be doable


[3/7/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
yeah, it should be pretty easy, since the package provided from the official website is a tar archive with all the depends

[3/7/2021 7:08 PM] the.mightydill
good morning, yall


[3/7/2021 7:08 PM] tux_linux
here it's 13:08


[3/7/2021 7:08 PM] the.mightydill
yeeee


[3/7/2021 7:09 PM] the.mightydill
here its 11:08


[3/7/2021 7:09 PM] the.mightydill
i slept in today because i slept at like 3am last night :/


[3/7/2021 7:09 PM] tux_linux
ready to install gentoo then?


[3/7/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/7/2021 7:16 PM] tux_linux
let's goooo then


[3/7/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
YESSIR


[3/7/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
hmm


[3/7/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
wait i'll open up the guide


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
that is a *long* guide


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
well sure; it's gentoo


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
you should check out the linux from scratch guide


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
maybe later


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
how long will this take


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
well, I meant check the number of pages


[3/7/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/7/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
well it's your first install


[3/7/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
so


[3/7/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/7/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
~1 day to get it on the track


[3/7/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
it took me hours to install arch the first time, and now it takes me like 10 minutes


[3/7/2021 7:22 PM] tux_linux
transposition for gentoo
`it took me days to install gentoo the first time, and now it takes me like 2 hours`


[3/7/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 7:22 PM] tux_linux
well the 2 hours is for the base system, once you get things going


[3/7/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
and how long would kde take to compile


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
hmm on my main pc it took 2 days i think


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
yikesss


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
and if you want to compile firefox


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
that takes 1 day


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
chromium?


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
maybe more


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
NOOOOOO


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
yeek


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
well maybe


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
but build time would increase by 5000%


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
why does everything need to *compile*


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
because it's gentoo


[3/7/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
fair


[3/7/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
wait so LFS is basically creating your own distro


[3/7/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
that's fun


[3/7/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
also, you can customize your system and only install the things you want, tweak the source code to install only the things you want


[3/7/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/7/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill
so how long?


[3/7/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
well if firefox took 1 day


[3/7/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill
a week?


[3/7/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
don't know exactly


[3/7/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Chromium

{Embed}
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Chromium
Chromium


[3/7/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
also, with the amount of ram you have, it would fail at the final linking and thus leave you with an unusable build


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
`emerge` would take the most time, right


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
maybe compiling falkon is a good idea


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
swap?


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
that's also a bad idea but maybe


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
falkon should get you going though; it's chromium but lighter


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
and it performs equally well


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
i have 17G ready for swap... a bit overkill but you cant be too prepared


[3/7/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
the problem is, falkon isnt supported by discord


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
iirc


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
impossible


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
is there a gentoo app for discord?


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
wait i'll try it now


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
well you can download the prebuilt binaries from the official website


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
let me guess


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
it'll take months to compile


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
falkon?


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
discord


[3/7/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
you can't compile it


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] tux_linux
there's no source


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
oh yeah


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
closed


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill

choose download, then tar.gz


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
oh yeah


[3/7/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
or .deb


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
well won't work on gentoo


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
what distro are you on right now


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
im on arch


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
ubuntu
because I need qtcreator for inkbox and it's all configured up and ready


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
otherwise i'd be on my archiso


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/7/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
archiso?


[3/7/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
arent those only for installs


[3/7/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/7/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
wait nevermind


[3/7/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux
it's a liveusb

ohhh


[3/7/2021 7:31 PM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/7/2021 7:32 PM] the.mightydill
btw, you can change your *username* to tux-linux as well, just go to settings


[3/7/2021 7:32 PM] the.mightydill
if you want


[3/7/2021 7:32 PM] tux_linux
yeah i can stay Nicolas for more formal things


[3/7/2021 7:32 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/7/2021 7:33 PM] the.mightydill
dill is my default name, for more "formal" things i use nicknames on servers


[3/7/2021 7:33 PM] the.mightydill
for some reason, my moms phone doesnt want to install discord


[3/7/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
so i'll use the other windows laptop


[3/7/2021 7:34 PM] the.mightydill
just gotta flash the gentoo img


[3/7/2021 7:44 PM] the.mightydill
ok flash done


[3/7/2021 7:44 PM] the.mightydill
see you later


[3/7/2021 7:44 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/7/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
currently unpacking stage3 tarball


[3/7/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
whole lot of output


[3/7/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
`tar: timestamp <time stamp> is <value> in the future`


[3/7/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux is that bad...?


[3/7/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/7/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
what's the output of `date` ?


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
i set it to MST


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
manually


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
the output of `date`


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
because thats what it said in the guide...


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
oh shi-


[3/7/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
march 3


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
do i set it again?


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
if you have a ntp client that would be ideal


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
`ntp-client` ?


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
`ntpd -q -g`?


[3/7/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
oh yes


[3/7/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
do i have to `tar` again


[3/7/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
did it finish?


[3/7/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
the `ntpd`? yes


[3/7/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
you didn't press ctrl+c ?


[3/7/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
no the tar command


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
why would i do that


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
it should be correct


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
well, to stop the program


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
the `tar` finished


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
and all the output said it was in the future


[3/7/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
but it appears to have extracted


[3/7/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill
at least `/mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf` was extracted, which leads me to believe the entire thing was extracted


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
it's saying that the files were in the future


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
so when you'll set the date, it won't be in the future and everything will be nice


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
so the `ntpd` fixed it?


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
should have, yes


[3/7/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
then im ready to optimize make.conf


[3/7/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux
but test with `date` again if it shows the correct date


[3/7/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
k


[3/7/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/7/2021 8:22 PM] the.mightydill
i only edit the `FLAGS`?


[3/7/2021 8:22 PM] tux_linux
i think so


[3/7/2021 8:22 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:31 PM] the.mightydill
is it just me, or are consoles and livecd environments more keyboard sensitive than gui's


[3/7/2021 8:31 PM] tux_linux
it's just you


[3/7/2021 8:32 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/7/2021 8:32 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 8:34 PM] the.mightydill
wait, my boot partition is /dev/sda


[3/7/2021 8:34 PM] the.mightydill
am i supposed to mount that @tux-linux


[3/7/2021 8:34 PM] tux_linux
what is in /dev/sda?


[3/7/2021 8:34 PM] the.mightydill
lets see


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] tux_linux
it's not mandatory; you can keep kernels in the /boot folder as well


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
"/dev/sda"


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
is in /dev/sda


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
and its yellow


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
a yellow file


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
it says `mount /dev/sda /boot`


[3/7/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
if the boot partition is /dev/sda


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
that's crazy


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
are you sure they didn't put a number after sda?


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
no, their boot partition was sda2


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
but mine is sda...


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
sda is the disk


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
hmm


[3/7/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
did you follow uefi instructions without noticing?


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
idk


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
i mounted the necessary dirs


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
`/sys, /dev, ` etc.


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
continue but don't mount boot


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
wait you mean dont *mount* anything *on* /boot, right


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/7/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
it should be okay


[3/7/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
right now im doing `emerge-webrsync`


[3/7/2021 8:39 PM] the.mightydill
`emerge` is the compile thing later on, right?


[3/7/2021 8:39 PM] tux_linux
it's the package manager


[3/7/2021 8:39 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
so that compiles kde, etc?


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
`emerge kde` later on?


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] tux_linux
it retrieves the source, then tells gcc g++ to compile


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] tux_linux
not that simple


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] tux_linux
but it's similar


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
okay


[3/7/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
right now, `emerge --sync --quiet`


[3/7/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
because im doing all the optional things


[3/7/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
`eselect profile set 2` for kde?

just an example


[3/7/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
but check the profiles first


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
for me it says plasma/systemd or something


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
they could've changed


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
don't take systemd


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
openrc is better and lighter


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
so you could take the default


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
desktop/plasma?


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/7/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
k


[3/7/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
also, openrc has shiny colors at boot-up


[3/7/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux

yep


[3/7/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/7/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
im pretty sure gentoo liveusb uses openrc


[3/7/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
yeah it does


[3/7/2021 8:49 PM] the.mightydill
the USE variable has *way* too many args


[3/7/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
this is probably where i'll mess up

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-0DE4C.png


[3/7/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
can the use variable be changed later? @tux-linux


[3/7/2021 8:53 PM] the.mightydill
apparently the profile already sets it so im not worrying about that


[3/7/2021 9:06 PM] the.mightydill
installing kernel sources


[3/7/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux how do i configure the kernel


[3/7/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
like, how do i do `make menuconfig` then `<*>` or `[*]`


[3/7/2021 9:30 PM] tux_linux

[3/8/2021 2:34 AM] the.mightydill
i think my computer is melting


[3/8/2021 2:34 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux


[3/8/2021 2:34 AM] tux_linux
it's normal


[3/8/2021 2:34 AM] tux_linux
haha


[3/8/2021 2:34 AM] tux_linux
did you put a fan?


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
well; do it


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
or it will shut down in the next minutes


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
something that you don't want


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] the.mightydill
actually its been compiling for 4 or 5 hrs


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
oh then


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
maybe it won't shutdown


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] tux_linux
but it would probably thank you if you put a fan there


[3/8/2021 2:35 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/8/2021 2:36 AM] the.mightydill
brb i'll get a fan


[3/8/2021 2:36 AM] the.mightydill
if i have one


[3/8/2021 2:36 AM] tux_linux
also, it could speed up compiling a little since it no longer would need to throttle


[3/8/2021 2:36 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/8/2021 2:38 AM] the.mightydill
i asked my dad and he said to put it over some open air... so i'll put it between two chairs like you said


[3/8/2021 2:39 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/8/2021 2:39 AM] the.mightydill
do i need ethernet plugged in


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] tux_linux
well is it already plugged in?


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] tux_linux
and don't unplug it


[3/8/2021 2:40 AM] the.mightydill

your computer is ... well not recoverable if not by a reboot


[3/8/2021 3:24 AM] the.mightydill
Why not


[3/8/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
oh ok it's showing actual text


[3/8/2021 3:25 AM] the.mightydill
Yep


[3/8/2021 3:25 AM] the.mightydill
I'd be very worried otherwise


[3/8/2021 3:25 AM] tux_linux
ok
i had a problem with my 2010 mac some weeks ago when trying to install gentoo on it, it froze up at some point and it printed random data on the screen


[3/8/2021 3:25 AM] the.mightydill
Yikes


[3/8/2021 3:26 AM] the.mightydill
Got to go


[3/8/2021 3:26 AM] tux_linux
and then it hung and could not be recovered except by a reboot (which ,of course, would've obligated me to start all over again)


[3/8/2021 3:26 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/8/2021 3:26 AM] the.mightydill

[3/8/2021 6:09 PM] pgaskin
Put it by a window slightly open


[3/8/2021 6:09 PM] tux_linux
also, that can work


[3/8/2021 6:10 PM] pgaskin
If anyone uses EFI, I suggest rEFInd over grub. It's much nicer for most configurations.

[3/8/2021 7:52 PM] tux_linux
huh


[3/8/2021 7:52 PM] tux_linux
sometimes some program just decides "hey, why not segfault today and force my owner to reinstall the system?"


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] ferminolaiz
I literally installed it today .\_\_\____.


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux
what os?


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] ferminolaiz
And its wget!


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] ferminolaiz
Debian 10


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux
kernel version?


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] ferminolaiz
4.19.0-14


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] ferminolaiz
(686-pae)


[3/8/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux
other programs work as they should?


[3/8/2021 7:54 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[3/8/2021 7:54 PM] tux_linux
well, try with curl


[3/8/2021 7:54 PM] ferminolaiz
I will


[3/8/2021 7:54 PM] ferminolaiz
The thing is


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] ferminolaiz
I kind of want to figure it out


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
I understand


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
maybe an apt upgrade?


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
try with strace


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] ferminolaiz
Just did it this morning


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] ferminolaiz
But Ill try


[3/8/2021 7:55 PM] tux_linux
yeah, and maybe strace will help


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] tux_linux
the program did actually run, so it's not entirely broken


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] tux_linux
what if you try to get another file?


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] ferminolaiz
It works


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] ferminolaiz
I think it might be related to a redirection


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/8/2021 7:56 PM] tux_linux
maybe it's some strange feature that the running kernel doesn't support?


[3/8/2021 7:57 PM] ferminolaiz
Probably


[3/8/2021 7:57 PM] ferminolaiz
And the fact that this computer is not a full 686


[3/8/2021 7:57 PM] tux_linux
it's like a 386? 586?


[3/8/2021 7:57 PM] ferminolaiz
As far as I found it's a 486


[3/8/2021 7:58 PM] ferminolaiz
But debian 10 works so I assumed it was a 586 (as support for 486 has ben dropped since debian 6/7 iirc)


[3/8/2021 7:58 PM] tux_linux
yeah, debian 10 works no problem on my 2000 thin client too


[3/8/2021 7:59 PM] tux_linux
you could try alpine, that works well too


[3/8/2021 7:59 PM] tux_linux
the gitea server is running alpine


[3/8/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
huh. it seems that it's down for now.
well, it stayed 9 days in uptime, that's ok


[3/8/2021 8:02 PM] ferminolaiz
hahahahah


[3/8/2021 8:03 PM] tux_linux
i'll go and check if it has not burned later today

[3/9/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
idk


[3/9/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
or maybe its finally starting to compile xorg

did you start emerge for plasma?

soon, well it'll compile Plasma, you'll be grateful that sometimes CMake and Ninja are the build engines, and you'll hate `make`


[3/9/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
... because guess what
they show \~~ progress \~~


[3/9/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
:O


[3/9/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
`make install plasma` or something?


[3/9/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/9/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
this?

[3/9/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
make is a build system
ninja and cmake are others

basically, all of those complicated gcc/g++ commands that you see flowing on the screen are executed by the build systems, in an automated way; so the build systems tell the compilers what to compile, and in which order


[3/9/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/9/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
but then i wont be able to see the progress because the text will be too fast...


[3/9/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
the text is already speedrunning for cfg-update


[3/9/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux

ah


[3/9/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
oh wait really


[3/9/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
thats different


[3/9/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
well, at the bottom of the screen


[3/9/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
im used to the computer spitting out endless output


[3/9/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
that's not a cool thing when you use serial on the kobo tho


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
the bottom will show progress, and the rest of the screen will be speedrunning?


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
it won't show all the "noise"


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
like the image above


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
oh!


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
well thats very different


[3/9/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
but; it will not be always that


[3/9/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
also very pleasant for me because my siblings are gawking at the screen and shouting to each other to look at my laptop because its spitting out a lot of code :p


[3/9/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
hahhahahahahaa


[3/9/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
btw


[3/9/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux

[3/9/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux

[3/9/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
you should also google `sed`, it's very useful for a lot of things


[3/9/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
i use it in kobox


[3/9/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
so now i'll go try and emerge xorg-server, xorg-drivers, and xorg-x11


[3/9/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
\*inkbox


[3/9/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill

`"change USE: '+bindist'"`


[3/9/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
for openssl and something to do with qt


[3/9/2021 4:29 AM] tux_linux
you want to know how to change the USE flags?


[3/9/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
`make.conf?`


[3/9/2021 4:29 AM] tux_linux
idk


[3/9/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
i never understood that
but the thing is; i didn't change them and kde compiled and worked fine


[3/9/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/9/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
but -- you should change them


[3/9/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
its telling me i need a bindist


[3/9/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
google how to change use flags gentoo


[3/9/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill

here's whats bugging me

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-3C8F2.png


[3/9/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
maybe add bindist in /etc/portage/make.conf


[3/9/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
and read this https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag

{Embed}
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag
USE flag


[3/9/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
no idea what to do so i just added a line that said
`BINDIST=""`


[3/9/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
what are the contents of the file ?


[3/9/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
oh you're in a tty


[3/9/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
https://tpaste.us/


[3/9/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
some flags and some dirs 
also this is curious `# NOTE: This stage was built with the bindist Use flag enabled.`


[3/9/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
well idk


[3/9/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
maybe it's enabled


[3/9/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
ill ask in the gentoo discord


[3/9/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
there's a gentoo discord?


[3/9/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill

[3/10/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
libdir is doing something


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
well since when?


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
no idea


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
you should wait


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill

[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
no, its been stuck for hours


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
ctrl alt f2


[3/10/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux

[3/10/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
what does it say on tty1 ?


[3/10/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
wait after 3 hours of being stuck, its compiling again


[3/10/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
well, that's luck


[3/10/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/10/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
what I'm most afraid of is when you'll install grub


[3/10/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
with the setup you have, it has a minimum 70% failure rate


[3/10/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
btw @dill , I've set up my Mini with Alpine Linux installed bare metal, and installed inkbox on it. I added a few features since the last time, there's now USBMS, font size, usbnet bridge setup, and a few nice other things here and there
would you like to get the image for it? it boots straight into InkBox, no nickel bloat or anything like that


[3/10/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
YEE


[3/10/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
i installed grub already


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
well, we'll see if it worked


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
it does


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
gentoo is the only menu entry tho


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
oh, you already rebooted?


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
that's better than nothing ;p


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
yup


[3/10/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
would you like some screenshots of inkbox while I upload the thing?


[3/10/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
sure


[3/10/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
i also added a menu to "quit"


[3/10/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/10/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
now you have four shiny new options


[3/10/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
only suspend doesn't work for now

[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
does nickel exist?


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
no, not at all


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
it's a plain Alpine Linux system running natively on the kobo


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
so like kobox


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
well, yes, but native


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
no chroot


[3/10/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
thats better


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
so you have real openrc init system and services


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
:o


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
so is there a gui


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
well; of course


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
well i mean


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
it might not have had one


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
like my gentoo system right now :p


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
it's running inkbox


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
so it boots, then starts inkbox


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
automatically


[3/10/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill

[3/10/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/10/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
then, just dd and it's there


[3/10/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
also, it features the updated and enhanced new kernel


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
cant dd


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
because of gentoo compiling


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
you can


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
tty2


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
also btw its speedrunning again


[3/10/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
you can plug in an external drive with the img

no it's ok


[3/10/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
wait after xorg server


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
i also have to compile drivers and x11 before emerging plasma?


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
that gonna take me until 2022


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
not that much


[3/10/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/10/2021 5:38 AM] the.mightydill
also i saw that its compiling firefox


[3/10/2021 5:38 AM] the.mightydill
so thats gonna take a long time


[3/10/2021 5:38 AM] the.mightydill

[3/10/2021 3:06 PM] the.mightydill
drivers took about a minute


[3/10/2021 3:06 PM] the.mightydill
so now x11


[3/10/2021 3:08 PM] the.mightydill
also i dont want to use more cpu


[3/10/2021 3:08 PM] the.mightydill
with dd


[3/10/2021 3:08 PM] the.mightydill
i can use the windows craptop i'm on right now


[3/10/2021 3:17 PM] tux_linux
yeah, maybe with etcher


[3/10/2021 3:17 PM] tux_linux
but dd won't increase your cpu usage at all


[3/10/2021 3:18 PM] tux_linux

⬆️ that's from 10 minutes ago i think


[3/10/2021 3:25 PM] the.mightydill

configuration process


[3/10/2021 3:25 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/10/2021 3:25 PM] tux_linux
it's like running `./configure` before `make`


[3/10/2021 3:25 PM] the.mightydill
looks like its on 50 of 75


[3/10/2021 3:25 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] tux_linux
well; install plasma after; I think there are about 600 pkgs to emerge


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] the.mightydill
yikes


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] the.mightydill
i'll do that before heading out to school then


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] tux_linux
if you can, it'd be a very good idea


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] tux_linux
(if it finishes ofc)


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] the.mightydill
yea, but it depends if xorg-x11 finishes


[3/10/2021 3:26 PM] the.mightydill
probably will though


[3/10/2021 3:27 PM] the.mightydill
it looks like its 2/3 of the way done


[3/10/2021 3:27 PM] tux_linux
nice


[3/10/2021 3:27 PM] the.mightydill
first do i switch to the kde profile, or do i emerge kde


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] tux_linux
you should switch to the kde profile


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] tux_linux
then it will probably give you a thousand errors, as usual


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] the.mightydill
first?


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] the.mightydill
it will

[3/10/2021 3:28 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/10/2021 3:29 PM] tux_linux
there's plasma-desktop, which will take less time to build


[3/10/2021 3:29 PM] tux_linux
and will only install core things

after that, you'll want to emerge maybe dolphin, konsole, and firefox if not done already


[3/10/2021 3:30 PM] tux_linux
in that case, you'll be able to emerge them after


[3/10/2021 3:30 PM] tux_linux
but it's up to you


[3/10/2021 3:30 PM] the.mightydill
i think plasma-meta would be easier


[3/10/2021 3:30 PM] the.mightydill
but slower, if im correct


[3/10/2021 3:30 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/10/2021 3:31 PM] the.mightydill
probably going to take as much time as emerging plasma-desktop + firefox, dolphin, konsole, etc


[3/10/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
maybe

[3/10/2021 3:36 PM] the.mightydill

[3/10/2021 3:37 PM] tux_linux
change profile then plasma


[3/10/2021 3:37 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/10/2021 3:38 PM] the.mightydill
i set profile


[3/10/2021 3:38 PM] the.mightydill
stable, right


[3/10/2021 3:38 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/10/2021 3:38 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/10/2021 3:38 PM] tux_linux
better not go to unstable for now


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
then i did `emerge kde-plasma/plasma-meta`


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] tux_linux
no `--ask` ?


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
no...


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
AAAAGH


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] tux_linux
shouldn't be that important


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
error again


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
bindist again


[3/10/2021 3:39 PM] the.mightydill
for use flags


[3/10/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
prepend it


[3/10/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
k


[3/10/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
`USE=+bindist` or something like that before `emerge`


[3/10/2021 3:40 PM] tux_linux
if there are space in the use flags, enclose the var in quote marks


[3/10/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
i tried that before, apparently use flags cant start with `+`


[3/10/2021 3:41 PM] tux_linux
well, maybe just try to put bindist  alone ?


[3/10/2021 3:41 PM] the.mightydill
i did `USE="bindist" emerge kde-plasma/plasma-meta`


[3/10/2021 3:41 PM] tux_linux
should work


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] the.mightydill
`emerging (1 of 269)`


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] tux_linux
hold your breath haha


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] the.mightydill
heh im gonna be wondering if this is done when im at school


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] the.mightydill
probably not though


[3/10/2021 3:42 PM] tux_linux
and this evening you'll come back and see it complained about another error


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] tux_linux
so don't have high hopes, it's my take


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] the.mightydill
yeah definitely


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] the.mightydill
gotta go


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] the.mightydill
bye!


[3/10/2021 3:43 PM] tux_linux
ok bye


[3/11/2021 12:02 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux its compiling


[3/11/2021 12:02 AM] the.mightydill
emerging 162/269


[3/11/2021 12:02 AM] the.mightydill
was probably a good idea to start it before heading out to school


[3/11/2021 1:45 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, nice!

[3/11/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
still compiling


[3/11/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
looks like it has 30 pkgs left


[3/11/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
:DDD


[3/11/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
should be done by tomorrow morning :/


[3/11/2021 4:03 AM] tux_linux
yeah, that's gentoo...


[3/11/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
yup

Fiash it with that
gunzip -c inkbox.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0

[3/12/2021 12:40 AM] tux_linux
please give feedback if you can; it'd be really awesome

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/12/2021 1:14 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux if theres alpine, can there be openbox


[3/12/2021 1:18 AM] tux_linux
theoritically, yes


[3/12/2021 1:19 AM] the.mightydill
how would we do it


[3/12/2021 1:19 AM] tux_linux
same as installing xorg in the chroot


[3/12/2021 1:19 AM] tux_linux
but the software would be outdated


[3/12/2021 1:20 AM] the.mightydill
why?


[3/12/2021 1:20 AM] tux_linux
the mini's kernel can only run up to alpine 3.10


[3/12/2021 1:20 AM] the.mightydill
OH


[3/12/2021 1:20 AM] the.mightydill
oops caps lock


[3/12/2021 1:20 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/12/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
btw emerging chroium


[3/12/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
gotta go bye


[3/12/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
oook good luck


[3/12/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
still compiling


[3/12/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
what i dont understand is, why isnt it precompiled like for arch


[3/12/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill
this is why i hate opera sometimes

[3/12/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
that's annoying
but that happens with any chromium-based browser that I encountered to have seen


[3/12/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
to give you the maximum options for customizing and stripping down the system to what you want


[3/12/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
true


[3/12/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
i decided to just use chrome


[3/12/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
*about to scream*

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-B4C3A.png


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
what browser do you use


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
agh discord


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
now its firefox


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
i use discord in the browser


[3/12/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
i miss when firefox was included in windows 7/8.1


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
i tested with the app, and honestly it doesn't add much features that i need


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
it was never included


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
for me it was


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
probably oem-included


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
idk how


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
i use vivaldi also, but firefox is doing what i want for now, it's a wonderful browser for normal pcs


[3/12/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
i.e. not kobos


[3/12/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
haha firefox is slow on my aura


[3/12/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
well you're lucky if it even launches before crashing


[3/12/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
at least the installer downloaded

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-0E622.png


[3/12/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
yeah definitely


[3/12/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
nice


[3/12/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
on firefox now


[3/12/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
firefox's ui on windows is better than linux's


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
hm


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
i think linux's is better


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
it depends


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
im on windows rn


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
i love the purple background tho


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
because linux is emerging chromium


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
on what?


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
which linux hasn't by default


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
firefox


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
this?

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-F3EA8.png


[3/12/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i like it too


[3/12/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
would firefox take longer to emerge, or chromium


[3/12/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
chromium


[3/12/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/12/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
how fast is your flash speed


[3/12/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
on linux, mine is 10-15 mbps and on windows, 3-5 mbps


[3/12/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
for images


[3/12/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
(on windows, i use etcher, and on linux i use `dd`)


[3/12/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/12/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
depends


[3/12/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
around 10mbs


[3/12/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
not *mbps*


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
mbps means "megaBITS per second"


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
thus, not bytes


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
i see


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
it's how your ISP is lying to you


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
when it says that you have 400mbps speeds


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
you divide by 8


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
and in fact you only have 50 mb/s


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
50 mbs


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/12/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
you *can* open img files in archive managers, right


[3/12/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
i did that once in linux


[3/12/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
i think it was arch


[3/12/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-AB35E.png


[3/12/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
Nice


[3/12/2021 4:31 AM] tux_linux
I can't wait to see if I messed up or if it really works with other devices than mine


[3/12/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
👍 i cant wait to see if it works!


[3/12/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
be right back, grabbing my mini


[3/12/2021 4:32 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, suspends only works with the power button, but I'll issue an update file to fix that


[3/12/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill
and making sure i have the image of my mini


[3/12/2021 4:32 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/12/2021 4:33 AM] tux_linux
Also, exported storage is only 512mb, but it is enough for testing, I could change that in the future if necessary


[3/12/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
sorry for the wait, i had a little scare when i couldnt find my sd adapter


[3/12/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
all good now


[3/12/2021 4:35 AM] tux_linux
I completely understand


[3/12/2021 4:35 AM] tux_linux
I lose it all the time


[3/12/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
haha they *are* easy to lose


[3/12/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
The microsds are even easier to lose


[3/12/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
You just look away and they're already gone


[3/12/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
yeah its a miracle i havent lost mine


[3/12/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
"exported"?


[3/12/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
Onboard


[3/12/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
oh thats fine


[3/12/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
There's a few books for testing too


[3/12/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
oh nice


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
still just txt, right


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Well theoretically anything plain text


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Like shell scripts


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Or source code files


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
also i can resize the exported storage, right


[3/12/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
oh cool!


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
Not easily


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
It's actually... A file


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
i have a "partition wizard"


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
No


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
It's like Kobox chroot image but there are books inside instead of Xorg


[3/12/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
oh i see what you mean


[3/12/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
And so g_file_storage exports it over USB when you click go in usbms in Settings


[3/12/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
To exit of usbms, unplug the cable


[3/12/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
Did it flash?


[3/12/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
yup, just got the etcher notification


[3/12/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
Stress


[3/12/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
Suspense


[3/12/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
YEE


[3/12/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
eBook reader
InkBox


[3/12/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
IT WORKED


[3/12/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
Wheeeeeeeee


[3/12/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
Btw to open the file, double tap


[3/12/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/12/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
had a little confusion over where the open button was


[3/12/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
Yeah it's a strange scaling error


[3/12/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
same page error with the aura


[3/12/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
text seems to be below the screen as well


[3/12/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, did you click the menu button in the first page?


[3/12/2021 4:46 AM] the.mightydill
i opened the credits and it's cut off where it says "Thanks to:"


[3/12/2021 4:46 AM] the.mightydill
then the next page says "feedback."


[3/12/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
Yeah better to click menu after you turned one page


[3/12/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
Try it out it works


[3/12/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
:o
i see officeraction and i see "Elektron" on the bottom a little, but the menu is gone


[3/12/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
thanks for putting me in! :D


[3/12/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
Try with 84-0 it's Frankenstein


[3/12/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
Click next then menu


[3/12/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
That will work


[3/12/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
And well


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
how do i exit?


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
the "previous, next, and options" menu is gone


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
Well there's a home button in the menu


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
.


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
But... What?


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
Options menu?


[3/12/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
the page is showing fully on the screen


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
the menu on the bottom? for turning pages? that's gone


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
Oh


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
Force restart


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
wait i might send a picture, depending on if my camera works


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
It should work with Frankenstein tho


[3/12/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
camera is like 144p so no point in sending


[3/12/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, it's ok


[3/12/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
Did it reboot?


[3/12/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
yes, just fixing the back of the kobo


[3/12/2021 4:52 AM] tux_linux
Ok


[3/12/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
I feel your pain


[3/12/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
it works! and well!


[3/12/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
Nice! Did you try dictionary search?


[3/12/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
I think it's the fastest I've ever seen


[3/12/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
Double tap a word


[3/12/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
yeah definitely, i love it


[3/12/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
Nice! Also the star can save the word, then you can view them in apps/saved words


[3/12/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
This feature actually took a ton of time to develop


[3/12/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i saw, kind of like "my words" in nickel


[3/12/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
i can imagine


[3/12/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
Nice that you like it!


[3/12/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
whats the "light maps"? looks like "google maps"


[3/12/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
You can also try and plug it in to the computer, then settings/start usbms
And you'll have USB ms


[3/12/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
and i have no idea how to exit light maps


[3/12/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
Well it works but only with internet, so you'll either have to have USBnet set up or in the far future, wifi


[3/12/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/12/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
Exit, well yeah, no way currently


[3/12/2021 4:58 AM] tux_linux
Reboot


[3/12/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] tux_linux
Usbnet is started at boot time, so you can directly connect without having to hook up serial


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] tux_linux
It is stopped when in usbms though, of course


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] tux_linux
Did you try sleep?


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
i'll grab my usb


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, i like the screen


[3/12/2021 4:59 AM] the.mightydill
its simple


[3/12/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, and I'll issue a small update soon, you'll be able to see the update splash


[3/12/2021 5:00 AM] the.mightydill
wait...


[3/12/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
Yeah?


[3/12/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
its setting up an ethernet thing


[3/12/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
is that usbnet?


[3/12/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
But it probably won't cope well with Windows


[3/12/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
When you click "Go" on usbms, it will show as mass storage though


[3/12/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[3/12/2021 5:02 AM] the.mightydill
will i be able to see the files in onboard


[3/12/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/12/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
Well that's why there's usbms


[3/12/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill
haha dumb question


[3/12/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
Not the rootfs files though


[3/12/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
And that's better, because not secure otherwise


[3/12/2021 5:03 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
Should I create an MR thread?


[3/12/2021 5:04 AM] the.mightydill
YES


[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
I think it's mature enough now to be denoted as "usable"


[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
"Introducing InkBox

[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
agh caps


[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
Well a bit long tho


[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but not the title


[3/12/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
the header


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
"InkBox: an open source OS for Kobo eReaders"


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
Oh yeah sure


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] tux_linux
That's going to be huge


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
yeah!


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
no school tomorrow so that means i can be on


[3/12/2021 5:06 AM] the.mightydill
yey


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
Nice! Me it's online school so


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
About the same thing


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
i went online for 3 months, i decided in person was much better


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
We change between real classes and online


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] the.mightydill
high school?


[3/12/2021 5:07 AM] tux_linux
Like one day it's at school, and the other is home


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] the.mightydill
i'm in junior high


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
Honestly I don't know much what you're talking about


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
Here in Quebec I'm in "Secondaire 3"


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] the.mightydill
middle school i guess you could call it


[3/12/2021 5:08 AM] the.mightydill
grade 7


[3/12/2021 5:09 AM] tux_linux
Ok so like maybe "Secondaire 1" here


[3/12/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:09 AM] the.mightydill
probably


[3/12/2021 5:10 AM] the.mightydill
do i need to eject


[3/12/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
Well, better to


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
Anyways it reboots after because I didn't figure out a way to do it without reboot


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
doesnt seem to be an option, its reading it as a native disk (i.e. part of C:)


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
nevermind im dumb


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, impossible


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] the.mightydill
it has happened before


[3/12/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
Wait really


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but for disks like DVDs, not USB devices


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
Still strange


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
You have to unplug after


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i did


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
Did it reboot?


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
(yet)


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/12/2021 5:12 AM] the.mightydill
im reading sherlock holmes


[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
Huh?


[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
Ok so it rebooted but you didn't realize it


[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
probably


[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
Haha ok


[3/12/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux

Also, if you want to change the font size, there's an option in settings for that


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
No


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i generally like small text


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
im a big reader


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
There's an option to change number of words


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
i'll go get a better camera


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
oh nice!


[3/12/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
Great


[3/12/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, because bigger font size would be ... Problematic if that didn't exist


[3/12/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
much better

I hope people will like it


[3/12/2021 5:20 AM] the.mightydill
they will


[3/12/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
I think I made a good job in the design


[3/12/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux

[3/12/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but so many formats


[3/12/2021 5:24 AM] tux_linux
I didn't code this one

thats cool


[3/12/2021 5:24 AM] the.mightydill

You can change the pencil size btw


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
yeah thats what i did


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
Yeah of course


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
I also shot a video


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
i can do that but there might be noise


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] the.mightydill
i can mute that however


[3/12/2021 5:26 AM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/12/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
...hard to do with a webcam perched on a laptop


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
Ok well that's very nice that you like it,  tomorrow I'll issue some new updates so you can see what it's like to update, and also it will introduce a fix to suspend with the suspend button in the quit menu


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
Well I did one with my phone, the quality should be better


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
Not that I don't like your webcam but


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
no, i understand


[3/12/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
phones are better for videos


[3/12/2021 5:29 AM] the.mightydill
i took the pictures of my laptop with a phone actually


[3/12/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, difference is noticeable


[3/12/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
Haha


[3/12/2021 5:29 AM] tux_linux
You could take a video with the phone if you want too


[3/12/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but not right now; it's being used :/


[3/12/2021 5:30 AM] the.mightydill

how do i disable again?


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
You'll need to reflash I'm afraid


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok no problem


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
Or modify the config


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
how do i do that?


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
In /opt/config


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
You'll have to do that on the microSD tho


[3/12/2021 5:33 AM] tux_linux
With a real computer


[3/12/2021 5:34 AM] the.mightydill
thats fine im on a real computer


[3/12/2021 5:34 AM] the.mightydill
also i like how fast IB loads


[3/12/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
But can you access ext4 FS?


[3/12/2021 5:34 AM] the.mightydill
no idea lets see


[3/12/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, actually the boot process mounts squashfs images everywhere


[3/12/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
You shouldn't be able to on Windows


[3/12/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
Like, InkBox binary is a squashfs, Python, qt, etc.


[3/12/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
my microSD was RIGHT HERE


[3/12/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
AAAAAH


[3/12/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
ok i feel your pain


[3/12/2021 5:36 AM] tux_linux
Well is it not in the Kobo?


[3/12/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
just took it out


[3/12/2021 5:36 AM] tux_linux
No squashfs is nice
You can check /etc/init.d/inkbox_gui


[3/12/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
found it


[3/12/2021 5:36 AM] tux_linux
Oof


[3/12/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
now lets see if it can work


[3/12/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
Probably not


[3/12/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
nope


[3/12/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
oof


[3/12/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 4:29 PM] tux_linux
so you'll click the update button in settings


[3/12/2021 4:30 PM] tux_linux
turn the page theres a chevron


[3/12/2021 4:30 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 4:30 PM] tux_linux
pointing right


[3/12/2021 4:30 PM] the.mightydill
i'll also take a picture of that


[3/12/2021 4:30 PM] tux_linux
nice


[3/12/2021 4:31 PM] tux_linux
did you find it?


[3/12/2021 4:32 PM] the.mightydill
wow!!

[3/12/2021 4:32 PM] tux_linux
yeah, do you like the animation?


[3/12/2021 4:32 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:33 PM] the.mightydill
just like nickel


[3/12/2021 4:33 PM] the.mightydill
success

[3/12/2021 4:33 PM] tux_linux
yeah, nice


[3/12/2021 4:34 PM] the.mightydill
now i'll look at the youtube, havent had a chance to see that


[3/12/2021 4:34 PM] the.mightydill
i saw the thread


[3/12/2021 4:34 PM] tux_linux
you should be able to suspend by clicking the suspend button in quit menu


[3/12/2021 4:37 PM] the.mightydill
its not responding...


[3/12/2021 4:37 PM] the.mightydill
to touch


[3/12/2021 4:37 PM] the.mightydill
wait nevermind, i think it was frozen for a minute


[3/12/2021 4:37 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/12/2021 4:38 PM] the.mightydill
^


[3/12/2021 4:38 PM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[3/12/2021 4:39 PM] the.mightydill
i really want to see if my grub reinstall worked for showing the other distros


[3/12/2021 4:39 PM] the.mightydill
but i cant because of chromium


[3/12/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
wait


[3/12/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
you wanted to compile chromium


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux
i said you should go with falkon


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux
but you didn't listen


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i may have forgotten


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
:/ sorry


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux
but it will finish someday


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
also touch is being wonky


[3/12/2021 4:41 PM] tux_linux
restart?


[3/12/2021 4:41 PM] tux_linux
how wonky


[3/12/2021 4:41 PM] the.mightydill
i press options and previous and it turns the page


[3/12/2021 4:41 PM] tux_linux
huh restart


[3/12/2021 4:42 PM] the.mightydill
it seems to not respond when i press quit


[3/12/2021 4:42 PM] tux_linux
force restart then


[3/12/2021 4:42 PM] the.mightydill
doing it


[3/12/2021 4:42 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok now i see the quit mennu


[3/12/2021 4:42 PM] the.mightydill
i like it


[3/12/2021 4:43 PM] tux_linux
but try what you were doing before


[3/12/2021 4:43 PM] tux_linux
when did it become wonky


[3/12/2021 4:43 PM] the.mightydill
which one was huckleberry finn? 76-0 or 84-0?


[3/12/2021 4:43 PM] tux_linux
76


[3/12/2021 4:44 PM] the.mightydill
working now


[3/12/2021 4:44 PM] tux_linux
does suspend with the button works?


[3/12/2021 4:45 PM] the.mightydill
lets see


[3/12/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
brb


[3/12/2021 4:46 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/12/2021 4:51 PM] the.mightydill
ok back


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
what does "search" do


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] tux_linux
nothing for now


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] tux_linux
it should search onboard for books in the future


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] tux_linux
and maybe dictionary too


[3/12/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/12/2021 4:53 PM] the.mightydill
personally i think the config file should be onboard


[3/12/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
that would render updating ... difficult i think


[3/12/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
i could implement a reset option


[3/12/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
like the "diags" menu in the kindles


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] the.mightydill
hm


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] the.mightydill
never had a kindle


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] tux_linux
these are... nice but not nice


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] the.mightydill
factory reset to default inkbox?


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:55 PM] tux_linux
that'd be cool


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
like a recovery partition


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] the.mightydill
^


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] the.mightydill
i have the space for that


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
that's exciting i must admit


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] the.mightydill
definitely


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] the.mightydill
inkbox can become like koreader and plato


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
I could also roll another update today because I need some way to put files directly in the rootfs


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
maybe more stable too, because qt is rock solid stable already


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] the.mightydill
yeah!


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] the.mightydill
also why cant i switch ttys while running KDE without KDE crashing


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] tux_linux
it's specific to distros


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] tux_linux
arch can


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] tux_linux
others can't


[3/12/2021 4:57 PM] tux_linux
well right out of the box tho


[3/12/2021 4:58 PM] the.mightydill
tty1 is compiling, tty2 is kde, i switch to tty1 to check on it, then back to tty2, to find that `bluedevil` is printing out a dozen error messages a minute and i have to `^C`


[3/12/2021 4:58 PM] tux_linux
tty2 is on KDE ????????????


[3/12/2021 4:58 PM] tux_linux
well that's SIGNIFICANTLY slowing down your compiling


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
no tty1 is on compiling


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
tty2 is kde


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
but yeah i'll avoid that


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] tux_linux
yeah, better to close the x session


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] tux_linux
tty 3 and killall X


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] tux_linux
or rc-service sddm stop maybe


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
no if i switch ttys then the thing crashes by itself


[3/12/2021 4:59 PM] the.mightydill
not sddm


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] the.mightydill
`startx`


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] tux_linux
killall X then


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] tux_linux
or log out but i don't know if it will really kill x


[3/12/2021 5:00 PM] the.mightydill
i'll do it from konsole


[3/12/2021 5:01 PM] the.mightydill
also i'll put some screenshots on MR


[3/12/2021 5:01 PM] tux_linux
ok nice


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] the.mightydill
request dhcp lease?


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] the.mightydill
what's that for?


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] tux_linux
for usbnet


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] tux_linux
when you want to bridge and have internet access via usb


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/12/2021 5:06 PM] the.mightydill
ok so i'll restart and plug the mini into the computer


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
then i'll request a dhcp lease?


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
what computer


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
laptop windows 10


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
windows? no


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
aw


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
plug it in the gentoo laptop, then tty2 or tty3


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
you wont eat cpu


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] the.mightydill
so i plug it in then request a dhcp lease?


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/12/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
you plug it in


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
`ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.2`


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
and then


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
`ssh user@192.168.2.1`


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
password is `user`


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
you won't have internet access, but it's enough to have a shell


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
real internet access is a bit more complicated


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] the.mightydill
shouldnt it be 192.168.2.2 not 192.168.2.1


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/12/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
because your computer is 192.168.2.1

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/12/2021 5:09 PM] tux_linux
and the kobo is 192.168.2.2


[3/12/2021 5:09 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:09 PM] tux_linux
then you'll want to gain root access , password is `root`


[3/12/2021 5:09 PM] tux_linux
i may or may not disable root login in the future, to make things more secure


[3/12/2021 5:09 PM] tux_linux
ssh as root is already blocked by alpine


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
you can start and stop inkbox by typing
`rc-service inkbox_gui start`


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
or stop


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] the.mightydill
`usb0` isnt an interface


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
also i made a shortcut, you can type `start inkbox_gui` as well


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
usb0?


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/12/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig


[3/12/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
does it show any unusual interface


[3/12/2021 5:13 PM] the.mightydill
no just `enp5s0` and `lo`


[3/12/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
disconnect usb


[3/12/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
reboot the kobo


[3/12/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
reconnect usb


[3/12/2021 5:13 PM] tux_linux
or maybe `ifconfig -a` shows something else


[3/12/2021 5:15 PM] the.mightydill
`sit0`


[3/12/2021 5:16 PM] tux_linux
ok so try disconnect reboot and reconnect then


[3/12/2021 5:18 PM] the.mightydill
i set the thing to 192.168.2.2 and started ssh


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
does it work


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
but `ssh user@192.128.2.1` just hangs


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
.2


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
i said


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-3CBC0.png


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
and you set it to 192.168.2.1


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
really i said that?


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
hahahahaha ok it's the contrary


[3/12/2021 5:20 PM] the.mightydill
hehe


[3/12/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig .1


[3/12/2021 5:20 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
ssh .2


[3/12/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
so `ifsonfig 192.168.2.1` then `ssh user@192.168.2.2`


[3/12/2021 5:21 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
connection  timed out


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig usb0 down


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
unplug


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
reboot


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
plug


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig usb0 up


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
ssh user@192.168.2.2


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] the.mightydill
you mean sit0 but ye


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
not sit0


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] the.mightydill
what


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] the.mightydill
ok then


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
there should be some interface


[3/12/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
enx..... or usb...


[3/12/2021 5:23 PM] the.mightydill
theres lo and enp5s0 which are regular, but then there's sit0 that appears when i plug it in


[3/12/2021 5:23 PM] tux_linux
really


[3/12/2021 5:23 PM] tux_linux
try another usb port


[3/12/2021 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
wait sit0 is apparently part of the system as well


[3/12/2021 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
it only shows up when i use `-a`


[3/12/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux
try another usb port


[3/12/2021 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
wait i only have 2 and i tried both and it doesnt work


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
strange


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
boot win10 laptop with a liveusb


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
cant


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] the.mightydill
my parents dont want me to :c


[3/12/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
even a liveusb?


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
this is a "family" computer even though theres a fast pc in the corner


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
it doesnt do anything


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
still :c


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
yeah ok don't know then


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
you rebooted the kobo?


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/12/2021 5:29 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/12/2021 5:31 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/12/2021 5:31 PM] tux_linux
plug in the kobo then


[3/12/2021 5:31 PM] tux_linux
`dmesg | tail`


[3/12/2021 5:33 PM] the.mightydill
it seems to recognize it


[3/12/2021 5:33 PM] tux_linux
what does it say


[3/12/2021 5:33 PM] the.mightydill
it says "new usb connect" and it gives info


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] the.mightydill
"product: ethernet rndis gadget" or something


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] tux_linux
should be ok


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] the.mightydill
hm


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] the.mightydill
its not tho


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] tux_linux
are you sure it doesnt show anything else in ifconfig


[3/12/2021 5:34 PM] the.mightydill
lets try again


[3/12/2021 5:35 PM] the.mightydill
ye im sure


[3/12/2021 5:36 PM] tux_linux
ifconfig usb0 up ?


[3/12/2021 5:36 PM] tux_linux
maybe ...


[3/12/2021 5:36 PM] the.mightydill
ok lets see


[3/12/2021 5:36 PM] the.mightydill
no such device


[3/12/2021 5:40 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/12/2021 5:46 PM] the.mightydill
ok no problem


[3/12/2021 5:53 PM] tux_linux
well maybe you could try to let the kobo plugged in, then reboot the kobo


[3/12/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
and don't unplug it


[3/12/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
the only option left would be to restart the computer but obviously you can't


[3/12/2021 8:53 PM] tux_linux
ok I've looked into some options for a recovery partition, I think I'll embed an initramfs into a new kernel and then switch_root to either the rootfs or recoveryfs if the power button is pressed or not in the first 3 seconds of boot-up


[3/12/2021 10:44 PM] the.mightydill
Great!!!


[3/12/2021 10:44 PM] the.mightydill
Initramfs would be very useful


[3/12/2021 10:44 PM] tux_linux
yeah, actually wonderfully useful for emmc devices


[3/12/2021 10:45 PM] the.mightydill
But I think you should put it in the thread in bold, otherwise people might accidentally recover their Inkbox by accident


[3/12/2021 10:46 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/12/2021 10:46 PM] tux_linux
well if they get to the recovery menu there will still be options


[3/12/2021 10:46 PM] tux_linux
it won't erase anything right away


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] the.mightydill
Oh I thought it would


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] tux_linux
look at the kindles diags


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] the.mightydill
Like nickel


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] the.mightydill
Ok


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] the.mightydill
Diagnostics?


[3/12/2021 10:47 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/12/2021 10:48 PM] the.mightydill
Oh cool


[3/12/2021 10:48 PM] tux_linux
that, as an example

[3/12/2021 10:49 PM] tux_linux
yeah, a cool menu


[3/12/2021 10:49 PM] tux_linux
I'm wondering if I should do it in Qt or in something lighter


[3/12/2021 10:49 PM] tux_linux
but I couldn't, since I don't know much else


[3/12/2021 10:49 PM] tux_linux
and even if i did, touch input would be a chore to handle without qt


[3/12/2021 10:49 PM] the.mightydill
Lighter imo but it's up to you


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah true


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] tux_linux
maybe xorg haha


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] tux_linux
but I think it would weigh about the same size


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] tux_linux
also, I can put Qt in a squashfs too so that's not bad


[3/12/2021 10:50 PM] the.mightydill
Which reminds me, chromium is more than halfway done


[3/12/2021 10:51 PM] the.mightydill
Oh ye


[3/12/2021 10:51 PM] tux_linux
basically, the initrd will just switch root to the diags partition if the power button is pressed


[3/12/2021 10:51 PM] tux_linux
otherwise it'll switch root to the rootfs


[3/12/2021 10:51 PM] tux_linux
nice!

[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] the.mightydill
Ok then that's much better than nickels way of doing things


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] tux_linux
yep


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] tux_linux
kindles don't have a factory reset option like kobos


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] the.mightydill
Really


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] the.mightydill
Weird


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] tux_linux
to reinstall the fw you have to hook it up to serial then you go in fastboot and transfer manually the fw images


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] the.mightydill
That's sad


[3/12/2021 10:52 PM] tux_linux
no not weird; amazon just likes to lock their users into their ecosystem


[3/12/2021 10:53 PM] the.mightydill
I'm on an Amazon fire right now ;p


[3/12/2021 10:53 PM] tux_linux
yes, but I love it; it's nice to see what amount of efforts they've deployed to lockdown the system like this


[3/12/2021 10:53 PM] tux_linux
if InkBox was closed source and we sold it in real ereaders, I think I would do that


[3/12/2021 10:53 PM] tux_linux
but it's my point of view


[3/12/2021 10:54 PM] tux_linux
I like to lock down things; but i don't know why


[3/12/2021 10:54 PM] the.mightydill
Hhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjhhhfv


[3/12/2021 10:54 PM] the.mightydill
Wait what


[3/12/2021 10:54 PM] tux_linux
and then i'd watch bulletin boards to see if someone found how to jailbreak them


[3/12/2021 10:54 PM] the.mightydill
"Hm" auto corrected to Hhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjhhhfv


[3/12/2021 10:55 PM] tux_linux
and I'd probably hire the "someone"


[3/12/2021 10:55 PM] the.mightydill
Looool


[3/12/2021 10:55 PM] tux_linux
haha


[3/12/2021 10:57 PM] the.mightydill
Might even be possible... In the extremely far future


[3/12/2021 10:57 PM] tux_linux
probably not


[3/12/2021 10:57 PM] tux_linux
it's too crappy to be a real product


[3/12/2021 10:57 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah since it's open source right now


[3/12/2021 10:57 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah but like you said it's still " alpha"


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
yeah, it will probably be a reactos-like alpha


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
haha


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
20 years


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
that's a long time


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] the.mightydill
haha you'll be 35 and I'll be 32


[3/12/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
yep


[3/12/2021 10:59 PM] tux_linux
but if we continue the development that far


[3/12/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
yeah ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯


[3/12/2021 10:59 PM] tux_linux
well it has to be good


[3/12/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
Yeap


[3/12/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
Definitely


[3/12/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
what I would have done for the diags would be just to have put some things in mmcblk0p2
but since the mini's reset button doesn't restart on mmcblk0p2


[3/12/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
we go the hard way


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] the.mightydill

[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] the.mightydill
Yep


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] tux_linux
yeah; do you show that to your friends sometimes?


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] tux_linux
they must be scared haha


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] the.mightydill
But we should also expand to more device aupport


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] the.mightydill
Support


[3/12/2021 11:01 PM] tux_linux
ofc


[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] tux_linux
but the only other thing i have with removable sd is the glo hd


[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] tux_linux
and as you know...


[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] tux_linux
it's a piece of crap


[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] the.mightydill
Hahaha yea, one of them asked me to spawn three trillion dollars in USD


[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] tux_linux
they're hilarious

[3/12/2021 11:02 PM] the.mightydill
Ye I've seen pictures


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
They are


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
well mine is


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
not them


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
i mean; the screen


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
it got cracked


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
I saw


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
you uploaded a video I think


[3/12/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
yeah the youtube thing


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
It looked old


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
it's only from 2015


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
I got my aura in 2019 or something


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
but it looks old because I dismantled it from its shell


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
Oh


[3/12/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
honestly, I don't really care about it


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
the aura could work too, maybe booting from an external sd, but the h/w is pretty much the same than on the mini


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
haha my Kobo mini is always lying around


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
good thing


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
No it's pretty recent 
Not an Aura, an Aura H2O ed 2


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
no I mean my Aura


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
No sd slot


[3/12/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
Oh


[3/12/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah but the thing is, how would you boot from an external one in the first place


[3/12/2021 11:06 PM] tux_linux
tweaking uboot config


[3/12/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
Ooh us


[3/12/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill
Oh ye*

Aura H2O Boot from external SD Kobo Developer's Corner


[3/12/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
hmm well it's the wrong one


[3/12/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
maybe not


[3/12/2021 11:07 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/12/2021 11:07 PM] the.mightydill
probably the same with every kobo


[3/12/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
should work yes


[3/12/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
Because yeah I thought nickel was the one detecting the SDs not uboot


[3/12/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
of course not


[3/12/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
u-boot is like grub


[3/12/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
Oh


[3/12/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
it's extremely low-level and it loads kernel at specific memory addresses, then boot


[3/12/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
Brb checking on laptop


[3/12/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
Oh ok I get it

13078 out of 23398


[3/12/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
:\


[3/12/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
two days to go


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
i think


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
More like one


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
depends


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
and you don't know what can happen at the end


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
Maybe even tomorrow morning


[3/12/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
Yea


[3/12/2021 11:11 PM] the.mightydill
Laptop is surprisingly fast


[3/12/2021 11:11 PM] tux_linux
it's the final link that is the most likely to fail


[3/12/2021 11:12 PM] tux_linux
it will probably eat up a lot of memory, don't know if your swap will be enough


[3/12/2021 11:12 PM] the.mightydill
14G swap, man


[3/12/2021 11:12 PM] tux_linux
yeah i know


[3/12/2021 11:12 PM] the.mightydill
Oh dang


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] the.mightydill
18G will have to be in memory???


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] tux_linux
but surely a lot


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] tux_linux
i think you should be good


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] tux_linux
but short


[3/12/2021 11:13 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah but surely not that much


[3/12/2021 11:15 PM] tux_linux
Also I think I'll do some OOBE setup for InkBox


[3/12/2021 11:16 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah like basic config setup?


[3/12/2021 11:16 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/12/2021 11:16 PM] tux_linux
Like when you boot Nickel for the first time


[3/12/2021 11:17 PM] the.mightydill
Oh cool, so maybe in the future different languages


[3/12/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/12/2021 11:17 PM] the.mightydill
Could start with English and French


[3/12/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
Yep


[3/12/2021 11:17 PM] the.mightydill
would definitely be cool


[3/12/2021 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Just had a flash
Imagine in the future people sell modded Kobos with InkBox
Like factory reset and there's a "press the power button"picture and it boots into InkBox


[3/12/2021 11:21 PM] the.mightydill
hahaha yeah


[3/12/2021 11:22 PM] the.mightydill
Could also look into developing with kindles now that you have one


[3/12/2021 11:25 PM] tux_linux
That's going to be tricky


[3/12/2021 11:25 PM] tux_linux
Because I'd have to port the Kobo platform plugin


[3/12/2021 11:25 PM] the.mightydill
"that looks like a virus"


[3/12/2021 11:26 PM] the.mightydill
Oh yeah


[3/12/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux
nice haha


[3/13/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
also, a NickelBoot in Qt would be nice
what should I do first? NickelBoot shouldn't take much time; it's not that complicated to set up I think


[3/13/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
I can't believe how much I learned in 3 weeks hahaha


[3/13/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
that was... the firmware thing, right?


[3/13/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/13/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
to boot multiple nickel versions


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
thats the reason why i installed linux *haha*


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
*true*


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
well you'll be able to test it


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
i think you don't regret your decision


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
ye i dont


[3/13/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
windows was crap


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
i'm testing things with an initrd, kernel doesn't want to cooperate


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
ofc


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
`kexec`?


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
initramfs


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
initrd


[3/13/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
dont know what an initrd is


[3/13/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
pretty much the same thing


[3/13/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
gotta go, will be back in ~20 mins


[3/13/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/13/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/13/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
ok bye


[3/13/2021 4:46 AM] the.mightydill
back


[3/13/2021 4:47 AM] tux_linux
no one seems to be interested by inkbox on mobileread tho...


[3/13/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
no they will be


[3/13/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
wait let me see mr


[3/13/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
they probably didnt see the thread


[3/13/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
or didnt reply


[3/13/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
because it only has 258 views


[3/13/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/13/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
people like @davidfor and @NiLuJe are probably asleep


[3/13/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
maybe


[3/13/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
ye because theyre in different timezones... davidfor is in australia and NiLuJe is in france


[3/13/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
yes, could be


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
...chromium will probably be installed


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
by


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
tomorrow morning at the latest i think


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
earliest*


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] tux_linux
great


[3/13/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill
and i probably wont stop using the word probably


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
I use Gentoo btw


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
that?


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
say it to your friends, they won't understand anything of it


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
well likely


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
how about "I use Deepin, Arch, Gentoo, and Debian btw"


[3/13/2021 4:53 AM] tux_linux
yeah... maybe


[3/13/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
they would say "are you crazy"


[3/13/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
"and I run Alpine Linux on my Kobo"


[3/13/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
hahaha


[3/13/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
so "I use Alpine, Deepin, Arch, Debian, and Gentoo btw"


[3/13/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
wait i'll put that in my chat right now


[3/13/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
i'll do @all in my chat to annoy people as well C:<

[3/13/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
*smacks forehead*


[3/13/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
i forgot to `swapon`


[3/13/2021 5:13 AM] the.mightydill
im so dumb haha


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
the compiling was stuck


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
it failed?


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
it was stuck, i `top` and i see 0 swap


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
haha


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] the.mightydill
so i think "I FORGOT TO SWAPON"


[3/13/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
and you put that in your class group chat again haha


[3/13/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
and i almost destroy my computer punching in `swapon /dev/sda6`


[3/13/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
yeeeeee


[3/13/2021 5:15 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
well hopefully it will finish soon


[3/13/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
yeah now that swap is on


[3/13/2021 5:16 AM] the.mightydill
will `top` use cpu or slow down compiling


[3/13/2021 5:16 AM] tux_linux
yes, and you should look at htop too, it's nice


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
htop isnt a command :/


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
emerge it


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
later


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
after chromium


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
or download it


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
https://htop.dev/downloads.html


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
then put the binary in /usr/bin


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
WAIT i just realized, after chromium, i no longer need to `emerge`


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] tux_linux
why


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
because i can just download the tar.gz


[3/13/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
unless im dumb


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
which is often


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
well not for each app


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
yeah only for the ones that allow it


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] the.mightydill
like discord


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
also, i think that gentoo sometimes offers `package-bin` packages


[3/13/2021 5:18 AM] tux_linux
like, when compiling is so slow that even the maintainers would like to throw their computer by the window


[3/13/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
like me


[3/13/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
with chromium


[3/13/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/13/2021 5:19 AM] tux_linux
but some are worse


[3/13/2021 5:19 AM] the.mightydill
like?


[3/13/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
well, not necessarily by compile time (there are, i can't name one for now), but e.g. Linux From Scratch


[3/13/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
you have to hunt for the depends, one by one


[3/13/2021 5:20 AM] tux_linux
that's what you call a d*** big rabbit hole


[3/13/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
*thinks at what the experience of compiling Qt in LFS was*


[3/13/2021 5:21 AM] tux_linux
gentoo does all of that for you


[3/13/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 5:21 AM] the.mightydill
yikes

hahahahaa


[3/13/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
i'd never say that to anyone, so you're coureagous


[3/13/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
well except the bit when you say that windows is crap


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
initrd is ALMOST working


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
like, I got to the point where I can get a login console


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
whats going wrong?


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] the.mightydill
oh cool!!


[3/13/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
i don't have a password set


[3/13/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill
oh easy


[3/13/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
and an initrd is not supposed to have a password


[3/13/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
yeah i know


[3/13/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
i'm trying some getty tricks currently


[3/13/2021 5:28 AM] the.mightydill

You just lost them


[3/13/2021 3:36 PM] tux_linux
Btw initrd is working


[3/13/2021 3:42 PM] the.mightydill
cool!


[3/13/2021 3:42 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/13/2021 3:44 PM] tux_linux
You lost me as well


[3/13/2021 3:45 PM] tux_linux
Well idk if it is an expression where you are


[3/13/2021 3:49 PM] tux_linux
btw what platform do you use to talk to them? I can't recognize it


[3/13/2021 4:06 PM] the.mightydill
google chat


[3/13/2021 4:06 PM] the.mightydill
like google hangouts, but for school accounts


[3/13/2021 4:06 PM] the.mightydill
what do you mean?


[3/13/2021 4:06 PM] the.mightydill
what expression


[3/13/2021 4:14 PM] the.mightydill
also i expect chromium to finish by tomorrow morning :/


[3/13/2021 4:26 PM] tux_linux
haha you can never be sure


[3/13/2021 4:26 PM] tux_linux
"you lost me"


[3/13/2021 4:27 PM] tux_linux

https://download-chromium.appspot.com/
Download Chromium
The easiest way to download Chromium


[3/13/2021 4:27 PM] tux_linux
that, though, are unstable versions, daily snapshots


[3/13/2021 4:27 PM] tux_linux
so it's better to wait for the compilation to finish


[3/13/2021 4:51 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/13/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
wheeeee
initrd works, and it works very well


[3/13/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
like, i successfully created a script that "boots" openrc from a chroot in the initrd


[3/13/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
and it works flawlessly


[3/13/2021 5:46 PM] tux_linux
now, we only have to set up a listener to power button events and we'll be able to set the boot partition according to it


[3/13/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
yay


[3/13/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
can you give me a disk image? i'd like to try it


[3/13/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
well


[3/13/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
you won't see anything different without a serial port


[3/13/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
for now it just boots as usual


[3/13/2021 5:51 PM] tux_linux
because I didn't create a recovery partition yet


[3/13/2021 5:51 PM] tux_linux
right now I'm testing if update is still working correctly


[3/13/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
oh i see


[3/13/2021 10:42 PM] the.mightydill
compiling seems to have slowed down


[3/13/2021 10:42 PM] the.mightydill
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/13/2021 10:42 PM] tux_linux
it's life

It's going to be a long time, maybe even until Tuesday


[3/13/2021 10:50 PM] tux_linux
possible


[3/13/2021 10:50 PM] the.mightydill
Especially since it slowed down


[3/13/2021 11:37 PM] the.mightydill

nothing moves?


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
nothing moves


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
it was stuck, so i used top, and then closed it


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
you can't type anything in


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
ye i cant


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
it's top


[3/14/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
the cpu was already at its highest usage but top hit the limit


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
oh no


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
so how do i fix it


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] tux_linux
well; you reboot and you retry


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
...ok i wont do chromium


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
im doing falkon


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] tux_linux
maybe it will restart where it left


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] tux_linux
maybe not


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
and *download* chromium


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/14/2021 1:22 AM] the.mightydill

[3/14/2021 2:36 AM] the.mightydill
had to force a reboot


[3/14/2021 3:45 AM] tux_linux

[3/14/2021 3:15 PM] the.mightydill
btw qtwebengine hates me and doesnt want to merge


[3/14/2021 3:15 PM] the.mightydill
so falkon died


[3/14/2021 3:15 PM] the.mightydill
i'll try to emerge chromium again


[3/14/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
*nope* :/


[3/14/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
emerging firefox


[3/14/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
that will cost you a lot of time too


[3/14/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
but well
it works at the end (at least for me)


[3/14/2021 5:23 PM] the.mightydill
hm


[3/14/2021 5:23 PM] the.mightydill
well its the only way i guess


[3/14/2021 5:24 PM] tux_linux
i'll roll out a new update for inkbox soon
would you like to try it?


[3/14/2021 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
yes!


[3/14/2021 5:37 PM] tux_linux

[3/14/2021 5:53 PM] the.mightydill
.adds, right?


[3/14/2021 5:56 PM] tux_linux

[3/14/2021 6:05 PM] tux_linux
yeah... maybe


[3/14/2021 6:05 PM] tux_linux
but there's limited space on the server


[3/14/2021 6:06 PM] the.mightydill
oh yeah


[3/14/2021 6:06 PM] the.mightydill
hmmm


[3/14/2021 6:06 PM] the.mightydill
maybe instead of direct links, you could link to a google drive file


[3/14/2021 6:06 PM] tux_linux
why?


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
fermino was kind enough to donate some of his server space; why not use it? 😉


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] the.mightydill
because drive links wouldnt take space :p


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] the.mightydill
yeah maybe the latest update could be a direct download


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
hmm yeah... but it's harder to manage


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/14/2021 6:07 PM] tux_linux
with that i can just connect with ftp and put the files

[3/15/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill

[3/15/2021 12:59 AM] tux_linux
yeah, the random module didn't exist, and we could have had issues with it if I didn't knew

Port forward your IP and vnc to your computer

Or search for a free web proxy website, they are everywhere

[3/15/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/15/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
also if you press ctrl+alt+t on the chromebook and type "shell", is it showing ... something?


[3/15/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
i know about crosh


[3/15/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
well, there's probably an extension for vnc


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
yeah, does shell access work, or is it blocked?


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
ye but 99.99% sure its blocked by my admin


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
only crosh works


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
try it still


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
not terminal


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/15/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill

[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux

[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux

[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux

[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
it was removed


[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill

[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux
what sysadmins would think a random student would like to access ssh


[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill
and the extension is... blocked ofc


[3/15/2021 11:10 PM] the.mightydill

[3/16/2021 12:03 AM] tux_linux

[3/16/2021 12:03 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/16/2021 12:03 AM] tux_linux

[3/16/2021 12:03 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/16/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux

[3/16/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux

What's wrong with always being root?
I have a feeling this is a stupid question, but this is something I've wondered for awhile.

I have a VPS and this is my first big linux venture. I am the only person who has access to it. My quest...

quick update on inkbox status: things are progressing, I've had a lot of problems with usb storage lately, but now it's (hopefully) all solved. Restore mechanism is fully working. Next step: continue with the diags partition, add some new options, then lock down the main rootfs so it can't be accessed by anyone unless he goes enabling access in diags. also, root login will be disabled and ssh too in the default image, to prevent hacking and bla bla
tho, you'll always be able to re-activate that by going into diags, but by doing a full factory reset (safety mesure)


[3/19/2021 3:33 AM] the.mightydill
cooool


[3/19/2021 3:33 AM] tux_linux

do you use inkbox sometimes since you installed it on your kobo (not to judge you, but just to see how crap it is and how much I have to do before it'd be like usable)

yeah actually


[3/19/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
nice


[3/19/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
use, like read or just explore?


[3/19/2021 3:38 AM] the.mightydill
for it to be usable, i'd say a library page instead of a reader button


[3/19/2021 3:38 AM] the.mightydill
both

huh? what? isn't that what I already did with recent books?

[3/19/2021 3:40 AM] tux_linux
but... it'll be beautiful once it is done


[3/19/2021 3:40 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but no matter how clueless i am about qt, i'll help


[3/19/2021 3:40 AM] the.mightydill
:p


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
well; what do you prefer UI-wise between Nickel, KoReader and Plato? (UI, like general design)
I'd say Plato has the best UI I have ever seen on an eReader
but I think InkBox isn't that bad


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
yeah plato is really good


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
i agree, inkbox isnt that bad


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
what should I improve?


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
hmmm tough


[3/19/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
(apart from Night Mode, which I'm trying to find an easy way to do)


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
i'd say a different ui font, and layout difference


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
different UI font?


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
I chose Inter, because it was modern


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
and beautiful


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
...no?


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
yea its good


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
wait let me grab my mini


[3/19/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/19/2021 3:43 AM] the.mightydill
hmm maybe put the date next to the time


[3/19/2021 3:43 AM] tux_linux
Well, ok. But what should go at the empty place?


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] the.mightydill
-inkbox-


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] the.mightydill
or -welcome to inkbox-


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] tux_linux
not with the dashes tho


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] tux_linux
if it's at the left, it won't make sense


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] tux_linux
but yea, maybe


[3/19/2021 3:44 AM] the.mightydill
hmm ye it wont make sense


[3/19/2021 3:45 AM] tux_linux
you mean a layout like in the reader widget, when you open the Options menu?


[3/19/2021 3:45 AM] the.mightydill
also, i opened credits twice, and its showing up twice on home


[3/19/2021 3:45 AM] tux_linux
possible


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
did you enter an usbms session before? or did you force-shutdown inkbox?


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
usbms i believe


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
yeah... maybe


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
but should not do that


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
idk


[3/19/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
wait it says "books" not "recently read books"


[3/19/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
There's the code snippet that does that job

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-B804B.txt


[3/19/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, well I thought I'd put that. Should I change it with "Recently read books?"


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
nah this is better


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
ok nice


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
did you update to latest 0.1.1?


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
well, here latest is more of 0.1.2, with all of the drastical changes that I made to the rootfs and sd


[3/19/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
i think


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
you can go in "Settings", then "About", and you should see the version


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
that's a thing I added in 0.1.1


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
0.1.1-alpha


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/19/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
so ye


[3/19/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
a new sd image will be mandatory for 0.1.2
like I added two partitions and an initrd


[3/19/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
it's a tri-boot system


[3/19/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
was just about to ask that hahahaa


[3/19/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
initrd? must have been tough


[3/19/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
Boot sequence basically
U-Boot -> Kernel -> initrd -> rootfs or recoveryfs


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
yes, it was ... not that easy


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
then again, inkbox isnt easy either


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
no, neither


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
also can you run inkbox on a computer? if it runs on alpine


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] the.mightydill
really?!


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
but... well in an app


[3/19/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
in X


[3/19/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
still cool


[3/19/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
and the functionnality is pretty limited since your typical Linux PC doesn't have a rootfs like Kobo's one


[3/19/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
hm yeah that's true


[3/19/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
actually, to go in Inkbox, there's some more steps. Since Alpine is musl, Qt needed glibc so I needed to push it another step further. I built a rootfs with buildroot and unpacked it in a folder. so the normal inkbox boot sequence is

U-Boot -> Kernel -> Initrd -> Chroot to Alpine -> Chroot to Glibc rootfs -> InkBox


[3/19/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
oh!!


[3/19/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
why chroot?


[3/19/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
well... I can't boot three rootfs at once


[3/19/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
but the chroots still have access to /dev /sys and etc. so it's pretty much like normal


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
so even the Alpine system is running in a chroot
but you can't see it
it's in a jail


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
the real "root" is the initrd


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
wait I'll show you the rcS for the initrd


[3/19/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
it runs a static busybox and is 3mb in size (compressed)


[3/19/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-6871D.txt


[3/19/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
there you go


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
there's a new "boot" partition, containing the relevant "flags" and based on if the flags's content, the boot can change


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
e.g. 0.1.2 introduces unattended kernel updates, so the KERNEL_FLASH is set in order to flash the kernel, then reboot


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
```chroot /alpine /sbin/openrc "sysinit"
                        chroot /mnt /opt/bin/diagnostics_splash
                        sleep 2
                        chroot /mnt /opt/recovery/launch.sh &
                fi``` RECOVERY?


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
oops caps lock


[3/19/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
:/


[3/19/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
```if [ "$INPUT_LOG" == "" ]; then
                        mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt
                        mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/boot
                        mount --move /proc /mnt/proc
                        mount --move /sys /mnt/sys
                        mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /mnt/dev
                        mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/tmp
                        chroot /mnt /sbin/openrc "sysinit"
                        chroot /mnt /sbin/openrc "boot"
                        chroot /mnt /sbin/openrc "default"
                ``` this is the startup


[3/19/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
right


[3/19/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
yes, it starts by detecting if you pressed the power button in the first three seconds of boot


[3/19/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
then if you pressed nothing, it boots in normal inkbox


[3/19/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
if you pressed something, recoveryfs


[3/19/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
works everytime (or almost)


[3/19/2021 4:00 AM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/19/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
also, it shows a nicer logo at bootup due to ... previous framebuffer shenanigans

also, in the recovery options, you can choose the onboard storage size


[3/19/2021 4:02 AM] tux_linux
Now it shows where I programmed it to show; before it was... strange and ugly


[3/19/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
NICE!


[3/19/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
for now it goes only up to 1024M


[3/19/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
but it'll grow in the future


[3/19/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
options: 64, 256, 512, 1024


[3/19/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
64 was just for quick recovery/restore testing though; it's so small you can't even apply an upstream update


[3/19/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
64M is tiny


[3/19/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
yeah, I set that there only because I wanted to go fast and not wear too much the SD


[3/19/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
1024 is a good size tho


[3/19/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
and "it just works"


[3/19/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
designing a new UI on google drawings and seeing which one i like


[3/19/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
what is that?


[3/19/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
i basically ripped off nickel so then i started over


[3/19/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
oh


[3/19/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
basically a drawing app


[3/19/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
ok; yeah, early InkBox was done entirely in C with FBInk


[3/19/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/unknown-2F4C2.png


[3/19/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
not much at all but yeah


[3/19/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
nice
maybe put the hour to the right and inkbox to the left

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/19/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
It was so discouraging I stopped coding it after the splash screen


[3/19/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
the only surviving thing is that splash screen you see every time it powers up


[3/19/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
that would be extremely painful


[3/19/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
C is hard (for me)


[3/19/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
in C... yeah
I still had to handle touch input
I said to myself: "No."


[3/19/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill
touch input, in my mind, is insanely hard


[3/19/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
so I put it on hold for a few weeks, experimented with NickelBoot (which I should really start sometime soon) and came back with kobox and blabla


[3/19/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
your mind is right


[3/19/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/19/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
yikes!!!


[3/19/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
i think maybe put inkbox into a "usable" state, then start with NB


[3/19/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
yeah; I had to be *creative* to design that for kobox


[3/19/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
YEAH


[3/19/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
like the "quadruple-booting Kobo" showcased on hackaday


[3/19/2021 4:12 AM] the.mightydill
hahahaha yes


[3/19/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
also, nickelboot was C and FBInk too; that's why I relied only on the power button for input
I'd have died if I tried with the touchscreen


[3/19/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
but Qt will ease things *a lot*


[3/19/2021 4:12 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/19/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
*maybe* boot different inkbox versions? just an idea


[3/19/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
yea, like you have the menu
```
Nickel
InkBox
InkBox Diags

Reboot
Poweroff
```


[3/19/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
why would you do that now?


[3/19/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
I mean, new versions are only getting better from the point we're in now


[3/19/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
maybe when it'll become beta


[3/19/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
also, I'm thinking to add an emergency recovery shell via usbnet in diags
like barebones `busybox telnetd -F`


[3/19/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
nickelgrub


[3/19/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
HAHAHAHAHA


[3/19/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
Actually, I think NickelBoot is just fine


[3/19/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
like it fits well with "Nickel DBus", "NickelMenu", etc.


[3/19/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
I really got to start working on it


[3/19/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but i nicknamed it "nickelgrub"


[3/19/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
yeah, it sounds nice too


[3/19/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/19/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
have to go


[3/19/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill

for code?


[3/19/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux


[3/19/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
also when is 0.1.2 officially released


[3/19/2021 8:33 PM] tux_linux
sometime soon... maybe sunday


[3/19/2021 8:33 PM] tux_linux
I need to set up the security policy and encrypt update archives so it's difficult to access the rootfs from outside of the reader (except if you remove the sd)


[3/19/2021 8:40 PM] tux_linux
and again, the computer you put the SD on has to be able to read ext2/3/4 fs


[3/20/2021 2:51 AM] the.mightydill
no problem


[3/20/2021 2:51 AM] the.mightydill
linux


[3/20/2021 2:51 AM] tux_linux
yeah, you're good


[3/20/2021 2:52 AM] tux_linux
I set up a new boot process that checks if the user violated the security policy by rooting the device before a factory reset via diags


[3/20/2021 2:53 AM] tux_linux
i'm currently testing it


[3/20/2021 2:53 AM] the.mightydill
nice!


[3/20/2021 2:53 AM] tux_linux
i can show you the rcS if you want


[3/20/2021 2:54 AM] the.mightydill
yes please


[3/20/2021 2:54 AM] tux_linux
also, there's unpartitioned space on sector 79872 that sets the "rooted" value so it's even more difficult to work around the boot process


[3/20/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
There's the first kernel rcS

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-D58B8.txt


[3/20/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
(the one that is there when the kobo is rooted)


[3/20/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux


{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/message-082DA.txt


[3/20/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
and there's the standard kernel one


[3/20/2021 2:56 AM] tux_linux
the kobo can be rooted by going into diags->reset options->reset and allow root


[3/20/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux
that process flashes some things to the unpartitioned space, and it allows usbnet and ssh, also passwd for root leads to /bin/sh instead of /sbin/nologin when the kobo is not rooted


[3/20/2021 2:57 AM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/20/2021 2:58 AM] tux_linux
so basically, if the new rooted kernel detects that the "rooted" flag was not changed in the unpartitionned space, it reflashes the standard one and thus all starts over again for the user


[3/20/2021 3:00 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 3:00 AM] tux_linux
that was the headache of the day


[3/20/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
Now I have to set up the encrypted update thing


[3/20/2021 3:24 AM] the.mightydill
good luck


[3/20/2021 3:29 AM] tux_linux
yeah, I think it's going to be 0.2-beta after all


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
or 0.2-alpha


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
but there's a big jump from 0.1.1 there


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
yeah that would make sense for it to be beta


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
but wait


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
i'll give you some ui ideas sometime today


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/20/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
so it can be a "major" update

yeah, from the end user PoV

{Reactions}

[3/20/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
me it's a major update since I put an initrd in there haha


[3/20/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill
haa true for devs


[3/20/2021 3:32 AM] tux_linux
but there will still be a new font
and some settings improvements


[3/20/2021 3:32 AM] tux_linux
e.g., there will be reset config in diags but the option will also be there in the stock options


[3/20/2021 3:33 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/20/2021 3:33 AM] tux_linux
also, did I said it to you that now in diags you'll be able to update the software? like it's useful when the package ends up corrupted or something like that


[3/20/2021 3:34 AM] the.mightydill
oh cool!!

[3/20/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
well... not rooting


[3/20/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
but config... maybe

ooh


[3/20/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
UI scaling factor


[3/20/2021 3:39 AM] tux_linux
and also default font size


[3/20/2021 3:39 AM] tux_linux
alignment, etc


[3/20/2021 3:39 AM] tux_linux
what do you think?

wow kde is so flexible


[3/20/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
of course


[3/20/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
`dpkg` right


[3/20/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
well yes, but there's apt


[3/20/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
oh there is


[3/20/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
wait how do i add myself to sudoers


[3/20/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
google it up


[3/20/2021 4:26 AM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/20/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
does apper installer usually take this long to load? it's been 3 minutes


[3/20/2021 4:32 AM] the.mightydill
i'm opening a deb


[3/20/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
ok its not opening


[3/20/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux for a tar.gz i do this, correct?

[3/20/2021 4:37 AM] ferminolaiz
Pretty much, yeap


[3/20/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
k thanks! :D


[3/20/2021 4:37 AM] ferminolaiz
That will extract it, prepare it, compile it and install it


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] ferminolaiz
But for every source there are probably instructions in the README file


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
so i use `nano` to view the README, or `cat`?


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] ferminolaiz
Or cat


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
to extract a deb, you need `ar -x`


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
tar will not work


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh didn't see it


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] the.mightydill
no, for tar.gz


[3/20/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
oh


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
tar -xzf or tar -xzvf if you want to see the files extracted


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
used -zxf


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
but do you have `build-essential` installed?


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
there's no readme apparently


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
without a compiler you won't be able to do much


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
ok wait let me apt it


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
what is the program you're trying to compile?


[3/20/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
discord


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
huh?


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
discord


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
it's already compiled as a binary


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
it gave me a tar.gz tho


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
you don't need to do anything but `cd discord-folder && ./discord`


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
ok!


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
well a tar.gz is like a zip


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
a compressed archive


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
ye i know


[3/20/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
it doesn't mean that it necessary contains source code


[3/20/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
`./discord`?


[3/20/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/20/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
the `./` says to the shell "hey, I want to execute that file"


[3/20/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux
the `.` means current directory


[3/20/2021 4:41 AM] the.mightydill
im in /home/dill/Downloads/Discord and it says no such file or directory


[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
`ls`?


[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
```chrome_100_percent.pak  discord.png   libvk_swiftshader.so  resources.pak

[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
./Discord then


[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
`./Discord`?


[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/20/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
but strange


[3/20/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
it's not an usual practice to name files in capitals in Linux


[3/20/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
idk


[3/20/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
people more tend to use camel-case naming convention or snake case


[3/20/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
not familiar with snake, but camelCase yeah


[3/20/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill

same thing


[3/20/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
idk


[3/20/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
try running with --no-sandbox


[3/20/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
but this can cause security issues


[3/20/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[3/20/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
it worked when i `chmod`ed again

how did you learn all this linux stuff?


[3/20/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
years


[3/20/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
7 years


[3/20/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
since you were 8 and threw away your windows laptop... :p


[3/20/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/20/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
wait if i'm in an ubuntu liveusb environment


[3/20/2021 4:53 AM] the.mightydill
will it save any changes


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
what do you think


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
e.g. logging into discord, installing chromium, etc


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
exactly


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
but you can customize it before you pack the iso


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
in an archive manager?


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
no


[3/20/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
complicated mksquashfs rootfs and iso stuff


[3/20/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
oh

[3/20/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
but it can technically be "ubuntuiso"?


[3/20/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux
yes, but it's built differently


[3/20/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
oh, it's built for arch


[3/20/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
*smacks forehead*


[3/20/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
you can check that out though https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/fsprotect

@tux-linux the mirror seems to be down for ubuntu iso


[3/20/2021 4:20 PM] the.mightydill
k doing the torrent thing


[3/20/2021 4:41 PM] tux_linux
ok, that's great
I'd just like it if you stopped pinging me all the time; I can see your messages; though, I'm not always online. When I am, I check them. thanks


[3/20/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
ah... sorry!


[3/20/2021 4:52 PM] the.mightydill
i understand not always being online


[3/20/2021 5:01 PM] tux_linux
it's ok


[3/20/2021 5:01 PM] tux_linux
do you think I should change the default dpi?


[3/20/2021 5:02 PM] the.mightydill
what do you mean by dpi


[3/20/2021 5:02 PM] tux_linux
ui scale


[3/20/2021 5:02 PM] the.mightydill
hmmm


[3/20/2021 5:02 PM] the.mightydill
i think make the text smaller and remove the bold
if you want
and if that's what you mean

[3/20/2021 5:03 PM] tux_linux
it's at 192 by default; there's a picture when I set it to 182
you can compare with your Kobo


[3/20/2021 5:03 PM] the.mightydill
no i think 192 is better


[3/20/2021 5:03 PM] tux_linux
I think I'll replace the big pushbuttons with icons


[3/20/2021 5:04 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/20/2021 5:04 PM] tux_linux
at start it didn't work because scaling was kind of horrible


[3/20/2021 5:04 PM] the.mightydill
and maybe a nickel-like layout, with "settings", "apps", "reader", etc., but on the right


[3/20/2021 5:04 PM] tux_linux
Right?


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
i.e. not on the bottom


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
but a sidebar


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] tux_linux
maybe


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
and the empty space... recently read books, and unread books


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
on the homescreen


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] tux_linux
that's for another update


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/20/2021 5:05 PM] the.mightydill
have to go, i have a class


[3/20/2021 5:06 PM] tux_linux

AWESOME


[3/20/2021 7:46 PM] the.mightydill
also i seem only to be able to run discord by going `cd Downloads/Discord && ./discord` from konsole


[3/20/2021 7:51 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2021 7:52 PM] the.mightydill
the new inkbox ui looks much more streamlined


[3/20/2021 7:52 PM] tux_linux
only because of the icons?


[3/20/2021 7:52 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i feel like the icons make it look good


[3/20/2021 7:52 PM] tux_linux
yeah, maybe


[3/20/2021 7:52 PM] the.mightydill
not that the other one was bad, this is just better


[3/20/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux

it can't update the icon right when the cable is plugged in, but if you show/hide the menu it will change


[3/20/2021 7:59 PM] the.mightydill
great


[3/20/2021 7:59 PM] tux_linux
I'm wondering if I should put it on the main menu too


[3/20/2021 8:00 PM] tux_linux
but I don't know where


[3/20/2021 8:00 PM] the.mightydill
on the top, to replace InkBox


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] the.mightydill
(you mean the home screen, right?)


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] tux_linux
it'd look ... strange


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] the.mightydill
hmm true


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] tux_linux
maybe replace the date?


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] tux_linux
is the date something useful?


[3/20/2021 8:01 PM] the.mightydill
hmm yeah


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
useful or replace the date


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] the.mightydill
wait no actually only the time is useful


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] the.mightydill
replace the date


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
or maybe


[3/20/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
put the date *and* batt level


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] the.mightydill
but there's too little space


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] the.mightydill
unless we remove the day and year


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] tux_linux
yeah, on the mini it's tiny


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] tux_linux
but if I reduce the dpi a little


[3/20/2021 8:03 PM] tux_linux
wait I'll test it


[3/20/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/20/2021 8:04 PM] tux_linux
i was on my aura and libra; development is easier because I don't need to update the isas each time


[3/20/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
but be careful not to brick them; they have emmc


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
yeah sure


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
that's why i got my mini


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
it's the normal .adds addon


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
i wanted a glo hd at first but it was sold


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
like some features are disabled but for battery things it was ok


[3/20/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
yeah glo hds are great


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
when they're not broken ofc


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
yeah like initrd wouldnt make sense with .adds


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
it would make *zero* sense to be honest


[3/20/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
the kobo would already be dead


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
i'd likely have failed in my first attempt to build a working kernel


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
exactly


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
unless we have a serial connection


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
like, if the mini didn't have mmc it'd have been dead since 1 month ago


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
btw i can set one up now


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
yeah, and even that


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
really


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
ye i just realized i have an arduino and i can do it with that


[3/20/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
i don't know much about these but you can try if you want


[3/20/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
ye ok


[3/20/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
theyre basically raspberry pi's but with less features


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
but it's a microcontroller right?


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
it can't run normal linux like the rpi


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
the rpi is like a Kobo on steroids


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
a cpu 10 times more powerful


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] the.mightydill
oh cool


[3/20/2021 8:09 PM] the.mightydill
that would be good for a kobo, better cpu

we need more ram too :/


[3/20/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/20/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
ofc


[3/20/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
1024mb would already be a great upgrade


[3/20/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/20/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
Here's what it looks like on the Mini

brb


[3/20/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
but the sidebar is probably not going to be doable


[3/20/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
because the icons would look pretty strange vertically, stretched up


[3/20/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
but maybe


[3/20/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill
yea true


[3/20/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
but I could try something


[3/20/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
I'll see

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/20/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
but for 0.2 the layout will stay the same, and then I'll look if I can make some changes


[3/20/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
👍


[3/20/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
maybe for 0.2.1


[3/20/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
i think you should wait before releasing 0.2, might want a few other formats supported


[3/20/2021 8:19 PM] the.mightydill
your choice tho


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
f o r m a t s


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
it took already like 1 week to develop the txt parser


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
oh sh-


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
nvm then


[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
sure, I'll do epub sometime soon but for 0.2 it's going to stay like that

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/20/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
epub is probably gonna take like a month


[3/20/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
yikes


[3/20/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
forget i said that then 😬


[3/20/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
you mean, your account got banned?


[3/20/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
yes


[3/20/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
you could ask to get back


[3/20/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
i did; no reply yet


[3/20/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
it's not the end of the world

[3/20/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill
well i mean it hurts but i understand why they did it


[3/20/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill
ye but it's technically trolling


[3/20/2021 8:58 PM] tux_linux
you could say that you'll remove the link


[3/20/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill
i did


[3/20/2021 9:01 PM] tux_linux
do you know who did ban you?


[3/20/2021 9:02 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
well, if you apologized and said that you'll not do it again they might get you back in


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i did


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
they know that you're a good user; you had 2296 posts


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] the.mightydill
i *did*?!


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
well i mean


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] the.mightydill
well ye but *what really*


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
when you were not banned


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i know


[3/20/2021 9:03 PM] tux_linux
2296


[3/20/2021 9:04 PM] the.mightydill

*wait* for some reason on deepin, i'm getting something similar to partial ghosting on e-ink on chromium


[3/20/2021 9:13 PM] tux_linux
huh?


[3/20/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
my reaction exactly


[3/20/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
"what? i'm on lcd but this looks like ghosting"


[3/20/2021 9:14 PM] tux_linux

[3/20/2021 9:15 PM] tux_linux
you should really use another os if it doesn't work


[3/20/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
wait let me switch to arch then


[3/20/2021 9:15 PM] tux_linux
or maybe fiddle with drivers but I can't really help you with that

nevermind it's probably normal


[3/20/2021 9:17 PM] the.mightydill
k switching


[3/20/2021 9:19 PM] the.mightydill

[3/20/2021 9:20 PM] the.mightydill
is there a way to uninstall gnome and install kde on arch? `pacman -R gnome` and `pacman -S kde-plasma` or something around those lines


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] tux_linux
But you can install the two


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
oh wait really


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
on different ttys?


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] tux_linux
Or you can reinstall Arch


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
i mean after gentoo, *sure*


[3/20/2021 9:23 PM] tux_linux
You can choose which one you want with sddm


[3/20/2021 9:24 PM] tux_linux
But things are probably going to conflict


[3/20/2021 9:24 PM] the.mightydill
i like plasma better than gnome


[3/20/2021 9:24 PM] the.mightydill
so i'll uninstall gnome and get plasma


[3/20/2021 9:24 PM] the.mightydill
but for that i'll need sddm right


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] the.mightydill
or lightdm


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] tux_linux
systemctl start sddm


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] the.mightydill
is that similar to `rc-update add sddm default` or am i just dumb


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] tux_linux
Or systemctl enable sddm
If you want to start it at boot


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/20/2021 9:25 PM] the.mightydill
ye enable looks like the way to go


[3/20/2021 9:26 PM] the.mightydill
the package name is `kde-plasma` correct


[3/20/2021 9:26 PM] tux_linux
No it's just plasma


[3/20/2021 9:26 PM] the.mightydill
thx, and also will i lose apps


[3/20/2021 9:26 PM] the.mightydill
like chromium, discord


[3/20/2021 9:27 PM] tux_linux
No


[3/20/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
ok thx


[3/20/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
doing it now


[3/20/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/20/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
... :/


[3/20/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
apparently the mirrors are down or something


[3/20/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
*all* of them


[3/20/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
i had to reinstall gnome, which for some reason worked


[3/20/2021 9:45 PM] the.mightydill
i also had to do `pacman -R -s -c gnome`


[3/20/2021 9:46 PM] tux_linux
Impossible


[3/20/2021 9:46 PM] tux_linux
It must be a connection issue


[3/20/2021 9:47 PM] tux_linux
It used the local cache


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
oh i see


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
i'm on ethernet


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
i'll try again


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
lucky i didnt reboot


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
maybe it did something with network manager that the pc didn't like


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
it would've stayed there


[3/20/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
/var/cache/pacman or something like that


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
oh wait i thought it was in ram but yeah im dumb


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
you should install dhcpcd before and if it doesn't work with the network, run it


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
can i *first* install kde *then* remove gnome?


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
as you want


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
i use dhcp though


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
dhcpCD ?


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
nvm


[3/20/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/20/2021 10:01 PM] tux_linux
or dhclient


[3/20/2021 10:01 PM] the.mightydill
i'll try now


[3/20/2021 10:01 PM] the.mightydill
i think dhclient


[3/20/2021 10:01 PM] tux_linux
it's as good


[3/20/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
this is impossible


[3/20/2021 10:02 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/20/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
ping works for google.com


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] the.mightydill
but its saying all the mirrors gave a 404


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -Sy`


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] the.mightydill
and something about rsync and libcurl


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
and it's urgent


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] the.mightydill
ok and also i'll go `-Syy`


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -Syu`


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] the.mightydill
ye typo


[3/20/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
warning your system might break


[3/20/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
but that's to be expected with arch distros


[3/20/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
also you should reboot after the syu


[3/20/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
just to see if the install hasn't burned up


[3/20/2021 10:07 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/20/2021 10:07 PM] the.mightydill
even if it does, a reinstall is ez


[3/20/2021 10:07 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] the.mightydill
would it be possible to have a cron daemon do syu or would that break the system


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] tux_linux
yes, ofc


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] tux_linux
yes to both questions


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] the.mightydill
ok rebooting


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] tux_linux
you never know what's going to happen with the new upgrade


[3/20/2021 10:08 PM] tux_linux
but you can if you want


[3/20/2021 10:09 PM] the.mightydill
nah i can do it


[3/20/2021 10:12 PM] the.mightydill
ok for my last breaking-the-system-stupid-question, do i have to do `pacman -R -s -c gnome`


[3/20/2021 10:12 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/20/2021 10:12 PM] tux_linux
what does the -s and -c options mean?


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
because with plain `-R`, it complained about dependencies


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
they remove packages that depend on it, and remove what the package depends on


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
afaik


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
that means if you force the uninstall your system will likely break at some point


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
so you either should install plasma alongside


[3/20/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
or reinstall arch


[3/20/2021 10:14 PM] the.mightydill
alongside i think


[3/20/2021 10:14 PM] tux_linux
`pacman -S plasma` will do


[3/20/2021 10:14 PM] the.mightydill
k


[3/20/2021 10:15 PM] the.mightydill
*now* it works


[3/20/2021 10:15 PM] the.mightydill
thx

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/20/2021 10:17 PM] the.mightydill
then `systemctl enable sddm` then `systemctl start sddm`


[3/20/2021 10:17 PM] the.mightydill
correct

[3/20/2021 10:18 PM] tux_linux
but you can stay with gdm too

konsole is never launching


[3/20/2021 10:55 PM] the.mightydill
*gnome-terminal


[3/20/2021 10:56 PM] tux_linux
try launching it in konsole and look at what it spits out


[3/20/2021 10:56 PM] the.mightydill
i dont have konsole; pacmanning it


[3/20/2021 10:56 PM] the.mightydill
"pacmanning" should be a verb


[3/20/2021 10:57 PM] the.mightydill
it wont let me switch ttys help


[3/20/2021 10:57 PM] tux_linux
it should


[3/20/2021 10:57 PM] tux_linux
try again with all f keys


[3/20/2021 10:58 PM] the.mightydill
brief login screen then tty1 pulled me back


[3/20/2021 10:58 PM] tux_linux
do you have xterm in there?


[3/20/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/20/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
just gnome-terminal


[3/20/2021 10:59 PM] the.mightydill
better stock up on some terminals i guess


[3/20/2021 10:59 PM] tux_linux
`kdesudo pacman -S xterm`


[3/20/2021 10:59 PM] tux_linux
type some chars in the desktop


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
it should launch krunner


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
from there you could launch a command


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
but wait


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
go back in gnome


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] tux_linux
there it should work


[3/20/2021 11:00 PM] the.mightydill
alt f2 is krunner


[3/20/2021 11:01 PM] the.mightydill
ok gnome


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
i know i shouldnt be surprised


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
but the kde cursor is in gnome


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
windows 10 cursor


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
that's where you can see that things have (sometimes badly) mixed up


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/20/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
well its better


[3/20/2021 11:07 PM] the.mightydill
switching to plasma


[3/20/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
now it works


[3/20/2021 11:09 PM] tux_linux
konsole ?


[3/20/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/20/2021 11:10 PM] tux_linux

what will sda7 be


[3/21/2021 2:04 AM] the.mightydill
what's "esp"


[3/21/2021 2:04 AM] the.mightydill
efi something partition?

no


[3/21/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
you'll wear out the flash storage
and you'll wear it out *extremely quickly*, especially if you enable swap


[3/21/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
just don't


[3/21/2021 3:11 PM] the.mightydill
exactly


[3/21/2021 3:11 PM] the.mightydill
"insane and dumb"


[3/21/2021 3:11 PM] the.mightydill
also ubuntu is always booting into emergency mode :/


[3/21/2021 3:11 PM] the.mightydill
pretty much useless, i'll delete sda7 and then install manjaro or redhat or something


[3/21/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
You mean CentOS?


[3/21/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
what?


[3/21/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux
RedHat is not free


[3/21/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
oh-


[3/21/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
i'll get manjaro


[3/21/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux
KDE?


[3/21/2021 4:41 PM] tux_linux
Manjaro KDE I mean


[3/21/2021 4:42 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/21/2021 4:42 PM] tux_linux
That is a pretty solid indicator that your multidistro setup is not rock solid


[3/21/2021 4:43 PM] the.mightydill
yep, or maybe its because ubuntu is made for efi


[3/21/2021 4:43 PM] tux_linux
Idk


[3/21/2021 4:44 PM] the.mightydill
but every other distro is perfectly working (except arch, which has a weird mix of gnome and kde)


[3/21/2021 4:44 PM] tux_linux
I don't install distros on hard disks very often, and when I do, I want to go back to my liveusb


[3/21/2021 4:44 PM] the.mightydill
why liveusb?


[3/21/2021 4:45 PM] tux_linux
Custom liveusb
Yeah, I like my OS to be as clean as it was designed as every boot up


[3/21/2021 4:45 PM] the.mightydill
oh that makes sense


[3/21/2021 4:46 PM] the.mightydill
i don't like "clean" but i like to customize my environment, which makes me hate the windows gui and love kde

👍 

[3/21/2021 4:51 PM] the.mightydill
btw, how do you get kde with manjaro? iirc, manjaro comes with gnome


[3/21/2021 4:51 PM] tux_linux
there are multiple versions


[3/21/2021 4:52 PM] tux_linux

[3/21/2021 5:10 PM] the.mightydill
ooh, i like it


[3/21/2021 5:10 PM] tux_linux
it's available in nightly


[3/21/2021 5:10 PM] the.mightydill
btw, to turn off the red circle on the discord icon, mute the servers that have a white thing on the left


[3/21/2021 5:11 PM] the.mightydill
cool!


[3/21/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
yeah, I'm so used to it that it has become the default favicon haha


[3/21/2021 5:11 PM] the.mightydill
haha that used to be the same for me


[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] the.mightydill
wait can i get pacman on other distros? or is that a crazy thought?


[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
you might want to look at Bedrock Linux


[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
but there's pacman for manjaro


[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] the.mightydill
from the name im guessing it's very stable


[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
well, go check it out

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/21/2021 5:12 PM] the.mightydill
yeah because manjaro is based on arch


[3/21/2021 5:13 PM] the.mightydill
woah


[3/21/2021 5:13 PM] the.mightydill
i like it


[3/21/2021 5:14 PM] the.mightydill
the idea of mixing distros


[3/21/2021 5:14 PM] the.mightydill
probably not so stable tho


[3/21/2021 5:14 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/21/2021 5:15 PM] the.mightydill
in fact i think i prefer doing that than installing manjaro; manjaro is basically arch


[3/21/2021 5:15 PM] tux_linux
exactly

that's what will show up when a user tries to root the reader without a factory reset


[3/21/2021 5:16 PM] the.mightydill
great!!!


[3/21/2021 5:16 PM] tux_linux
does it seem serious enough?


[3/21/2021 5:16 PM] the.mightydill
yes

did you get a reply from MR?


[3/21/2021 5:17 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/21/2021 5:17 PM] the.mightydill
not yet


[3/21/2021 5:18 PM] the.mightydill
```Installation
Bedrock allows users to mix and match parts of other distros. The install process is considered such a feature. To "get" the install process from another distro, Bedrock converts an install of another distro into Bedrock in-place.

Thus, first, install some Linux distro. When choosing such a distro:

Consider if it has an install process you like. This is the entire point of Bedrock's ability to use another distro's installer.
Consider compatibility with Bedrock.
Do not consider if you like the distro's files. You can swap out key components with those from other distros from it and remove it later.
While Bedrock's hijack install is only officially tested against fresh installs of other distros, no known issues exist hijacking a long-running install. Just make sure to back up first.
``` can i just do it with ubuntu?


[3/21/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
well yes but canonical doesn't want that


[3/21/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 5:19 PM] tux_linux
better to do Linux From Scratch


[3/21/2021 5:19 PM] the.mightydill
lfs? that'd take a *looong* time afaik


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
but you'll be proud


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
even prouder than with gentoo


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
and you can customize it the way you want


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] tux_linux
you can even install kde on it


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] the.mightydill
cool


[3/21/2021 5:20 PM] the.mightydill
hmmmm maybe


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
wait so its basically building your own distro?


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
"dillux"


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] tux_linux
haha


[3/21/2021 5:21 PM] the.mightydill
"elektrux"


[3/21/2021 5:22 PM] tux_linux
yeah!


[3/21/2021 5:23 PM] the.mightydill
wowow the table of contents looks like this will take months


[3/21/2021 5:23 PM] tux_linux
i did it in one week


[3/21/2021 5:23 PM] the.mightydill
i'll have to *compile* everything, right


[3/21/2021 5:23 PM] tux_linux
yes, like gentoo


[3/21/2021 5:24 PM] the.mightydill
ye but im *kind* of new (not really but yeah)


[3/21/2021 5:24 PM] the.mightydill
:/ then we'd better get started


[3/21/2021 5:24 PM] the.mightydill
let me get the LFS pdf on my kobo

[3/21/2021 5:25 PM] tux_linux
take one week or two to familiarize with the concepts, google them up, understand what you don't and then you'll be ready


[3/21/2021 5:25 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/21/2021 5:26 PM] the.mightydill

do I remove the "in such situations" ?

yeah i think


[3/21/2021 5:28 PM] tux_linux
ok

i'll read the thing over and over until i understand everything because i really dont want to mess up


[3/21/2021 5:30 PM] tux_linux
yeah, good idea


[3/21/2021 5:30 PM] tux_linux
take your time


[3/21/2021 5:31 PM] the.mightydill
the table of contents is... intimidating


[3/21/2021 5:31 PM] tux_linux
read each chapter at a time

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/21/2021 5:33 PM] tux_linux
also, are the buttons "Continue anyway" and "Process" OK? Or should they be like "Continue anyway" and "Reset" ?


[3/21/2021 5:34 PM] the.mightydill
i think people might get mixed up between "continue anyway" and "proceed" so i think "reset" would be better


[3/21/2021 5:34 PM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[3/21/2021 5:36 PM] tux_linux
ok I think 0.2 will come without encrypted updates


[3/21/2021 5:36 PM] tux_linux
it's a big thing


[3/21/2021 5:37 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/21/2021 5:37 PM] tux_linux
and I would like to finally make a new release


[3/21/2021 5:37 PM] tux_linux
I'll work on them for the next update


[3/21/2021 5:37 PM] the.mightydill
that would draw more attention as well, i still dont get why nobody responded to the thread


[3/21/2021 5:37 PM] tux_linux
because they see that the main reader framework is trash


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
for inkbox? it's only a first release; understandable


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] tux_linux
but I'll do a video, a big walkthrough of all the use-cases/situations/inkbox things, and I'll post that on r/linux


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
or r/kobo


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] tux_linux
so maybe people will get interested


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] tux_linux
weeeeeelll


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] tux_linux
there aren't many people on r/kobo


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] tux_linux
I could crosspost but that's not how we would get people interested


[3/21/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
hm


[3/21/2021 5:39 PM] the.mightydill
maybe look for other kobo forums? there cant be just mobileread


[3/21/2021 5:39 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/21/2021 5:39 PM] tux_linux
mobileread is certainly the most active


[3/21/2021 5:40 PM] tux_linux
I'll also work on porting it to the glo hd


[3/21/2021 5:40 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/21/2021 5:40 PM] the.mightydill
yeah and maybe (even tho it's EXTREMELY dangerous) a dd image for emmc devices? if it's possible


[3/21/2021 5:40 PM] the.mightydill
and if people can take the risk


[3/21/2021 5:40 PM] tux_linux
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
I mean, even myself I wouldn't take the risk


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
unless I have U-Boot access


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i wouldnt either


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
and even there, not all Kobos permit you to access the u-boot shell


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
like, you can't on the mini


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
the glo hd is fine though


[3/21/2021 5:41 PM] the.mightydill
i'm going to download the arduino app and see if i can set up a serial with the mini


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] tux_linux
but you could set up usbnet


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] tux_linux
you'd have shell access to 0.1.1


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] tux_linux
now that you can restart the computer


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but i think serial would be "cooler" :p


[3/21/2021 5:42 PM] tux_linux
yeah ofc


[3/21/2021 5:43 PM] the.mightydill
let me see if i can unearth my duponts


[3/21/2021 5:44 PM] the.mightydill
found them


[3/21/2021 5:44 PM] the.mightydill
ok so i power it off, wire it, and power it on?


[3/21/2021 5:44 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
but you have to figure out how to access serial with your pc


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
you can take toothpicks to connect the wires


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
be careful though, they must not touch each other


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] the.mightydill
iirc arduino ide has a serial thing


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
or bad things could happen


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] the.mightydill
and i believe my uno has usb-serial


[3/21/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
nice


[3/21/2021 5:46 PM] the.mightydill
i remember making a social distance detector thing with my arduino last year; that was fun


[3/21/2021 5:47 PM] the.mightydill
is it...crashing?


[3/21/2021 5:47 PM] the.mightydill
it crashed; i'm gonna download the tar


[3/21/2021 5:48 PM] tux_linux
crashing... what?


[3/21/2021 5:48 PM] the.mightydill
app


[3/21/2021 5:48 PM] tux_linux
oh


[3/21/2021 5:48 PM] tux_linux
you can hook up the wires like that

cut the end of the toothpicks by one millimeter, or elsewise it won't stay in place


[3/21/2021 5:49 PM] the.mightydill
i recommend getting a new microsd for the mini


[3/21/2021 5:49 PM] tux_linux
why?


[3/21/2021 5:49 PM] tux_linux
4g is fine


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but with all my mods, i got a 16g and it was much better


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
i updated and it said it was full


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
I still have plenty of space for inkbox


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but for me, i had nickel, and everything


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
every mod in existence


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
that i could find


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
also. people aren't gonna like it if I provide a 16G sd image


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/21/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
the mini came with 4g


[3/21/2021 5:51 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/21/2021 5:51 PM] the.mightydill
`tar -xzf arduino-1.8.13-linux64.tar.xz`?


[3/21/2021 5:51 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/21/2021 5:51 PM] tux_linux
`tar -xf`


[3/21/2021 5:51 PM] tux_linux
because it's an xz archive


[3/21/2021 5:52 PM] tux_linux
the `z` tells it to use `gunzip` to extract it


[3/21/2021 5:52 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/21/2021 5:52 PM] tux_linux
so now it must use `xz -d` or something like that


[3/21/2021 5:55 PM] the.mightydill
```[dill@archlinux ~]$ tar -xf Downloads/arduino-1.8.13-linux64.tar.xz

[3/21/2021 5:55 PM] tux_linux
well


[3/21/2021 5:55 PM] tux_linux
tar extracted the archive in the dir you were


[3/21/2021 5:55 PM] tux_linux
when you extracted it


[3/21/2021 5:55 PM] the.mightydill
oh

[3/21/2021 6:00 PM] the.mightydill
rebooting


[3/21/2021 6:03 PM] the.mightydill
so... mini's tx to arduino's rx?


[3/21/2021 6:03 PM] the.mightydill
and vice versa?


[3/21/2021 6:03 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 6:03 PM] tux_linux
connect the ground also


[3/21/2021 6:04 PM] the.mightydill
to V?


[3/21/2021 6:04 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/21/2021 6:04 PM] tux_linux
GND


[3/21/2021 6:05 PM] the.mightydill
theres no GND, but theres one with three lines


[3/21/2021 6:05 PM] tux_linux
it's that

*i need tape or something*


[3/21/2021 6:15 PM] tux_linux
it likely will break


[3/21/2021 6:15 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/21/2021 6:15 PM] tux_linux
as soon as you touch the wire with just the tip of your finger


[3/21/2021 6:15 PM] tux_linux

[3/21/2021 6:18 PM] tux_linux
are you excited for tonight's 0.2 update?


[3/21/2021 6:18 PM] the.mightydill
yeah definitely, i want to try out the initrd and the reset options!


[3/21/2021 6:19 PM] tux_linux
nice! I say tonight but it may come later this night because uploading the sd image will take a pretty long time

yeah


[3/21/2021 6:20 PM] tux_linux
like uploading a 1gb file is a nightmare


[3/21/2021 6:20 PM] tux_linux
it takes like 4 and a half hours


[3/21/2021 6:20 PM] the.mightydill
one time my wifi was like 0.5mbps and it took hours for 4gb


[3/21/2021 6:20 PM] the.mightydill
dang

you can install `base-devel`

then `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/minicom` and `cd minicom` and `makepkg -si` and it should be installed

what


[3/21/2021 7:14 PM] the.mightydill
the mini


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] the.mightydill
fortunately, its fine


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
it's always stressful


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
sometimes mine doesn't want to power on neither


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] the.mightydill
yea, especially since it was unresponsive and frozen


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
maybe you fried the serial port tho


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] the.mightydill
perhaps


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
*oops*


[3/21/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
well if it's still fine you always have that


[3/21/2021 7:16 PM] tux_linux
it's only the serial port


[3/21/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
haha thats common with me 
"oops i fried *insert thing here*"


[3/21/2021 7:16 PM] tux_linux
haha


[3/21/2021 7:16 PM] the.mightydill
afaik dupont wires should work with both rasp pi and arduino, right


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
but if you buy raspberry pi zero, you will need the bare wires


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] the.mightydill
why?


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
or attach a gpio layout like other pis


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
because the zero has just holes


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
not pins


[3/21/2021 7:17 PM] the.mightydill
oh like the mini


[3/21/2021 7:18 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:18 PM] the.mightydill
i'd rather get the 3b+


[3/21/2021 7:19 PM] tux_linux
yes it'd be good


[3/21/2021 7:19 PM] tux_linux

[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
no, because it's a microcontroller


[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
inkbox runs on linux


[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] the.mightydill
alpine


[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
yeah i would have installed alpine on it and set up the waveshare display


[3/21/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
then I'd have wrapped that up in a nice case


[3/21/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
a custom e-reader


[3/21/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
that'd be cool


[3/21/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
yes, check the Open Book Project


[3/21/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
though it's not running linux, only microcontroller software


[3/21/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
oh nice


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
you have "raspbian" right


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
i installed alpine too


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
wait no now it's called raspberry pi os


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
but raspbian is "fine" though it's very ugly


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
cool


[3/21/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
raspi os "just works"


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
also, it's great for compiling things because it's the same architecture (Armv7l) than on kobos


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
i liked the idea of getting a pi when i was 9 because i wanted to try raspbian


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
cool, and more cpu, right?


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
4 cores


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
1.8ghz


[3/21/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
you can overclock to 2.2ghz


[3/21/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill

[3/21/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill
nice


[3/21/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
but you can try raspbian on x86_64 too


[3/21/2021 7:26 PM] the.mightydill
yeah i know


[3/21/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
im hungry, i'll go get something


[3/21/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
brb


[3/21/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/21/2021 7:39 PM] the.mightydill
back


[3/21/2021 7:41 PM] the.mightydill
so does LFS have like a liveusb thing? or not, because it's "scratch"


[3/21/2021 7:44 PM] tux_linux
Is it normal that your last MR activity was today at 7:55AM?
Strange


[3/21/2021 7:44 PM] tux_linux
No liveusb


[3/21/2021 7:50 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/21/2021 7:50 PM] the.mightydill
its not strange


[3/21/2021 7:51 PM] the.mightydill
i logged in at 8


[3/21/2021 7:51 PM] the.mightydill
to see if it worked


[3/21/2021 7:52 PM] the.mightydill
wait, so then what environment do i do it in?


[3/21/2021 7:53 PM] the.mightydill
*where did my aura h2o go argh*


[3/21/2021 7:55 PM] the.mightydill
nvm i found it


[3/21/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Your standard Linux distro


[3/21/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
oh so arch


[3/21/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
thats nice


[3/21/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
i thought i had to do it in a console


[3/21/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
wait


[3/21/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
so


[3/21/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
what do i do if i dont have a bios partition


[3/21/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
wait what am i doing


[3/21/2021 8:20 PM] the.mightydill
i need to read the book first


[3/21/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
yeah im not reading it first or it'll take even longer


[3/21/2021 8:21 PM] the.mightydill
i'll skim it


[3/21/2021 8:32 PM] the.mightydill
```[dill@archlinux ~]$ ls brain
argh.txt
[dill@archlinux ~]$ cat argh.txt
WHY IS THIS SO CONFUSING```


[3/21/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
wait


[3/21/2021 8:38 PM] tux_linux
I suggest you get yourself a new drive for LFS


[3/21/2021 8:38 PM] tux_linux
a cheap $15 HDD of 60G will do


[3/21/2021 8:38 PM] tux_linux
-or- you do everything in a live cd


[3/21/2021 8:39 PM] tux_linux
ls / cat?


[3/21/2021 8:40 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
i made that btw


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
⬆️


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
i made that


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
lfs is confusing


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] tux_linux
why is it confusing?


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
sure


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] the.mightydill
idk it just is


[3/21/2021 8:41 PM] tux_linux
oh ok


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] the.mightydill
maybe i'll get some more


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
if you want


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] the.mightydill
but then where would i put the drive


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
a 60g partition did well for me


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
well


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
external drive


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] tux_linux
you plug it via usb


[3/21/2021 8:42 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
I have an adapter and I can just put any drive inside it, and access it via usb


[3/21/2021 8:43 PM] tux_linux
but there are integrated ones too


[3/21/2021 8:43 PM] the.mightydill
that's cool


[3/21/2021 8:44 PM] the.mightydill
so while im on arch, i'll be able to access discord?


[3/21/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
iso ?


[3/21/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
live usb?


[3/21/2021 8:44 PM] tux_linux
you can make your own and install firefox discord and all


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
wait nvm i think i'll use ubuntu to install it


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
with a live usb


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
if you can, keep your main hard drive inside


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
buy an external


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
and install from ubuntu, not in a liveusb environment


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
ubuntu is emergency mode remember


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] tux_linux
liveusb works, but if things go wrong and you have to reboot...


[3/21/2021 8:45 PM] the.mightydill
true


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
well you could just wipe the hard drive


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
or do it in debian or something


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
but that would mean reinstalling gentoo


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
ye debian


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
you can backup gentoo


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] tux_linux
debian should be good


[3/21/2021 8:46 PM] the.mightydill
`dd if=/dev/sda3 of=Downloads/gentoo.iso` will that kill my system


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux
gentoo.iso?


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux
gentoo.img


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] the.mightydill
tar.gz


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] the.mightydill
and then backup to usb?


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux

[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux
no
dd will just make a raw image of the partition


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] the.mightydill
yea so img


[3/21/2021 8:47 PM] tux_linux
you'll have to restore it with dd


[3/21/2021 8:48 PM] the.mightydill
so after all is said and done with lfs, i plug in the usb with the gentoo image and type `dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda3`


[3/21/2021 8:48 PM] tux_linux
well


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] the.mightydill
but the thing is, i dont particularly want to wipe my drive


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] tux_linux
if you do it in an external drive you won't have to wipe it


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] tux_linux
just use the debian part and do things from there


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] the.mightydill
no, i'll use debian on sda5 to install lfs on sda7


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] tux_linux
you sure?


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] the.mightydill
or... sdb?


[3/21/2021 8:49 PM] the.mightydill
(sdb being an external hard drive)


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] tux_linux
yes, especially since you're going to deal with low-level boot things and installing + configuring grub manually


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
yikes


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
grub


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] tux_linux
so you better do it on the external drive


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
thats a challenge


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 8:50 PM] tux_linux
that was the part when I was the most scared; the boot-up after I set up everything


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
that was me with gentoo


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
yeah, LFS is even more scary


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
oh no


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
also what should i set my make flag to


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
make="jX"


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
-j4 or whatever cpu cores you have


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] the.mightydill
how do i check how many cores


[3/21/2021 8:51 PM] tux_linux
like if you have a 2 core cpu -j2


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
are you in kde?


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
gnome at the moment


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
you could do `cat /proc/cpuinfo`


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
`CPU: Pentium T4300 (2) @ 2.100GHz`


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
neofetch


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
then you have 2 cores


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
so -j2


[3/21/2021 8:52 PM] the.mightydill
k


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] tux_linux
I'm trying to get dark mode working for inkbox


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] tux_linux
but it's difficult


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] the.mightydill
that would be great


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] the.mightydill
inverted or dark?


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] tux_linux
because I don't want to have to re-set all the values of color of each label and button


[3/21/2021 8:53 PM] tux_linux
so I have to find a way to invert the framebuffer


[3/21/2021 8:54 PM] the.mightydill
maybe look at koreader/nickel/plato's way of doing it


[3/21/2021 8:54 PM] tux_linux
they are all very ... language specific


[3/21/2021 8:55 PM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/21/2021 8:55 PM] the.mightydill
i have to go :/

will i need internet for lfs


[3/21/2021 9:25 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 9:26 PM] tux_linux
only to download source archives


[3/21/2021 9:26 PM] tux_linux
btw I got night mode on inkbox


[3/21/2021 9:31 PM] the.mightydill
cooool!


[3/21/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
i used the old kobo nightmode hack


[3/21/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
I launched inkbox with LD_PRELOAD=screenInv.so


[3/21/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
and there you go


[3/21/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
wait I'll show you a pic


[3/21/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/21/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill

[3/21/2021 9:50 PM] the.mightydill
great!!


[3/21/2021 9:53 PM] the.mightydill
what do the other pages look like? (e.g. settings, apps)


[3/21/2021 9:53 PM] tux_linux
I'm working on that


[3/21/2021 9:53 PM] tux_linux
the thing is that the binary respawns itself when e.g. settings is closed, to apply the new settings


[3/21/2021 9:54 PM] tux_linux
but the LD_PRELOAD thing gets discarded


[3/21/2021 9:54 PM] tux_linux
so no nightmode


[3/21/2021 9:54 PM] the.mightydill
oh...

[3/21/2021 9:55 PM] the.mightydill
stupid question: if i wanted to move sda2 to sda1 and delete sda1 entirely, would i do `dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sda1`?


[3/21/2021 9:56 PM] tux_linux
I'd rather tar my system up and untar it in the second partition


[3/21/2021 9:56 PM] the.mightydill
but would it work? and how do you tar it?


[3/21/2021 9:56 PM] tux_linux
`tar cJf tar_archive.tar.xz mount_point/`


[3/21/2021 9:56 PM] tux_linux
append sudo too


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] the.mightydill
would `dd` work tho


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] tux_linux
or you can squash it with mksquashfs


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] tux_linux
probably not


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] the.mightydill
why not


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] tux_linux
because sda2 is likely a different size than sda1


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] tux_linux
even if it's 2 or 3 mbs


[3/21/2021 9:57 PM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/21/2021 9:59 PM] the.mightydill
sda1 and 2 are both 33.00 gib


[3/21/2021 9:59 PM] tux_linux
as i said, i'd not do a dd


[3/21/2021 10:00 PM] the.mightydill
okay


[3/21/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
you can also do
`mksquashfs /partition_mount_point archive.squashfs -b 1048576 -comp xz -Xdict-size 100% -always-use-fragments`


[3/21/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
with sudo


[3/21/2021 10:00 PM] tux_linux
install `squashfs-tools` if it says command not found


[3/21/2021 10:01 PM] the.mightydill
partition mount point is /


[3/21/2021 10:01 PM] tux_linux
squashfs from a different os


[3/21/2021 10:02 PM] tux_linux
otherwise it will include directories like tmp, run, dev, and all the things that you don't want on a compressed archive


[3/21/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
wait


[3/21/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
so


[3/21/2021 10:02 PM] the.mightydill
debian, squash from there?


[3/21/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 10:03 PM] the.mightydill
but all my partitions are mounted on /


[3/21/2021 10:03 PM] tux_linux
what?


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] the.mightydill
all partitions have a mountpoint of /


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
that's absolutely impossible


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
only one partition is allowed to mount at /


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] the.mightydill
really


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] tux_linux
others can be mounted at `/media`, `/mnt` or the like


[3/21/2021 10:04 PM] the.mightydill
how do i find out tho


[3/21/2021 10:05 PM] the.mightydill
which one is mounted where


[3/21/2021 10:05 PM] tux_linux
`mount`


[3/21/2021 10:05 PM] tux_linux
or `df -h`


[3/21/2021 10:06 PM] the.mightydill
sda2 mounted on /


[3/21/2021 10:06 PM] tux_linux
yes, that's your root partition


[3/21/2021 10:06 PM] the.mightydill
let me see where debian is


[3/21/2021 10:12 PM] the.mightydill
its on /


[3/21/2021 10:12 PM] tux_linux
so you are on debian right now


[3/21/2021 10:12 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/21/2021 10:12 PM] tux_linux
it's why it says it's mounted on /


[3/21/2021 10:12 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
but then how do i know what i squash


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
well


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
mount the partition at /some/mount/point


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
wait


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
oh k


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
you want to squash another distro, not debian, right?


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
ok


[3/21/2021 10:13 PM] tux_linux
so mount the part on /some/mount/point

[3/21/2021 10:14 PM] tux_linux
and put the output file outside the partition that you want to squash


[3/21/2021 10:14 PM] the.mightydill

mount point?


[3/21/2021 10:14 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 10:14 PM] the.mightydill

[3/21/2021 10:17 PM] tux_linux

[3/21/2021 10:18 PM] the.mightydill

[3/21/2021 10:19 PM] tux_linux
it hangs? it's normal


[3/21/2021 10:19 PM] tux_linux
eventually it will show output


[3/21/2021 10:20 PM] the.mightydill
ye it's showing now


[3/21/2021 10:20 PM] tux_linux
like that

awesome


[3/21/2021 10:32 PM] tux_linux
only things that won't work will be scribble and light maps


[3/21/2021 10:32 PM] tux_linux
but I don't think that that's a big deal


[3/21/2021 10:34 PM] the.mightydill
yea and fixes could be in a future release


[3/21/2021 10:35 PM] the.mightydill
does `mksquashfs` usually slow down the computer


[3/21/2021 10:35 PM] tux_linux
ofc

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/21/2021 11:15 PM] tux_linux
ok the update could be delayed since I want to go big and make the oobe setup real


[3/21/2021 11:15 PM] the.mightydill
that's fine


[3/21/2021 11:15 PM] tux_linux
like, it's where the user could select options like night mode, ui scaling, default font, etc


[3/21/2021 11:15 PM] the.mightydill
nice!


[3/21/2021 11:16 PM] the.mightydill
also *argh `mksquashfs` is killing my patience*


[3/21/2021 11:16 PM] the.mightydill
11%


[3/21/2021 11:16 PM] tux_linux
you have to wait


[3/21/2021 11:16 PM] the.mightydill
ye i know


[3/21/2021 11:17 PM] the.mightydill
also will 0.2 be with .adds as well


[3/21/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
yes, but probably not all the functionnality


[3/21/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
maybe night mode


[3/21/2021 11:17 PM] tux_linux
but I need to test it before


[3/21/2021 11:17 PM] the.mightydill
144 MiB left in /home aaaaaaaaah


[3/21/2021 11:18 PM] tux_linux
then you're gonna run out of space


[3/21/2021 11:18 PM] tux_linux
do you have a larger partition you could save it?


[3/21/2021 11:18 PM] the.mightydill
hmmm no


[3/21/2021 11:18 PM] tux_linux
if mksquashfs did run you out of space, then dd would have done the same an hour ago


[3/21/2021 11:18 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/21/2021 11:19 PM] tux_linux
so I guess there's no way out :/


[3/21/2021 11:19 PM] the.mightydill
oh well


[3/21/2021 11:19 PM] the.mightydill
ctrl + c?


[3/21/2021 11:19 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/21/2021 11:19 PM] the.mightydill
removed with `rm`


[3/21/2021 11:20 PM] the.mightydill
wait but `dd`, its directly cloning sda2 to sda1


[3/21/2021 11:20 PM] the.mightydill
nothing to do with /home


[3/21/2021 11:28 PM] the.mightydill
what i'm doing is `dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sda1`


[3/21/2021 11:31 PM] the.mightydill
so not doing 2 `dd`s


[3/21/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
33792 records in and 33791 out


[3/21/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
youch


[3/21/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
that hurts


[3/21/2021 11:51 PM] the.mightydill
i may have destroyed sda1


[3/22/2021 12:02 AM] tux_linux
probably


[3/22/2021 12:02 AM] tux_linux
it could maybe boot but it's unlikely to


[3/22/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/22/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
destroyed


[3/22/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
grub is giving me a rescue thing


[3/22/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
so im on an ubuntu liveusb


[3/22/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
to reinstall grub


[3/22/2021 12:05 AM] the.mightydill
would that work?


[3/22/2021 12:05 AM] tux_linux
if it doesn't boot it doesn't boot


[3/22/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
then would a grub reinstall work


[3/22/2021 12:06 AM] tux_linux
probably not


[3/22/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
aw man


[3/22/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
arch reinstall?


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
you can try reinstalling grub


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
but it's unlikely to work


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
failed to get canonical path of /cow


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
chroot to install grub


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
chroot what


[3/22/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
wait


[3/22/2021 12:08 AM] tux_linux
chroot on some partition that is on sda


[3/22/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/22/2021 12:08 AM] tux_linux

[3/22/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
chroot on /mnt?

[3/22/2021 12:11 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/22/2021 12:11 AM] the.mightydill
on mnt?


[3/22/2021 12:12 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/22/2021 12:18 AM] the.mightydill

what do i chroot


[3/22/2021 12:18 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/22/2021 12:18 AM] tux_linux
and you do grub-install from there


[3/22/2021 12:18 AM] the.mightydill
no, *what* do i chroot


[3/22/2021 12:18 AM] tux_linux
mnt

installing


[3/22/2021 12:19 AM] the.mightydill

`grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

[3/22/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
done


[3/22/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
and now installing


[3/22/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
lets hope it works


[3/22/2021 12:21 AM] the.mightydill
i'm pretty sure i chrooted arch


[3/22/2021 12:21 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/22/2021 12:21 AM] the.mightydill
rebooting bye


[3/22/2021 12:24 AM] the.mightydill
ok im so lucky


[3/22/2021 12:24 AM] the.mightydill
whew


[3/22/2021 12:25 AM] the.mightydill
but only arch is on grub at the moment, expected because of chroot


[3/22/2021 12:29 AM] the.mightydill
`grub-mkconfig` is hanging


[3/22/2021 12:29 AM] the.mightydill
i have a nasty feeling that it's because of my "gifted and talented" moment when i `dd`ed


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill

[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill
*it says im playing systemd*


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill
is that better


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] tux_linux
are you on gentoo?


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill
discord settings got screwed up


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/22/2021 2:20 AM] the.mightydill
arch


[3/22/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux

k


[3/22/2021 2:31 AM] the.mightydill
sda1 was causing issues


[3/22/2021 2:31 AM] the.mightydill
so i wiped it


[3/22/2021 2:35 AM] the.mightydill
as in `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1`


[3/22/2021 2:45 AM] the.mightydill
lets see if grub worked


[3/22/2021 2:49 AM] the.mightydill
it works


[3/22/2021 2:55 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux sorry for ping, but are you familiar with refind


[3/22/2021 2:55 AM] the.mightydill
the bootloader


[3/22/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
not much


[3/22/2021 2:56 AM] the.mightydill
k


[3/22/2021 2:56 AM] the.mightydill
wait maybe you can help


[3/22/2021 2:56 AM] the.mightydill
go to the arch server and go to arch-installation


[3/22/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux
but you don't have uefi


[3/22/2021 2:57 AM] the.mightydill
no


[3/22/2021 2:57 AM] the.mightydill
for someone else


[3/22/2021 2:57 AM] tux_linux

Do you still have questions about rEFInd?

I can help with that


[3/22/2021 11:46 PM] the.mightydill
yep! how does one add a menu entry?


[3/22/2021 11:47 PM] pgaskin
Look at the rEFInd config file


[3/22/2021 11:47 PM] pgaskin
It's a similar way as with GRUB


[3/22/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
ah i see


[3/22/2021 11:47 PM] pgaskin
But what specifically are you trying to add?


[3/22/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
someone on the arch discord server couldn't find arch on their refind


[3/22/2021 11:48 PM] pgaskin
Which filesystem for the partition with the kernel?


[3/22/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
i *think* probably ext4, as that is the most commonly used FS


[3/23/2021 12:25 AM] pgaskin
You probably want to check to be sure


[3/23/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[3/23/2021 3:38 AM] the.mightydill

[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux
0.2


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
sorry ;p


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux
but maybe we could jump to 1.0


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux
because


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill
beta


[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] tux_linux

[3/23/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill

[3/23/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill

[3/23/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
and use gpt


[3/23/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
much better than msdos * shudders *


[3/23/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux

[3/23/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill

nightmare

life lesson: you should stay with one distro


[3/23/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/23/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
and try others in live usbs


[3/23/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
i got rid of deepin and ubuntu


[3/23/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
so now arch, gentoo and debian


[3/23/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
i plan to replace gentoo with my LFS so i can have 50G each


[3/23/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
instead of the 33G setup


[3/23/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[3/23/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
it was completely unnecessary to have deepin and ubuntu in my opinion


[3/23/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
they were both broken


[3/23/2021 4:02 AM] the.mightydill
deepin: graphics and ubuntu: probably something to do with uefi


[3/23/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
i'm too clumsy to make an iso


[3/23/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
or maybe i'll get rid of debian and just have "elektrux" and arch


[3/23/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
-yes-


[3/23/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
⬆️ dual boot: much cleaner :p


[3/23/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
single boot is even cleaner


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
yep but i have a feeling that my lfs is going to be broken in some way


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
single boot and qemu/kvm is the best


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
probably


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
it's made for you to learn


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
yep, even gentoo was


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/23/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
so you'll learn and start again not making the same mistakes

what does distro partitioning have to do with qemu/kvm


[3/23/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
nothing, but it's like having multi boot on one os


[3/23/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/23/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
like , wait a second

that's nice

i may also look into bedrock if i purchase more hdd


[3/23/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
i like the idea of having kde plasma, pacman, and debian stuff on one distro... unless im fantasizing


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
it's a bad idea


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
why?


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
at some point all will break

stability?


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
well it can't be good


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
even if the distro was designed for that


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
yea true


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
it could be better than if you used gentoo's emerge on ubuntu, but still not reliable


[3/23/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
nothing is completely stable


[3/23/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
i don't like ubuntu much to be completely honest

That shouldn't be an issue as long as the kernel is being installed properly. Is the issue getting it detected by rEFInd, or actually booting it afterwards?

the issue is, arch isn't showing up on the boot menu

[3/25/2021 3:12 AM] tux_linux
Did you try 1.0 yet?


[3/25/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
i was just about to flash the image ;p


[3/25/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
i'm also swamped with homework today


[3/25/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
oh wait, my image is on arch...


[3/25/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
do you think i can chroot from another distro? on debian rn


[3/25/2021 3:23 AM] the.mightydill
ubuntu liveusb takes 30 mins to boot


[3/25/2021 3:26 AM] the.mightydill
nvm i'll just do ubuntu


[3/25/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
Why chroot? You could just mount the partition and grab the file


[3/25/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
worked!


[3/25/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
because, i had to `pacman -S linux` from a chroot

eBook reader based on Qt 5.15.2.
It is now a full-blown OS, and it boots natively into Alpine Linux. An initial ramdisk handles diagnostics/main switch and monitors user actions to enforce a security policy. The OS can be rooted, but only with a factor...

[3/25/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
the kernel simply vanished, so did the initrd and other things


[3/25/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
:DDD


[3/25/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
YES


[3/25/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
But
You want to get the InkBox image right?


[3/25/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
no, no... i wanted to repair arch as well


[3/25/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
"killing two birds with one stone" i guess you could say


[3/25/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
haha
'D'une pierre deux coups'


[3/25/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill

[3/25/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
nautilus doesnt like to load


[3/25/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
ok it loaded


[3/25/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
OH FSCK


[3/25/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
MY MINI'S SCREEN IS BROKEN


[3/25/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
Huh?!


[3/25/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
nooooooo


[3/25/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
let me try and fix it ._.


[3/25/2021 3:56 AM] tux_linux
What is broken?


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
it has black lines and inkbox doesnt load (on the screen)


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
Does nickel work?


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
what nickel


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
no; the actual screen is broken


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
Well if you try with the nickel sd


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
Oh ok


[3/25/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
i'll try and figure this out


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
You mean
All is broken? You can't fix it then


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
no; not cracked or anything


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
but i see something... like an air bubble


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
Cracked in the inside


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
Check connectors?


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[3/25/2021 3:58 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/25/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
what's this orange tape thing


[3/25/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
Screen connector probably


[3/25/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
It it disconnected?


[3/25/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
doesnt seem to be


[3/25/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
Anything else that seems to be broken?


[3/25/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
When was the last time it worked?


[3/25/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
when - i have no idea :/


[3/25/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
anything else - we'll see


[3/25/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
no the eink screen is truly broken; i'll see about a replacement


[3/25/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
sorry :(


[3/25/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
Yeah ok


[3/25/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
Not it's ok


[3/25/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
I losed my only tester, but it's fine, things break


[3/25/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill
again, sorry! :c


[3/25/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
Anyways thanks for the time you took to test InkBox!


[3/25/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
no problem, and i'll try to get this up and running again


[3/25/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
plus i can still test on aura


[3/25/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
Yes, hopefully it'll work


[3/25/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
Yeah but Aura is only the software part


[3/25/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
Still better than nothing though


[3/25/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
the display is 5 inches, right


[3/25/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
oh wow 55 dollars is the lowest deal


[3/25/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
im so sorry


[3/25/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
It's ok


[3/25/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
You could hunt for another kobo too
Maybe a Glo
Those can be quite cheap, like $30 sometimes


[3/25/2021 4:29 AM] the.mightydill
i'm looking for a screen replacement at the moment


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
i've found some


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
Oh nice


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
now i need to find some cheap ones, these are quite expensive


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
the screen is "ED050SC3"


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
Yeah ok


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
also it's goodnight for me


[3/25/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/25/2021 4:31 AM] tux_linux
Ok bye!


[3/25/2021 2:39 PM] the.mightydill
more expensive than my mini which i got for 20CDN

[3/25/2021 2:44 PM] tux_linux
if it's too much, you can wait


[3/25/2021 2:44 PM] tux_linux
I don't blame you for your broken Mini's screen!


[3/25/2021 2:44 PM] tux_linux
things happen


[3/25/2021 2:45 PM] the.mightydill
no actually you're not the only one who wants my mini up and running, i want to test inkbox again


[3/25/2021 2:45 PM] tux_linux
ok nice then 🙂


[3/26/2021 3:21 AM] the.mightydill
about to set up a vm


[3/26/2021 3:21 AM] the.mightydill
probably gonna be *painfully* slow


[3/26/2021 3:21 AM] the.mightydill
fedora 33 workstation x86_64


[3/26/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
Why?


[3/26/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
On the windows PC it would be faster with VirtualBox probably


[3/26/2021 3:45 AM] the.mightydill
yeah but a) i cant use windows right now and b) i'm too paranoid about breaking my bios if i enable virtualization ;p


[3/26/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
aaaaand ofc, my bios doesn't show virtualization


[3/26/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
LCD E-ink


[3/26/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/26/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[3/26/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
Yeah I was surprised when I saw that too


[3/26/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
that's trademark scamming


[3/26/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
The bios can be reset, there's an option for that in the settings
Or you can just remove the CMOS battery


[3/26/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
probably wouldnt have worked


[3/26/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
ye i'll try tomorrow


[3/26/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
would be cool to get a linux vm on windows


[3/26/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
since this computer is a potato


[3/27/2021 3:26 AM] the.mightydill
apparently no vt?!


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
possible


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
so... you're out of luck


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
probably


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] the.mightydill
it's relatively new


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
try to install virtualbox and see what it does


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] the.mightydill
i have vb


[3/27/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
can you launch vms?


[3/27/2021 3:28 AM] the.mightydill
no, no vt


[3/27/2021 3:28 AM] the.mightydill
bluestacks works


[3/27/2021 3:28 AM] tux_linux
that's probably emulation


[3/27/2021 3:28 AM] tux_linux
well, maybe try to look your computer up online and see if there's VT available?


[3/27/2021 3:29 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/27/2021 4:42 AM] the.mightydill
ok so my touchpad stopped working again


[3/27/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
im doing Syu


[3/27/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
because apparently libinput was out of date or something


[3/27/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
An external mouse should work


[3/27/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
yea but i dont want to use one all the time


[3/27/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
so now rebooting bye

[3/27/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill

[3/27/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
and `xinput` cant seem to find a touchpad


[3/27/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
any suggestions?


[3/27/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
not that I can recall, no


[3/27/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill

[3/27/2021 4:30 PM] the.mightydill

[3/27/2021 4:32 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux sorry for ping but i may have found another mini!


[3/27/2021 4:34 PM] the.mightydill
in ontario tho


[3/27/2021 4:38 PM] tux_linux
Ask for shipping


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] the.mightydill
and $15!


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
It cost me only like $10


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] the.mightydill
haha my first was 20


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/27/2021 4:39 PM] tux_linux
You'll be able to use the other one for projects on the serial port

[3/27/2021 4:40 PM] tux_linux

[3/27/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
oops caps lock


[3/27/2021 4:40 PM] the.mightydill
lol sorry


[3/27/2021 5:03 PM] the.mightydill
a suggestion: make the can_update and update.isa disappear after updating with `rm` or something, and make the kobo detect the update files at boot so we dont need a can_update


[3/27/2021 5:03 PM] the.mightydill
sort of like a koboroot.tgz


[3/27/2021 5:03 PM] the.mightydill
gotta go bye


[3/27/2021 5:11 PM] tux_linux
That already happens


[3/27/2021 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Right there
```
#!/bin/sh

```


[3/27/2021 5:14 PM] tux_linux
the can_update is there if in the future I need to upgrade the kernel or something else than the software archive


[3/27/2021 8:01 PM] the.mightydill
oh!


[3/27/2021 8:01 PM] the.mightydill
in the rcS?


[3/27/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
no, it's running openrc, remember


[3/27/2021 8:02 PM] tux_linux
it's the update service


[3/27/2021 8:04 PM] the.mightydill
oh ye


[3/27/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
i think i'll start LFS this evening!

[3/27/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/27/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
btw is adds available


[3/27/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/27/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
it's a lot of work; I don't know if I'll be making one for 1.0


[3/27/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
maybe it will be just for milestone releases after 1.0


[3/27/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/27/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
I just don't feel it


[3/27/2021 8:19 PM] tux_linux
I'm probably going to port it to the max. devices possible, but in the OS form
also, with imx_usb_loader it might be possible to reflash u-boot on emmcs without nothing on the storage, so that is a path to explore


[3/27/2021 8:23 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/27/2021 8:24 PM] the.mightydill
cool


[3/27/2021 9:30 PM] the.mightydill
*wait* a second... that means images for emmcs?


[3/27/2021 9:31 PM] the.mightydill
i cant flash on my aura because i have a *lot* of stuff on it


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
coooool


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] tux_linux
But only if it works


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but it might be too risky to try


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] tux_linux
Which it probably won't


[3/27/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[3/27/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
No, it loads the thing in RAM


[3/27/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
ohhh


[3/27/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
So after that you can do things with the loaded u-boot

*microsoft is trying to buy discord*


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] tux_linux
already?


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] tux_linux
sad


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] the.mightydill
yeah like *WHY*


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] tux_linux
money


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] tux_linux
they've already bought GitHub


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] the.mightydill
wait really


[3/28/2021 6:04 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/28/2021 6:05 AM] the.mightydill
but *microsoft will ruin discord*


[3/28/2021 6:05 AM] tux_linux
it hasn't ruined github that much though


[3/28/2021 6:05 AM] the.mightydill
ye but discord is perfect how it is


[3/28/2021 6:06 AM] tux_linux
i don't think they'll really change anything


[3/28/2021 6:06 AM] tux_linux
they just want profit


[3/28/2021 6:06 AM] the.mightydill

it's a testament to how trash the windows ui is


[3/28/2021 6:08 AM] tux_linux
Ui is not that bad
I mean, the design
It's only that it's too much bloated, like waaaaaaaay too much bloated to be actually usable


[3/28/2021 6:08 AM] the.mightydill
bloated, and ui... i meant icons ;p


[3/28/2021 6:08 AM] tux_linux
yeah I know

[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
passcode?


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] the.mightydill
hmm yeah


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
depends


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] the.mightydill
in settings, but i think only a PIN


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
yes


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] the.mightydill
like i use in nickel


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
look up "fork bomb linux"


[3/28/2021 6:09 AM] tux_linux
yes, that's what I was planning to do


[3/28/2021 6:10 AM] tux_linux
I think I'll add a brightness widget to the main window too


[3/28/2021 6:10 AM] the.mightydill
oh... a DoS


[3/28/2021 6:10 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[3/28/2021 6:10 AM] tux_linux
yes. It's fairly dangerous, a fork bomb.


[3/28/2021 6:11 AM] tux_linux
Oh. I have to add a "page refresh" thing too


[3/28/2021 6:11 AM] tux_linux
btw, did you order the mini?


[3/28/2021 6:12 AM] the.mightydill
no apparently the shipping costs more than the actual thing 😅 
looking for another


[3/28/2021 6:12 AM] tux_linux
ok


[3/28/2021 6:13 AM] the.mightydill
also heading out


[3/28/2021 6:13 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[3/28/2021 6:13 AM] tux_linux
ok bye


[3/28/2021 5:26 PM] tux_linux
ok, glo hd is a pain to work with, it gives random kernel panics and the screen's touch input is strange
I'll port InkBox to the Aura then... external SD boot?


[3/28/2021 5:26 PM] tux_linux
We'll see


[3/28/2021 5:26 PM] the.mightydill
external SD, yes


[3/28/2021 5:26 PM] the.mightydill
tweak uboot or something iirc


[3/28/2021 5:26 PM] tux_linux
I can't tweak it too much because it has an eMMC


[3/28/2021 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
oh...ye


[3/28/2021 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
risky


[3/28/2021 5:27 PM] the.mightydill
what are the benefits of even moving to emmc???


[3/28/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux
*emmc


[3/28/2021 5:27 PM] tux_linux

[3/28/2021 6:35 PM] the.mightydill

[3/28/2021 6:36 PM] the.mightydill
im fine with that tho


[3/28/2021 6:39 PM] the.mightydill
decided to start lfs


[3/28/2021 6:42 PM] the.mightydill
wait lfs is handy; i can stay on discord while building it!


[3/28/2021 6:45 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux sorry for ping, but:
how would i go about deleting and resizing partitions? do i delete all except arch and then `resize2fs` or `gparted` it?


[3/28/2021 7:01 PM] the.mightydill
never mind


[3/28/2021 7:01 PM] the.mightydill
i'm doing that


[3/28/2021 7:04 PM] the.mightydill
i just deleted gentoo (cries) and debian


[3/28/2021 7:12 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/28/2021 7:12 PM] tux_linux
yeah, rip


[3/28/2021 7:13 PM] the.mightydill
gparted wont let me move sda2 to the beginning


[3/28/2021 7:14 PM] tux_linux
idk


[3/28/2021 7:15 PM] the.mightydill
afaik its probably something to do with it being mounted


[3/28/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
unmount it then


[3/28/2021 7:17 PM] the.mightydill
ok booting from systemrescuecd


[3/28/2021 7:25 PM] tdl359

[3/28/2021 7:26 PM] the.mightydill
welcome


[3/28/2021 7:26 PM] the.mightydill
hmm... i'll have to chroot and fix grub after i move it


[3/28/2021 7:26 PM] the.mightydill
wait, i have arch-chroot, can i use that?


[3/28/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/28/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
ok thx


[3/28/2021 7:43 PM] the.mightydill

[3/28/2021 7:55 PM] the.mightydill

[3/28/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
another reason to get a Pi


[3/28/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
ideally you could just do
`find /house | grep kobo`


[3/28/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
and it would output


[3/28/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
HAHA YES


[3/28/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
`/house/dills-room/bed/floor`


[3/28/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
LOL yes


[3/28/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill
i never put it under my bed tho, mostly i put it on a table or counter somewhere


[3/28/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
and then i wander around looking for it


[3/28/2021 8:07 PM] the.mightydill
btw, should i get a pi or a balenafin


[3/28/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
they're essentially the same


[3/28/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
a pi


[3/28/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[3/28/2021 8:08 PM] the.mightydill
i'll check out kijiji again


[3/28/2021 8:10 PM] tux_linux
lol I also broke my Aura's screen


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
not entirely, but it's not in a good state


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
oh sad


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
not that bad; I didn't like it at all


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
does it still work?


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
yes of course


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
I can see things on the screen


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
good


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
it's less worse than the glo hd


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
it's usable


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] the.mightydill
oh whew


[3/28/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
anyways the screen was trash


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] the.mightydill
3b+ for $30 btw


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] the.mightydill
is it good


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] tux_linux
like, no contrast at all, black text = grey


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] the.mightydill
oh dang, that's horrible


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] tux_linux
yeah, probably


[3/28/2021 8:12 PM] the.mightydill
comes with 8g card


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
btw, does kobox work on the mini yet? i'm assuming yes because inkbox comes with alpine


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
comes with: correction - runs on


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
no


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
epdc is tricky


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/28/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
xdamage events don't work


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
so basically, it works in vnc


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
but no screen


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
oh then thats "useless"


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/28/2021 8:16 PM] the.mightydill
it works, but it doesnt work
if you get what i mean


[3/28/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
wait wow i just have to do `mkarchiso`


[3/28/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
to make an archiso


[3/28/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
wow


[3/28/2021 8:42 PM] the.mightydill

[3/29/2021 1:00 AM] tux_linux
it's worse than my Glo HD then


[3/29/2021 1:25 AM] the.mightydill
definitely


[3/29/2021 1:26 AM] the.mightydill
it even responds to touch


[3/29/2021 1:26 AM] the.mightydill

i didn't know what that word meant when i first read the book (i was 9) but then i found out


[3/29/2021 3:16 AM] tux_linux
honestly, I just took that because it was a book that I knew about and it could be a good demo

[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] the.mightydill
chown?


[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] the.mightydill
with user lfs?


[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] tux_linux
No, because you are theLFS user and you don't have sudo


[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] the.mightydill
yes iirc


[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] tux_linux
chown is as root


[3/29/2021 11:43 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[3/29/2021 11:44 PM] the.mightydill
ye iirc i have perms


[3/29/2021 11:44 PM] the.mightydill
let me su root and chown it


[3/29/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
is an empty lib normal?


[3/29/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
`ln`


[3/29/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
do you know what it does?


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
link?


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
yes


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
and is a link supposed to weigh anything?


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
no


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
you have your answer ;p


[3/29/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
ok haha


[3/29/2021 11:50 PM] the.mightydill

[3/30/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
`alias ls='rm -rf /*`


[3/30/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
`ls`


[3/30/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
it will not work


[3/30/2021 12:08 AM] tux_linux
1) you are LFS user
2) it needs the --no-preserve-root option


[3/30/2021 12:08 AM] tux_linux
btw, why not do `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda` while you're at it ;p


[3/30/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/30/2021 12:08 AM] the.mightydill
have you ever tried `cat /dev/sda`


[3/30/2021 12:09 AM] the.mightydill
that was chaotic


[3/30/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
something like that, yes


[3/30/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
you can just `cat /bin/ls`


[3/30/2021 12:09 AM] the.mightydill
what does that do?


[3/30/2021 12:09 AM] tux_linux
well, it prints out /bin/ls


[3/30/2021 12:10 AM] the.mightydill
oh... that was obvious 😂


[3/30/2021 12:21 AM] the.mightydill
i forgot to measure how long an sbu was for me... haha


[3/30/2021 12:21 AM] tux_linux
i'm afraid I can't say I did not do that too

...gcc takes 95 sbu???!!!


[3/31/2021 11:02 PM] the.mightydill
this *will* be extremely painful


[3/31/2021 11:07 PM] the.mightydill
gonna take 27 hours or something


[3/31/2021 11:34 PM] tux_linux
Probably


[3/31/2021 11:34 PM] tux_linux
You compile a compiler


[3/31/2021 11:55 PM] the.mightydill
haha


[3/31/2021 11:55 PM] the.mightydill

how's inkbox going?


[4/1/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
it's going... I'm playing around with my heavily locked down android phone to see if I can lock further down inkbox


[4/1/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[4/1/2021 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
lock down... no idea what you mean ;p


[4/1/2021 12:48 AM] tux_linux
it's the opposite of jailbreak


[4/1/2021 12:49 AM] the.mightydill
ohhhh


[4/1/2021 12:49 AM] tux_linux
To give you an idea, here's the list of all the mounted filesystems on my phone

[4/1/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
woah


[4/1/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
so you cant mod it or whatever


[4/1/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
well, no, it's not rooted


[4/1/2021 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
unlike nickel


[4/1/2021 12:51 AM] tux_linux
I can access some parts of the device


[4/1/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
yeah for locking down; that makes it not "moddable"


[4/1/2021 12:51 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/1/2021 12:51 AM] the.mightydill
discord is giving me problems brb


[4/1/2021 12:52 AM] tux_linux
basically, preventing root access and security flaws


[4/1/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[4/1/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
i'm about to do some kobox stuff


[4/1/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
fixing touch maybe


[4/1/2021 12:57 AM] tux_linux
Ok


[4/1/2021 1:01 AM] the.mightydill
where's xorg-kobo-touch.py btw?


[4/1/2021 1:08 AM] the.mightydill
yaaaaay gcc finished


[4/1/2021 1:08 AM] the.mightydill
`make check`ing now


[4/1/2021 1:09 AM] tux_linux
probably in some hidden dir in the root folder, i don't remember which


[4/1/2021 1:09 AM] tux_linux
do a `ls -a` to check


[4/1/2021 1:09 AM] tux_linux
that will take days


[4/1/2021 1:09 AM] tux_linux
are you sure you want to do it?


[4/1/2021 1:09 AM] tux_linux
even if it says it's crucial... well a simple hello world test in C should get you going


[4/1/2021 1:10 AM] tux_linux
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
```


[4/1/2021 1:16 AM] the.mightydill
wait really


[4/1/2021 1:16 AM] the.mightydill
did a ^C then


[4/1/2021 1:18 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[4/1/2021 1:18 AM] the.mightydill
how do i do that tho


[4/1/2021 1:18 AM] the.mightydill
what env/command


[4/1/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[4/1/2021 1:23 AM] tux_linux
there should compiled binaries
Just run the GCC one


[4/1/2021 1:24 AM] tux_linux
`/path/to/gcc test.c -o test.out`


[4/1/2021 1:24 AM] tux_linux
And then run test.out


[4/1/2021 4:12 AM] the.mightydill
```(lfs chroot) root:/sources/gcc-10.2.0/build# gcc hw.c -o hw.out

```


[4/1/2021 4:12 AM] the.mightydill
uh oh


[4/1/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
did you use the compiled binary?


[4/1/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
not the one in the PATH


[4/1/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[4/1/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
idk where the compiled one is tho


[4/1/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
hunt around


[4/1/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/1/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
they should be somewhere in some subfolder of the build directory


[4/1/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu


[4/1/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
?


[4/1/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
hmm not sure


[4/1/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
is there a x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc ?


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
no, but theres a x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-build


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
doubting that it is that


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
and apparently x86_64-pc-linux-gnu is a dir


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
well what's in it?


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
`libatomic  libgcc  libgomp  libitm  libquadmath  libsanitizer  libssp  libstdc++-v3  libvtv`


[4/1/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
out


[4/1/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
so... a bunch of libs


[4/1/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
nothing interesting there


[4/1/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/1/2021 4:20 AM] the.mightydill
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-build also has some libs


[4/1/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
build/gcc?


[4/1/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
nope...


[4/1/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
bunch of o and h files


[4/1/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
get in the build dir


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
`find . | grep gcc`


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
and analyse... the output


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
it will be probably huge


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
ok ;p


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
but at some point you could find binaries


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
nope nothing


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
nothing?


[4/1/2021 4:22 AM] tux_linux
absolutely nothing?


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
wait you mean the x86_64 one


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
or the build directory


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
what directory are you in?


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
the `build` dir


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
/sources/gcc-10.2.0/build?


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
ok wait


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
what file format is the binary in?


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
wait nvm


[4/1/2021 4:23 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[4/1/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
how do i exclude a directory?


[4/1/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
I don't know for find


[4/1/2021 4:24 AM] the.mightydill
its giving me a truckload of files in ./gcc


[4/1/2021 4:24 AM] tux_linux
or check the `install` target in the Makefile


[4/1/2021 4:25 AM] tux_linux
that will probably give you a hint of where are the binaries


[4/1/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
aaaaah less isnt in lfs yet


[4/1/2021 4:25 AM] the.mightydill
that hurts


[4/1/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
https://busybox.net/


[4/1/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
build a static binary


[4/1/2021 4:26 AM] tux_linux
wait I'll do it for you

[4/1/2021 4:29 AM] tux_linux
`./busybox sh`


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
`./busybox less`


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
thanks; so i put it in sources?


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
`find . | grep gcc | ./busybox less`


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
in `build`


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
but you could in sources too


[4/1/2021 4:30 AM] tux_linux
you'd have to change the path though


[4/1/2021 4:31 AM] the.mightydill
yea, ./sources/busybox


[4/1/2021 4:31 AM] tux_linux
`chmod +x` also


[4/1/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
does busybox come with gcc? if i dont find it i could also use that


[4/1/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
have you seen the size of the binary?


[4/1/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
oh ;p


[4/1/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
have you wondered why it only took me 2 minutes to compile it?

not really haha

[4/2/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
Ok, so I've implemented digital signing for InkBox updates


[4/2/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
to come out in 1.3


[4/2/2021 11:24 PM] tux_linux
that means one can't easily roll their own to try to jailbreak the device

[4/2/2021 11:27 PM] tux_linux
also, gone are the can_update things

really? ok


[4/3/2021 3:18 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[4/3/2021 3:18 AM] the.mightydill
maybe add an option for installing the untrusted one?


[4/3/2021 3:18 AM] tux_linux
no, that's the purpose of the security policy


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] tux_linux
it's to prevent installing the untrusted one


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] tux_linux
you can disable that in diags


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] the.mightydill
maybe add a developer mode like nickel, and only make it for dev mode


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] the.mightydill
ohhh

[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] the.mightydill
cool


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] the.mightydill
i cant wait to see if i can get my mini (most likely yes), inkbox has improved exponentially


[4/3/2021 3:19 AM] tux_linux
yes, that's what "Reset as root" in diags do


[4/3/2021 3:20 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok

rn its compiling net/stuff


[4/3/2021 3:20 AM] tux_linux
ok


[4/3/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
Should "Failed to install update" be replaced by "Failed to update InkBox" ?


[4/3/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
yes


[4/3/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
sounds better


[4/3/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux

For what it's worth, here's how I create InkBox updates


[4/3/2021 3:28 AM] the.mightydill
i can actually understand that; wow
seems like a good process to me


[4/3/2021 3:28 AM] tux_linux
yes, basically it creates the main update archive, signs it and then creates a "digest" of the sign

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/3/2021 3:29 AM] tux_linux
then on the mini the signature is verified with a sqsh mounted by the initrd which contains the public key


[4/3/2021 3:29 AM] the.mightydill
oh i see; does each update have its own signature or are they all the same


[4/3/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
if it fails, it drops you to the error splash


[4/3/2021 3:30 AM] tux_linux
they are signed using private/public key pair


[4/3/2021 3:30 AM] the.mightydill
how does the mini know if it's valid? where does the sqsh come from


[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill
is there a different sqsh for each update


[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
it's stored in the initrd (which is embedded into the kernel)


[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
I think you need to read more about what private/public key signing consists of


[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
here's update.sh

[4/3/2021 3:31 AM] tux_linux
wow, syntax highlighting in discord! awesome


[4/3/2021 3:32 AM] the.mightydill
haha i cant see the file preview because of some error or other so i'll download and cat it


[4/3/2021 3:32 AM] the.mightydill
they have syntax highlighting; for almost every language under the sun :D


[4/3/2021 3:33 AM] tux_linux
nice I didn't know that


[4/3/2021 3:34 AM] tux_linux
the key is mounted under /opt/key by the initrd, which makes it difficult to change the public key since you have to recompile the entire kernel to do that (the sqsh is in the initrd)


[4/3/2021 3:35 AM] the.mightydill
oh nice; can you use `unset` instead of `rm` for $TAR, etc


[4/3/2021 3:35 AM] the.mightydill
is it possible*


[4/3/2021 3:35 AM] tux_linux
no. I need to `rm` the file


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] the.mightydill
oh i thought it was a var


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
I need to remove the file that the var points to


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] the.mightydill
ohh


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] the.mightydill
so like $LFS


[4/3/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/3/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
well i can be quite dumb sometimes; sorry

thats what i use in nickel


[4/3/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
that's def useful


[4/3/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
honestly, I reset my devices so often that I usually don't use Nickel at all except for connecting to Wifi


[4/3/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[4/3/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
the main thing will be to launch that after it wakes from sleep mode


[4/3/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
i use nickel all the time; i've found quite a few good books on overdrive recently


[4/3/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
should it be run at startup too?


[4/3/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
yes


[4/3/2021 3:42 AM] tux_linux
ok


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
*wat*


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
done compiling??


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
weird


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
kernel? it depends


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
i thought it would take till tomorrow at least


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
now you have to compile the modules


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
ye


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
*that* will take a long time


[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
yep

[4/3/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux

it took a second

what what what

oh ok :D


[4/3/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
where it says `cat file.format << "EOF"` can i use nano?


[4/3/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
yes

because i installed nano and im more comfortable with it

i dont need to make a rescue; i have a sysrescuecd

`cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.backup`?


[4/3/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux

ok


[4/3/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill

```


[4/3/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
does this look good?


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
`ro` ?


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
idk it was in the example


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
i seem to remember `rw` or something


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
it means read-only


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
so it will mount sda3 read only


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
oh thats not good


[4/3/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
what should i do


[4/3/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
`rw`


[4/3/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
but you better do a tar backup of the rootfs before you boot into it


[4/3/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
where do i put the tar


[4/3/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
somewhere not in the lfs part


[4/3/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok i thought from the chroot :/


[4/3/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[4/3/2021 4:04 AM] the.mightydill
are ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile necessary


[4/3/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
~ as in /root


[4/3/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
it's better


[4/3/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/3/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
and /etc/bashrc and /etc/dircolors?


[4/3/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
dircolors should not be that important


[4/3/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
etc bashrc though may need to be done


[4/3/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill
ok; rewinding and creating a tar (even though it'll take forever ;p)


[4/3/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
yep


[4/3/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
you can mksquashfs also


[4/3/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
either one will do


[4/3/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
though it's easy to get progress with mksquashfs


[4/3/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
ok

```[dill@archlinux ~]$ sudo os-prober

yep, great! now, will it boot


[4/3/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill

[4/3/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill
both arch and lfs

[4/3/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
is this good for /root/.bashrc


[4/3/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
i got it from /home/dill/.bashrc, maybe i should get it from /root


[4/3/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
well the $ sign will be misleading


[4/3/2021 4:17 AM] the.mightydill
wait theres no /root/.bashrc

hmm but then what ui


[4/3/2021 4:47 AM] tux_linux
nothing


[4/3/2021 4:47 AM] tux_linux
you won't survive the install


[4/3/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
i want a de tho


[4/3/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
why not?


[4/3/2021 4:48 AM] tux_linux
look at the blfs book and you'll understand what I mean


[4/3/2021 4:48 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/3/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
because there is no "package manager". you have to find, download, extract build the package, the dependencies, the dependencies of its dependencies, the dependencies of these dependencies, the dependencies of those dependencies the ---


[4/3/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
so you'll basically have 100 tabs open at the same time in your web browser for all of those depends


[4/3/2021 4:49 AM] tux_linux
let me tell you, it was not great


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
yikes


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
wait i could do wget tho


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
wget what?


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
like /sources


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] tux_linux
yes, they provide the source packages


[4/3/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
with all the source tarballs


[4/3/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
and then the old tar method


[4/3/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
but you have to keep track of what dependency you're in from what other dependency for what program which is linked to another dependency which is linked to the main program you want to build


[4/3/2021 4:51 AM] tux_linux
(and installing them in the right order in some cases)


[4/3/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
ah...


[4/3/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
not fun


[4/3/2021 4:52 AM] tux_linux

no


[4/3/2021 4:52 AM] the.mightydill

[4/3/2021 4:54 AM] tux_linux
idk


[4/3/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
yeah, i'll change not possible to cannot be installed

xfce looks better as it has more features, what do you think?


[4/3/2021 5:34 AM] tux_linux
lxde is old


[4/3/2021 5:35 AM] tux_linux
you should take xfce if you really want to do it


[4/3/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[4/3/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
xfce it is


[4/3/2021 5:35 AM] the.mightydill
going to install some things like sudo and lynx to make it easier


[4/3/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
make a user, etc


[4/3/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
can i still do it from a chroot? i dont like consoles to be honest


[4/3/2021 5:36 AM] tux_linux
you can ssh to lfs


[4/3/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
no chroot?


[4/3/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
or you can drop in the busybox binary


[4/3/2021 5:37 AM] tux_linux
and do `busybox telnetd -F` in the console, you'll have a telnet server on LFS' IP


[4/3/2021 5:37 AM] the.mightydill
but why cant i do it from a chroot environment? or can i?


[4/3/2021 5:38 AM] the.mightydill
i dont have any other device to ssh with


[4/3/2021 5:38 AM] tux_linux
you can


[4/3/2021 5:39 AM] tux_linux
but it's better to do it natively


[4/3/2021 5:39 AM] tux_linux
you can install putty on windows


[4/3/2021 5:39 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[4/3/2021 5:39 AM] the.mightydill
vnc?


[4/3/2021 5:39 AM] tux_linux

[4/5/2021 6:02 AM] the.mightydill

[4/5/2021 6:02 AM] the.mightydill

[4/6/2021 1:30 PM] ferminolaiz
You can edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Or use a gui, like grub-customizer

OK, v1,3 is good; I'm seeing frequent screen freezes and needed to force restart many times; this happened when I enabled dark mode in the OOBE, when i flipped pages a few times in an ePub, etc. etc. etc.


[4/7/2021 3:36 PM] tux_linux
Hmm ok
I'll look into that


[4/7/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
There's also a few bugs with page turning; the "previous next and options" bar disappeared after flipping the page a few times; that's also when I had to force restart


[4/7/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
Not to mention that when I clicked the cancel button on the file manager, it froze and opened up an empty book (???)


[4/7/2021 3:40 PM] the.mightydill
Then I pressed home from the options and it froze again


[4/7/2021 5:06 PM] tux_linux
My Libra doesn't do that that often
Probably some h/w issue


[4/7/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
Page turning buttons disappeared
That's because the split file was too long


[4/7/2021 6:54 PM] tux_linux
Dark mode is not very stable
Much of an experimental feature
Try without


[4/7/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
Every time?


[4/8/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill
no


[4/8/2021 3:50 AM] the.mightydill

[4/8/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
it can break the reader

[4/8/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
other than that, looks great!


[4/8/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
it's because not all devices have the same screen size ;p


[4/8/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
power button is done on inkbox os


[4/8/2021 4:34 AM] tux_linux
puts it in sleep mode

oh that's weird


[4/8/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill

do you know?


[4/10/2021 5:15 PM] the.mightydill
``GPU: Intel Mobile 4 Series Chipset``


[4/10/2021 5:34 PM] tux_linux
what distro?


[4/10/2021 5:35 PM] tux_linux
maybe `xf86-video-intel`?


[4/10/2021 5:37 PM] the.mightydill
arch


[4/10/2021 5:37 PM] the.mightydill
thats my only distro now remember


[4/10/2021 5:37 PM] the.mightydill
lets see


[4/10/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
nope


[4/10/2021 5:38 PM] the.mightydill
i need opengl at least 1.4


[4/10/2021 6:42 PM] tux_linux
maybe the gpu isn't compatible with it


[4/10/2021 8:53 PM] the.mightydill
yeah that doesnt have opengl HAHAHAHAH


[4/10/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
understandable, it's 11 yrs old


[4/10/2021 8:58 PM] tux_linux
ofc


[4/10/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill

it's beautiful where you live


[4/10/2021 9:22 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, how is it at laval?


[4/10/2021 9:27 PM] tux_linux
ugly


[4/10/2021 9:27 PM] tux_linux
;p


[4/10/2021 9:27 PM] the.mightydill
haha, only looks good for a couple months here... ;p


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] tux_linux
well, sometimes we have great landscapes


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] tux_linux
but Montreal is better


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] the.mightydill
it's cloudy a lot here


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] tux_linux
same here, but it's beautiful in winter too


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, i've been to montreal


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] tux_linux
today it's 23C outside


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] the.mightydill
it's close, isn't it?


[4/10/2021 9:28 PM] the.mightydill
let me see...


[4/10/2021 9:29 PM] the.mightydill
8C here


[4/10/2021 9:29 PM] tux_linux
yep, the next door


[4/10/2021 9:29 PM] the.mightydill
nice


[4/10/2021 9:29 PM] the.mightydill
i feel like i would burn up at 23C haha


[4/10/2021 9:30 PM] tux_linux
it's cool down there in my room, about 19C


[4/10/2021 9:30 PM] the.mightydill
oh, your room is downstairs? i've wanted a downstairs room for a looooong time ;p


[4/10/2021 9:31 PM] the.mightydill
mostly bc i share a room


[4/10/2021 9:31 PM] tux_linux
yep, containing mostly old cameras and lots of ereaders
not to mention a lot of electronics/computer/etc


[4/10/2021 9:31 PM] the.mightydill
nice, the only tech thing i have in my room is a pc thats slower than this laptop (because... windows)


[4/10/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
i might install ubuntu on it with dual boot


[4/10/2021 9:32 PM] tux_linux
even ubuntu will be a breeze


[4/10/2021 9:32 PM] tux_linux
it's bloated, but way less than win


[4/10/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
ah it is?


[4/10/2021 9:32 PM] the.mightydill
didnt notice


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
what is the least bloated? arch?


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
well...
when you combine gnome, snaps, thousands of software into one iso


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
it becomes bloated


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
no, LFS


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
ah, true


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
yeahhhh... not doing that again ;p


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
but Arch is good too


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
snaps as in snapd?


[4/10/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/10/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
ah, the only snap i have is spotify


[4/10/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
and about that... is there a reason that media is so slow/laggy on arch? it keeps getting chopped up when i watch a video or listen to music or anything online


[4/10/2021 9:34 PM] tux_linux
are you on firefox?


[4/10/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
chromium


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
but also on discord, watching vids


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] tux_linux
well, hardware


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] tux_linux
but if it is faster on ubuntu


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] tux_linux
i don't know


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
ok


[4/10/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
also, how can i make an archiso?

[4/10/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
I'm due to make one too


[4/10/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
basically, it's a complicated spider web of shared X displays, chroots, cleaning, cleaning and cleaning again


[4/10/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill
oh haha


[4/10/2021 9:38 PM] tux_linux
ok, going to take my bike and go outside take a few pics

[4/11/2021 1:19 AM] the.mightydill
well uhh it's snowing


[4/11/2021 1:19 AM] the.mightydill

but you did the system v edition


[4/11/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
no


[4/11/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
i did the regular one


[4/11/2021 8:14 PM] the.mightydill
this one


[4/11/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
yeah, it is the regular one

[4/11/2021 8:15 PM] the.mightydill
and 2021.3 or something


[4/11/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux

no, for xorg libs


[4/11/2021 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
but yeah, I won't build Qt


[4/11/2021 9:23 PM] the.mightydill
or gtk?

Joined the server.


[4/12/2021 1:31 AM] tux_linux
Hi @tim !


[4/12/2021 1:33 AM] tlsuggs
Hello tux-linux, I joined as I am experimenting with your InkBox images for Kobo Mini 🙂


[4/12/2021 1:33 AM] tlsuggs
I saw the reference to this server in mobileread's server, which I found through KoBox's site


[4/12/2021 1:33 AM] tux_linux
Oh nice!


[4/12/2021 1:33 AM] tux_linux
You're my third tester!


[4/12/2021 1:34 AM] tux_linux
So, did you flash it to a microSD? How do you find it?


[4/12/2021 1:35 AM] tlsuggs
I just wrote 1.0 to a spare 64gb microSD, currently fiddling with the upgrade process to try and get it up to 1.3


[4/12/2021 1:35 AM] tux_linux
Shouldn't be that hard, just extract the archive's content in the .inkbox folder


[4/12/2021 1:36 AM] tlsuggs
I was initially going to use a secondhand older hanvon device and try to write the ancient openinkpot to it but that sort of fizzled out, thankfully this project came on to my radar 🙂


[4/12/2021 1:36 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, OpenInkpot is nice, quite outdated unfortunately


[4/12/2021 1:36 AM] tux_linux
I wanted to have full control over my device, so I decided to make my own OS for it


[4/12/2021 1:37 AM] tux_linux
Well, 64GB won't be of much utility for now, because the onboard storage is limited to 1GB. That's something I have to improve though


[4/12/2021 2:16 AM] tux_linux
Did you get the update installed?


[4/12/2021 2:17 AM] tlsuggs
Yes, was just writing up impressions


[4/12/2021 2:17 AM] tux_linux
Oh ok, nice


[4/12/2021 2:17 AM] tlsuggs
The update process is clean and I have encountered no issues going from 1.0 > 1.3. I was impressed in the initial videos that were posted to /r/linux, but still very cool to see a not-hacked-together user experience for updating.
PDF and picture viewing for non-purely-text works would be nice (and I imagine is already a future goal like larger storage support). Either that or having koreader/other premade viewers as an application one can start within the launcher.
Overall, really impressed and look forward to following however this project goes. I do not write code for a living (limited bash/powershell/etc. to automate tasks I would perform repeatedly), so I do not know whether I will be able to contribute much on that front, but if I can help in testing do let me know.

[4/12/2021 2:18 AM] tlsuggs
I get overly wordy so sometimes it is better for me to post one longer message with less duplicated text lol


[4/12/2021 2:18 AM] tux_linux
Oh it's ok!


[4/12/2021 2:19 AM] tux_linux
The update process was quite... complicated to make, and starting at v1.4 updates will be signed with private keys that will disallow custom updates install unless the kernel is recompiled


[4/12/2021 2:19 AM] tux_linux
But I'm glad that it's working well now


[4/12/2021 2:19 AM] tux_linux
Thanks for the review!


[4/12/2021 2:20 AM] tlsuggs
Can one specify the pubkey it is checking against in case custom builds are required, or some buildtime option?


[4/12/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
It's mounted by an initramfs


[4/12/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
*initrd


[4/12/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
The file is in a squashfs archive, so pretty hard to touch


[4/12/2021 2:21 AM] tux_linux
but yes, it is possible to change it


[4/12/2021 2:21 AM] tlsuggs
still good to prevent users from trying to flash a partial archive and bricking though lol


[4/12/2021 2:22 AM] tux_linux
Yep


[4/12/2021 2:22 AM] tux_linux
Did you try diagnostics mode?


[4/12/2021 2:22 AM] tlsuggs
No, though I do recall something about it from the youtube video I viewed a week or so ago


[4/12/2021 2:23 AM] tux_linux
just reboot, and slide the power button a few times when the green light starts blinking


[4/12/2021 2:24 AM] tux_linux
there you go @dill

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/12/2021 2:31 AM] tlsuggs
I see now what you mean about diagnostics mode, I cannot compare it to earlier revisions (in case something changed in it between 1.0 and 1.3) but it is useful to have a limited recovery environment


[4/12/2021 2:31 AM] tux_linux
Well, yes, you now have a soft-reset option


[4/12/2021 2:32 AM] tux_linux
But over all it's not changed that much


[4/12/2021 2:33 AM] tux_linux
If you want shell access, you can "Reset and allow root access", then enable USBNet


[4/12/2021 2:33 AM] tlsuggs
Ah, understood


[4/12/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill

Reboot ?


[4/12/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill

[4/12/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
like 10 times


[4/12/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
Syu?


[4/12/2021 5:01 AM] the.mightydill
done, that's what caused it


[4/12/2021 5:11 AM] tlsuggs
maybe a libinput update

Well. KoBox runs well on Mini and Touch now


[4/13/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
So I'm gonna ditch the old Qt-based reader framework and integrate an epub reader with chromium in full screen in InkBox that will work like thousands times better


[4/13/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux

It certainly offloads a large amount of work, found an appropriately licensed/resource-light/etc plugin yet?


[4/13/2021 3:58 AM] tux_linux
I'll look into that, but I've seen thousands of them on GitHub

Ok, after seeing the extreme slowness of Chromium when using it side-by-side with Qt, I think I'm going to give a try to NetSurf, it should be able to display that ePUB renderer
For real web browser, I'll include Chromium but Qt will have to be stopped before

I read too many visual stuff like manga to truly appreciate it given the tiny screen, but it is pretty great for purely textual stuff

I don't read many graphic novels/comics but yeah, the contrast is legendary

i don't buy ebooks because i'm a kid, but overdrive is beyond helpful


[4/15/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill
it's why I got a Kobo rather than a Kindle

[4/15/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
of course


[4/15/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
I put a `sudo` in front of `dd` right


[4/15/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/15/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
you pipe the output of xzcat to dd


[4/15/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill
yep, got that


[4/15/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
and it's working


[4/15/2021 4:34 AM] the.mightydill
about to update


[4/15/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
nvm i have to go eat, i've been fasting all day


[4/15/2021 4:36 AM] the.mightydill
bye


[4/15/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
so i went into the diags (great work btw) and went to diagnostics to see kernel version


[4/15/2021 5:05 AM] the.mightydill
it mentioned `nicolas@debian`, is that normal

**resetting with root access**


[4/15/2021 5:27 AM] tux_linux
Yes


[4/15/2021 5:28 AM] tux_linux
It's my 32 bit build QEMU VM


[4/15/2021 5:36 AM] the.mightydill
ah, i see


[4/15/2021 5:40 AM] the.mightydill
overall, i like it! a lot! here are some recommendations/goals:
```
timezone stuff in settings
root access option in OOBE configuration
file formats (though it may be insanely tough)
"the bug" in which the page turning menu disappears
automatic screen size thing idk
KoBox integration (I know you are working on this right now :) )
```

[4/16/2021 5:56 PM] tux_linux
OOBE root access will never make it though. I want InkBox to be as secure as possible, so that's why rooting is only possible with a factory reset.


[4/16/2021 6:09 PM] tux_linux
Well, my VNC trick worked!
And now touch input is perfect for X


[4/16/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
(I couldn't get my old methods working with touch input, so I had to find a new way to do it, and so VNC input via Qt it is!)


[4/16/2021 10:32 PM] tux_linux
When you mount too much filesystems for InkBox ...

1.4 ? Probably not until next week

[4/17/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
I'm migrating everything squashfs to squashfuse because it supports xz compression and I'll be using overlayfs to mount read-only filesystems read-write, so less disk wear and etc.


[4/17/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux

[4/17/2021 1:43 AM] the.mightydill
yeah i will :)


[4/17/2021 1:43 AM] the.mightydill
i meant, what does it do?

you can set the flag in Diags

i.e. what programs use USBNet?

[4/17/2021 1:44 AM] the.mightydill
not even Light Maps?


[4/17/2021 1:44 AM] tux_linux

[4/18/2021 5:46 AM] tux_linux
basically, main rootfs is a squashfs, gets 'merged' with extensions' squashfs (which are kind of an incomplete root filesystem themselves) that are themselves merged to one big folder containing all the incomplete extensions rootfs.
so extensions are merged with rootfs, both read-only at thiis point, and then fuse-overlayfs does the r/w job


[4/18/2021 5:46 AM] tux_linux
complicated, isn't it?


[4/18/2021 5:46 AM] tux_linux
I can get lost very easily ;p


[4/18/2021 5:46 AM] the.mightydill
i can imagine


[4/18/2021 5:46 AM] the.mightydill
oh now i get it lol


[4/18/2021 5:47 AM] tux_linux
thing is... `df -h` will probably have like 30 lines of output haha


[4/18/2021 5:47 AM] tux_linux
even worse, `mount`


[4/18/2021 5:47 AM] the.mightydill
heh yea


[4/18/2021 5:48 AM] tux_linux
now that was the diagram ... I have to actually *do* it now


[4/18/2021 5:48 AM] the.mightydill

OK, made this. Now, let's see if it will work tomorrow...


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] the.mightydill
gl with that :D


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] the.mightydill
what terminal and how did you get transparency btw


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] tux_linux
Guess I'm gonna have nightmare of endless mount tables


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] tux_linux
oh it's QTerminal in my Debian VM


[4/18/2021 6:24 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/18/2021 6:25 AM] tux_linux
it's LXQt, so


[4/18/2021 6:25 AM] tux_linux
I needed a desktop, but lightweight


[4/18/2021 6:25 AM] the.mightydill
ah, like lxde?


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] the.mightydill
just tried qterminal and it looks kind of ugly in plasma


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] tux_linux
No!


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] tux_linux
In Qt!


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] tux_linux
probably that the theme isn't well adapted


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] tux_linux
I guess you could change that easily


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] the.mightydill
except that ofc


[4/18/2021 6:26 AM] tux_linux
you can also install guake, which drops down from the screen when you press F12


[4/18/2021 6:27 AM] tlsuggs
if you are on xfce bind f12 to xfce4-terminal --dropdown or wtv


[4/18/2021 6:27 AM] the.mightydill
doesnt work for me


[4/18/2021 6:28 AM] the.mightydill
on plasma rn, but looking into xfce for linux from scratch


[4/18/2021 6:31 AM] the.mightydill
thx, useful


[4/18/2021 6:32 AM] tux_linux
Did you launch guake first?


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] the.mightydill
`guake`


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] the.mightydill
*presses f12*


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] the.mightydill
wow, cool!


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] tux_linux
haha yep


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] the.mightydill
`System doesn't support transparency`


[4/18/2021 6:33 AM] the.mightydill
oh well


[4/18/2021 6:34 AM] the.mightydill
how do i change the init scripts to launch guake at boot?

I'm finally a lot less busy now, so I'll have time to work on more Kobo stuff


[4/18/2021 7:40 AM] pgaskin
I'll probably start with some NickelMenu stuff


[4/18/2021 7:40 AM] pgaskin
Then, I'll finish the dictutil v3 update


[4/18/2021 7:41 AM] pgaskin
I'll also work on the Kobo emulation when I'm bored


[4/18/2021 3:31 PM] tux_linux
Nice !!!!


[4/18/2021 5:02 PM] the.mightydill
good morning :D


[4/18/2021 5:02 PM] the.mightydill
Great to hear that, pgaskin!


[4/18/2021 7:11 PM] tux_linux
Ok, so my crazy fuse/overlayfs/unionfs thing works


[4/18/2021 7:11 PM] tux_linux
And now I have 48 entries in my mount table lol


[4/18/2021 7:19 PM] the.mightydill
great!


[4/18/2021 7:19 PM] the.mightydill
hahaha


[4/18/2021 7:20 PM] tux_linux
Here's the launch script FWIW

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/startx-F565B


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
rcS or what?


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
no


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
wait no startx


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
it's launched by the initrd which launches the rcS


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
(well the rcS launches startx)


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] tux_linux
no, it is not the same thing at all


[4/18/2021 7:21 PM] the.mightydill
oh


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] tux_linux
So basically, it scans the extensions folder and merges all those mini-root components into the main root, and then it makes it r/w


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
how will you launch xorg from inkbox


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] tux_linux
Some button


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] the.mightydill
applications > chromium?


[4/18/2021 7:22 PM] tux_linux
It will not be "Xorg"


[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
yes something like that

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
The user won't have to realize all the mess that is behind it lol


[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
heh that's smart


[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
tip: if it's rooted, make it "xorg"?


[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
Well, the default wm is i3


[4/18/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
So what could you really do (without a keyboard)


[4/18/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/18/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
I'll make a "Kterm" entry when the device is rooted


[4/18/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
from there, you can launch pretty much everything


[4/18/2021 7:24 PM] the.mightydill
that's better


[4/18/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
Also, if you succeed in getting a shell and the device is not rooted, you can't do much because... X11 is another container/chroot!


[4/18/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
(when you're root though, you can use the SSH extension to ssh to the localhost from the chroot)


[4/18/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill
locking it down a *lot*, i see ;p


[4/18/2021 7:25 PM] the.mightydill
good idea


[4/18/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
Kindles have been my principal inspiration source ;p


[4/18/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
and maybe some Android too


[4/18/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
I already enabled SELinux in the kernel, now in the next releases I'll have to figure out how to make a proper security policy


[4/18/2021 7:26 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux

ahhhh mksquashfs on the kobo is taking ages


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux

[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
understandable ;p


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
amazing that it even runs


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
it would take at least a few hours


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
at *least*


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
not that much


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] the.mightydill
really


[4/18/2021 7:27 PM] tux_linux
It's about 200mb of data


[4/18/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
oh i thought it would be bigger


[4/18/2021 7:28 PM] the.mightydill
wait why don't you mksquashfs on a pc and transfer it to the kobo


[4/18/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
(I just `apk fetch` the packages, then extract them in the proper directory to make a mini root with all the deps that I then merge to the main root)


[4/18/2021 7:28 PM] tux_linux
laziness ;p


[4/18/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
understandable


[4/18/2021 7:29 PM] the.mightydill
i'm very lazy, that's why i'm on discord right now instead of working on blfs which i *really* should get started on again


[4/18/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
It's better than having a homework to do


[4/18/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, i'm in a "academic challenge" program which is more advanced, but we barely have homework


[4/18/2021 7:31 PM] tux_linux

[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] the.mightydill
so it's /chromium/chromium.sqsh?


[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] the.mightydill
or .squashfs


[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
no


[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
it is in /opt/X11/extensions/chromium.isa


[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] tux_linux
(which is exportable userstore, like onboard)


[4/18/2021 7:36 PM] the.mightydill
oh nice


[4/18/2021 7:46 PM] tux_linux
Well... it's been 1 minutes since I typed the command. It's apparently launching, but maybe that XZ compressed squashfs were not a good idea for extensions ...


[4/18/2021 7:46 PM] tux_linux
(because it has to decompress all that on-the fly)


[4/18/2021 7:46 PM] tux_linux
So I'm thinking of switching to gzip for chromium at least


[4/18/2021 7:46 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, that would be slow


[4/18/2021 7:47 PM] tux_linux
ha, it spit out something


[4/18/2021 7:47 PM] the.mightydill
well why even compress it? just do .squashfs


[4/18/2021 7:47 PM] the.mightydill
what does it say?


[4/18/2021 7:47 PM] tux_linux
well, you have to compress it to make a squashfs


[4/18/2021 7:47 PM] the.mightydill
ah...

[4/18/2021 7:48 PM] the.mightydill
`touch /var/run/dbus/system_dbus_socket` or would that break it

[4/18/2021 7:51 PM] the.mightydill
well we'll see


[4/18/2021 7:53 PM] tux_linux
Though it's amazing
I'm running Chromium, which is an xz-compressed squashfs archive, which is mounted in /opt/X11/extensions/chromium, which is merged with the SSH extension, which is merged with the base rootfs in /opt/X11/rootfs/read, which is fuse-overlayfs'd in /xorg, and then chrooted


[4/18/2021 7:54 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[4/18/2021 7:54 PM] tux_linux
Ok, XZ for chromium is definitely too slow, the user will have to wait like 10 mins before it even thinks of printing something on the screen


[4/18/2021 7:54 PM] the.mightydill
gzip or bzip?

[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Because I think gzip won't be enough


[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
oops


[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
accidentally joined voice


[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] the.mightydill
lol


[4/18/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Yes I saw that


[4/18/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
Poor Kobo...


[4/18/2021 8:06 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
Oh, 56% cpu for chromium now


[4/18/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
it's doing something


[4/18/2021 8:13 PM] the.mightydill
great


[4/18/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Imagine wanting to browse the Web and waiting 30 mins for your browser to actually launch


[4/18/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
lol


[4/18/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
maybe integrate a kobo-like browser


[4/18/2021 8:17 PM] the.mightydill
kobo-like as in, like the stock browser


[4/18/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
that is difficult


[4/18/2021 8:17 PM] tux_linux
and impossible, since I can't compile webkit or webengine for a glibc version that old


[4/18/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/18/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill
links?


[4/18/2021 8:18 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux
I'm going to abort the launch of Chromium (wow, it's like I'm saying that it's a space rocket) and gzip the mini root instead


[4/18/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux
we'll see what happens


[4/18/2021 8:24 PM] the.mightydill
it's kind of like a rocket heh... 
> I'm running Chromium, which is an xz-compressed squashfs archive, which is mounted in /opt/X11/extensions/chromium, which is merged with the SSH extension, which is merged with the base rootfs in /opt/X11/rootfs/read, which is fuse-overlayfs'd in /xorg, and then chrooted


[4/18/2021 8:24 PM] tux_linux
hahahaa


[4/18/2021 8:24 PM] the.mightydill
all on a kobo touch with 256mb ram

*touch


[4/18/2021 8:24 PM] tux_linux
but same thing


[4/18/2021 8:25 PM] the.mightydill
plus the fact that this is all on an alpine installation


[4/18/2021 8:25 PM] tux_linux
which is started in a chroot from the initrd!


[4/18/2021 8:25 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 8:26 PM] tux_linux
I'll have to put the diagram in some wiki page or otherwise people (including me) won't understand what's happening

[4/18/2021 8:27 PM] the.mightydill
yeah


[4/18/2021 8:27 PM] tux_linux
I didn't think that it would have worked in the first place


[4/18/2021 8:28 PM] tux_linux

but inkbox wasnt a thing back then...

why FYI? I know that, I made the script

no because you forgot before

wait no


[4/18/2021 11:27 PM] the.mightydill
it registers touch


[4/18/2021 11:28 PM] the.mightydill
but it's inverted


[4/18/2021 11:28 PM] the.mightydill
across the y-axis, even tho theres a fix in the file


[4/18/2021 11:29 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[4/18/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
pretty good but touch is completely messed up


[4/18/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
cpu is at 100 tho lol


[4/18/2021 11:33 PM] the.mightydill
wait at the top it says 100 but in the stats it's 10.4


[4/18/2021 11:33 PM] the.mightydill
it also adds up so the top isnt behaving i guess


[4/18/2021 11:35 PM] the.mightydill
lol i almost installed gnome


[4/18/2021 11:35 PM] the.mightydill

[4/18/2021 11:35 PM] tux_linux

[4/18/2021 11:38 PM] the.mightydill
checking out the thread to see how to rotate

`echo number > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate`

but you'll probably have to start it again
and modify that command in the init script

speed? unexpected to be honest


[4/19/2021 3:08 AM] tux_linux
It's written entirely in C

do you think i should give it a go


[4/20/2021 4:06 AM] tux_linux
I have to package all the software first though


[4/20/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill

[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
ahhhh i see


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
That's why it shows gnome


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
i didn't understand before, but there's VNC? that's cool


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
Yeah a vnc viewer on the Kobo


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
To view your computer's screen


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] the.mightydill
hypothetically it could also work with windows/mac


[4/20/2021 4:07 AM] tux_linux
(and for touch input in KoBox)


[4/20/2021 4:08 AM] tux_linux
As long as it can run a compatible vnc server


[4/20/2021 4:08 AM] the.mightydill
yep, which, chances are, it can


[4/20/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
so does vnc work by adding with `apk`, i could try this with my aura?


[4/20/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
It doesn't work like that


[4/20/2021 4:10 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[4/20/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
You have to have a working Debian 8 chroot

[4/22/2021 12:33 AM] the.mightydill
i


[4/22/2021 12:33 AM] the.mightydill
am


[4/22/2021 12:33 AM] the.mightydill
f*cked


[4/22/2021 12:34 AM] the.mightydill
windows wont boot due to an unmountable boot volume and now parents are gonna be angry


[4/22/2021 2:01 AM] the.mightydill
i am, shall we say, `fsck`ed


[4/22/2021 2:01 AM] the.mightydill
;p


[4/22/2021 2:43 AM] tux_linux
haha good one


[4/22/2021 2:45 AM] the.mightydill
luckily parents arent mad, they just want me to reinstall


[4/22/2021 2:46 AM] the.mightydill
i just discovered ventoy


[4/22/2021 2:46 AM] tux_linux
While you're at it, why not try a dual-boot windows/debian/arch/anything?


[4/22/2021 2:46 AM] tux_linux
(since you're gonna wipe the drive)


[4/22/2021 2:46 AM] the.mightydill
thats what im doing


[4/22/2021 2:46 AM] tux_linux
oh nice


[4/22/2021 2:47 AM] the.mightydill
windows/arch iso dual boot from ventoy, install windows first then arch


[4/22/2021 2:47 AM] the.mightydill
arch first then windows*


[4/22/2021 2:50 AM] tlsuggs
i havent done two on one drive in ages


[4/22/2021 2:50 AM] tlsuggs
wasn't the wisdom usually windows then linux so that grub doesn't mess anything up


[4/22/2021 2:50 AM] tlsuggs
er, so that grub is treated as the preferred bootloader


[4/22/2021 2:50 AM] the.mightydill
i had windows, then installed arch, then bsod


[4/22/2021 2:51 AM] the.mightydill
so im hoping that windows after linux will avoid a bsod


[4/22/2021 2:53 AM] the.mightydill
maybe ubuntu (i'm hoping i can use this for school, and arch seems a little... messy)


[4/22/2021 2:54 AM] the.mightydill
messy for working purposes


[4/22/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
Debian


[4/22/2021 2:55 AM] tux_linux
Ubuntu without the bloat


[4/22/2021 2:55 AM] the.mightydill
ok then


[4/22/2021 3:03 AM] the.mightydill
i did `sudo ventoy -i /dev/sdb` and it made an esp what


[4/22/2021 3:03 AM] the.mightydill
note, i omitted the -g


[4/22/2021 3:36 AM] the.mightydill
booting into windows iso, wish me luck!

The best way IMO is to partition the drive, install Windows, then install Linux, then optionally install rEFInd


[4/22/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
dont have efi


[4/22/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill

[4/24/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
HOLY-


[4/24/2021 4:35 AM] the.mightydill
Ntfs 3g last release was from 2017!?


[4/24/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/24/2021 4:36 AM] tux_linux
Probably because it is considered stable


[4/24/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
Yeah


[4/24/2021 4:43 AM] pgaskin
It will soon be replaced by ntfs3


[4/24/2021 4:43 AM] pgaskin
Which is much faster


[4/24/2021 4:43 AM] pgaskin
It also works properly with Wine


[4/24/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
YES!!!!


[4/24/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill
It worked!


[4/24/2021 5:17 AM] the.mightydill

[4/24/2021 5:29 AM] the.mightydill
Lol


[4/24/2021 8:35 AM] pgaskin
You install everything all at once?


[4/24/2021 8:35 AM] pgaskin
Oh, and you're a KDE person


[4/24/2021 8:36 AM] pgaskin
That would explain most of those packages


[4/24/2021 6:22 PM] the.mightydill
Yep, I did a `pacman -S plasma kde-applications`.


[4/24/2021 6:23 PM] the.mightydill
This time I followed a tutorial because I didn't want to break Windows.


[4/24/2021 6:23 PM] the.mightydill
Normally I just get Plasma though.


[4/24/2021 6:33 PM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux quick question. Why does my cursor default to a Breeze cursor when I hover over my desktop background/wallpaper?


[4/24/2021 6:33 PM] the.mightydill
I have it set to a Windows 10 cursor


[4/24/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
Open source and free software


[4/24/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
Things can't always be perfect


[4/24/2021 6:34 PM] tux_linux
Did you restart KDE?


[4/24/2021 6:35 PM] the.mightydill
Nope...


[4/24/2021 6:35 PM] tux_linux
well, that should help


[4/24/2021 6:35 PM] the.mightydill
Wait, restarting it now


[4/24/2021 6:43 PM] tux_linux
Ok, it's working now

so i have a ventoy usb with a windows ISO. how do I install Windows 10 on a virtual machine?


[4/26/2021 12:22 AM] the.mightydill
with either QEMU, VirtualBox, or Boxes, I don't really care


[4/26/2021 1:01 AM] tux_linux
QEMU


[4/26/2021 1:01 AM] tux_linux
Well, maybe that VirtualBox would be better for windows-specific things


[4/26/2021 1:02 AM] the.mightydill
it's called "oracle vm virtualbox"


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
have you ever used it?


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
yes


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
i have, but my skills with VMs are zero


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
nice!


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
you can try with qemu but I didn't succeed in installing win10


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] tux_linux
win7 works on it though


[4/26/2021 1:03 AM] the.mightydill
some people are recommending KVM


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
`qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom win7.iso -enable-kvm -vga virtio -m 4G -hda win.img`


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
that's qemu


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
really.


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
i had no idea lol


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] tux_linux
they call it qemu/kvm sometimes


[4/26/2021 1:04 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/26/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
you're on the newer PC?


[4/26/2021 1:05 AM] the.mightydill
yep, but cant do it at the moment


[4/26/2021 1:05 AM] tux_linux
ah ok


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
I just spent the past 6 hours trying to write something that would launch ---- netsurf ---- without spitting out random "BadParameter" errors


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
like, it was just a bunch of nonsense


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
`su -c "sh -c 'env DISPLAY=:0 chroot /xorg /bin/netsurf-gtk2'"`


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
y'see


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
i recommend releasing this in separate updates btw


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[4/26/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[4/26/2021 1:48 AM] the.mightydill
dont release kobox/netsurf/etc in one big update otherwise it might break inkbox


[4/26/2021 2:12 AM] tux_linux
It sure won't


[4/26/2021 2:13 AM] tux_linux
It's already complicated to actually make an update package, where I need to test every single new thing that is added, imagine every possible scenario, correct and fix bugs


[4/26/2021 2:13 AM] tux_linux
So no, it will come as a big update


[4/26/2021 2:16 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/26/2021 2:16 AM] the.mightydill
well the update package creation... will be very hard


[4/26/2021 2:16 AM] tux_linux
ofc

so... no `make`?

[4/30/2021 3:23 AM] the.mightydill
it says configure but not compile

Read step 4 again


[4/30/2021 3:24 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[4/30/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
Sometimes the compile step is also in the `install` rule

[4/30/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
But look it up on LQ or something, maybe you'll find some solution


[4/30/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
maybe i'll use a tarball instead of git


[4/30/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
How much time will you survive without it?


[4/30/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
I bet LFSPkgs use Git too

[4/30/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
couldn't you `git clone` before?


[4/30/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
If not, that's the problem for sure


[4/30/2021 3:52 AM] tux_linux
Since you didn't not follow BLFS and the deps


[4/30/2021 3:52 AM] the.mightydill
its not a dep


[4/30/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
then it's strange


[4/30/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
Well, maybe you did install it in LFS


[4/30/2021 3:53 AM] tux_linux
and not in BLFS


[4/30/2021 3:53 AM] the.mightydill
maybe, but i did a google search and it doesnt show up


[4/30/2021 3:54 AM] the.mightydill

how do i transfer it to my laptop :/


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
well


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
ftp?


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
it has to download the ca certs


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
so you'll need internet access


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] the.mightydill
i know


[4/30/2021 3:55 AM] tux_linux
I prefer a simple `python3 -m http.server` in such situations


[4/30/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
thanks, and how do i retrieve the files?


[4/30/2021 3:56 AM] the.mightydill
from lfs chroot/ssh


[4/30/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
if you can access internet

idk where to start with lfspkg... i'm not good at editing bash scripts and i'll probably break it


[4/30/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
make a backup


[4/30/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
then break it


[4/30/2021 11:03 PM] tux_linux
;p


[4/30/2021 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
yea


[4/30/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
General rule with Bash scripts: always check at least 5 times what you've wrote before running it


[4/30/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
`cd $LFS && tar cJf . <what????>`


[4/30/2021 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
yep, and the bad thing is, it's long, and i didn't write it


[4/30/2021 11:04 PM] tux_linux
`tar cJvf ../lfs.tar.xz .`


[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
or the `mksquashfs` way


[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
so then /mnt/lfs.tar.xz


[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
right


[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] tux_linux
well, you could put it elsewhere


[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill

[4/30/2021 11:05 PM] the.mightydill

[4/30/2021 11:06 PM] the.mightydill

[4/30/2021 11:08 PM] the.mightydill
should it do that


[4/30/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
no


[4/30/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
you should umount it before


[4/30/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux
or better, restart the computer

[4/30/2021 11:08 PM] tux_linux

ok


[4/30/2021 11:09 PM] the.mightydill

[4/30/2021 11:57 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/30/2021 11:57 PM] the.mightydill
not yet


[4/30/2021 11:58 PM] tux_linux

It's similar to Linux, but at the same time, very different

It's a nice experience


[4/30/2021 11:58 PM] the.mightydill

[4/30/2021 11:58 PM] the.mightydill
i'll try it


[4/30/2021 11:59 PM] tux_linux

[4/30/2021 11:59 PM] the.mightydill

[5/1/2021 12:00 AM] tux_linux
\*Open\*BSD


[5/1/2021 12:00 AM] tux_linux
and NetBSD is also free


[5/1/2021 12:00 AM] the.mightydill

[5/1/2021 12:01 AM] the.mightydill
oof


[5/1/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
so now its also backing up /sources/linux-5.10.17/* as well...


[5/1/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
ah


[5/1/2021 12:04 AM] tux_linux
that takes a long time


[5/1/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[5/1/2021 12:04 AM] the.mightydill
it's doing drivers right now


[5/1/2021 12:05 AM] the.mightydill
i did that once


[5/1/2021 12:05 AM] tux_linux
That's why I prefer `mksquashfs` to making tar backups


[5/1/2021 12:05 AM] tux_linux
(although you could probably use `pv` to see some progress, never had success with it)


[5/1/2021 12:06 AM] the.mightydill
which one is faster btw


[5/1/2021 12:06 AM] tux_linux
no one


[5/1/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[5/1/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
if you compress with `xz` (which is what `cJf` does) you get maximum compression (and time)
mksquashfs, same


[5/1/2021 12:07 AM] tux_linux
only that you can mount the backups as a disk image without uncompressing them before


[5/1/2021 12:07 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[5/1/2021 12:09 AM] the.mightydill
it *finally* finished compressing the AMD drivers


[5/1/2021 12:14 AM] the.mightydill
so, uh, this is using a lot of cpu haha


[5/1/2021 12:14 AM] the.mightydill
and it finished compressing the drivers...


[5/1/2021 12:14 AM] tux_linux
sure


[5/1/2021 12:14 AM] the.mightydill
as in 97.1


[5/1/2021 12:15 AM] tux_linux

[5/1/2021 12:17 AM] tux_linux
I sometimes have a QEMU KVM Debian VM with 4 cores enabled running, along with a Google Meet online class, a GCC workload running in the background and some 10+ tabs open in the web browser regarding various Qt/C++ issues


[5/1/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill
ah well it crashed


[5/1/2021 12:20 AM] the.mightydill

[5/1/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill

How To Use SSHFS to Mount Remote File Systems Over SSH | DigitalOcean
Luckily there is a way to mount your VPS file system to your local computer so you can make changes on the fly and treat your droplet as local storage.

[5/1/2021 3:33 AM] tux_linux
that should get you going


[5/1/2021 3:33 AM] the.mightydill
why not `dd` tho?


[5/1/2021 3:33 AM] the.mightydill
okay


[5/1/2021 3:33 AM] tux_linux
then you just run `mksquashfs` from the powerful laptop


[5/1/2021 3:34 AM] the.mightydill
pc but yea


[5/1/2021 3:34 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah sure


[5/1/2021 3:34 AM] tux_linux
takes an incredibly large amount of space without us needing that


[5/1/2021 3:35 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[5/1/2021 3:35 AM] the.mightydill
sshfs, mount it, cp it over to my pc's local storage, then squashfs?


[5/1/2021 3:35 AM] tux_linux
no


[5/1/2021 3:35 AM] tux_linux
squashfs from the sshfs tree


[5/1/2021 3:36 AM] tux_linux
that's network magic \*sprinkle magical fairy lights everywhere\*


[5/1/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
So it's like if the host PC's folder was becoming a drive/block device on the client PC


[5/1/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[5/1/2021 3:37 AM] the.mightydill
host, as in laptop?


[5/1/2021 3:37 AM] tux_linux
yes


[5/1/2021 3:38 AM] the.mightydill
so host is the one with lfs.


[5/1/2021 3:38 AM] tux_linux
yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[5/1/2021 3:40 AM] the.mightydill
what is a droplet


[5/1/2021 3:40 AM] tux_linux
probably digitalocean's VPS server or something


[5/1/2021 3:40 AM] tux_linux
you should replace it with "host", probably


[5/1/2021 3:41 AM] the.mightydill
it's a cloud computing thing


[5/1/2021 3:41 AM] tux_linux
yes


[5/1/2021 3:42 AM] the.mightydill
let me grab my mouse
(i only have the one mouse for 2 computers so i normally use the PC with the mouse ;p)


[5/1/2021 3:45 AM] the.mightydill
> ```sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/ /mnt/droplet```


[5/1/2021 3:45 AM] the.mightydill
what is xxx? is it the PC or laptop? :/


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
PC


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
wait, where do i run the command from.....


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
laptop


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
but, /mnt/lfs doesnt exist on pc


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
mkdir first?


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
well; create it


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] the.mightydill
yea


[5/1/2021 3:46 AM] tux_linux
or you can mount it elsewhere too


[5/1/2021 3:47 AM] the.mightydill
but then that mounts my entire laptop on the pc, right? :thonk: without the emoji


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
No


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
just the folder


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
I assume you run sshfs from /mnt/lfs on the laptop


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] the.mightydill
ohh ok


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
since that seems to be what it needs


[5/1/2021 3:48 AM] tux_linux
but maybe


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
> Now we can use sshfs to mount the file system locally with the following command.


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
`file system`


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
not `folder`


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
we'll see


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
ok


[5/1/2021 3:49 AM] the.mightydill
let me just start an ssh server


[5/1/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
dows it have to be *root*@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/


[5/1/2021 3:57 AM] the.mightydill
or can it also be dill


[5/1/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
dill


[5/1/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
if you have write access to /mnt/lfs


[5/1/2021 3:57 AM] tux_linux
`chown -R dill /mnt/lfs`

[5/1/2021 3:59 AM] the.mightydill

[5/1/2021 4:00 AM] the.mightydill
do i run sshfs from laptop or pc


[5/1/2021 4:00 AM] tux_linux
laptop


[5/1/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
it doesnt work


[5/1/2021 4:01 AM] the.mightydill
are you sure


[5/1/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux

[5/1/2021 4:01 AM] tux_linux
I haven't ever had luck with NFS or SSHfs

[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
NO it's supposed to be ran on pc

oh yeah


[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
oops again


[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/mnt/lfs */mnt/lfs* is the mountpoint, which means it has to be on pc


[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] the.mightydill
no lol its fine


[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
I guess it could be either way too


[5/1/2021 4:05 AM] tux_linux
like you put root@... after /mnt/lfs


[5/1/2021 4:06 AM] the.mightydill

no, because you just `cp`

How can I use tar command to group files without compression?
I have a very large folder of 120,000+ files. and I need to move them to another location on my same machine (same partition).

I'd like to use the tar command to group them up as a single unit and...

it's possible to boot a different kernel when you press the home button on the kobo touch n905c


[5/2/2021 11:20 PM] the.mightydill
I could just cp vmlinuz over to USB drive

it would be surprising if those were real commands


[5/3/2021 2:25 AM] the.mightydill
the thing is, there are a bunch of things in /usr/* that are made with the temporary toolchain


[5/3/2021 2:26 AM] tux_linux
you might have to start it over

Cannot recommend using kali as your main OS, many tools/configuration changes made to that OS are so that it can be used as an appliance


[5/3/2021 4:00 AM] tlsuggs
not as a reasonably secure desktop OS

GNU/Linux naming controversy
Within the free software and the open-source software communities there is controversy over whether to refer to computer operating systems that use a combination of GNU software and Linux kernel as "GNU/Linux" or "Linux" systems.Proponents of the term Linux argue that it is far more commonly used by the public and media and that it serves as a g...

[5/4/2021 4:13 PM] pgaskin
They cut the coax cable because they couldn't figure out how to unscrew the connector


[5/4/2021 4:13 PM] pgaskin
And then tied it in a tight knot, damaging the cable


[5/4/2021 4:14 PM] pgaskin
The cable is just a long wire going up from the drop in the basement to the third floor, sticking out beside another outlet

so config-n705 and config-n705-diags for the mini

only config-n705 at the moment

did you try usbnet yet?


[5/4/2021 8:56 PM] the.mightydill
no


[5/4/2021 8:56 PM] the.mightydill
from... diags, right


[5/4/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
you enable it in diags


[5/4/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
in "flags"


[5/4/2021 8:57 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[5/4/2021 8:57 PM] tux_linux
but there's also an "emergency recovery shell" option in the "Diagnostics" tab which starts a telnet server on 192.168.2.2


[5/4/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill
telnet or ssh?


[5/4/2021 8:58 PM] tux_linux
ssh on main system


[5/4/2021 8:58 PM] tux_linux
telnet in diags


[5/4/2021 8:58 PM] the.mightydill

i would but my parents are busy and my wallet isnt in my room


[5/4/2021 9:18 PM] tux_linux
ah


[5/4/2021 9:19 PM] tux_linux
Well if it's not a credit card, I usually slaughter my school ID card or bus pass ;p


[5/4/2021 9:19 PM] the.mightydill

[5/4/2021 9:33 PM] the.mightydill
flashing light


[5/4/2021 9:33 PM] tux_linux
if you try to slide the power button a couple times to boot in diags, does it work?


[5/4/2021 9:34 PM] the.mightydill
let me see


[5/4/2021 9:34 PM] tux_linux
if it got to a flashing light, then it booted the kernel


[5/4/2021 9:34 PM] tux_linux
so at least that part is good


[5/4/2021 9:35 PM] the.mightydill
no diags


[5/4/2021 9:36 PM] tux_linux
then ... I guess the only way to know what's wrong is serial
do you have your old Mini?


[5/4/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill
ye


[5/4/2021 9:36 PM] the.mightydill

[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
how is input achieved? is it touch?


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
No, as I said, serial, especially for security reasons


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
but... this is the diags partition?


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
wait no it isnt


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
(you don't want an user with a locked down device to be able to access a shell)


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
ah true


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] tux_linux
It's another kernel


[5/5/2021 3:22 AM] the.mightydill
ohhhh ok


[5/5/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
It boots when you press the Home button on the Touch


[5/5/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
and could probably be adapted via a software option for the Mini


[5/5/2021 3:23 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[5/5/2021 3:23 AM] tux_linux
Its main purpose is to provide you a recovery environment when you've screwed everything else up


[5/5/2021 3:23 AM] the.mightydill
ah ok


[5/5/2021 3:24 AM] the.mightydill

no


[5/5/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
initrd


[5/5/2021 3:24 AM] the.mightydill
oh ok


[5/5/2021 3:24 AM] tux_linux
Well, they're pretty much the same, but there are a few differences


[5/5/2021 3:25 AM] tux_linux
It allows you to download a kernel with the xmodem protocol via serial
i.e. transfer a file on a serial connection
takes about 8 minutes for ... 4MiB

{Reactions}
👍 

[5/5/2021 3:25 AM] tux_linux
but... it's an emergency environment ... so...


[5/5/2021 3:26 AM] tux_linux
I also put some diagnostics/tests if ever InkBox gets sold in new ereaders (my dream)
e.g., graphics gray scale test, sleep mode test


[5/5/2021 3:27 AM] the.mightydill
heh, yeah, that would be awesome


[5/5/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux
first e-reader company to have the software entirely open source


[5/5/2021 3:27 AM] tux_linux

yeah


[5/5/2021 3:31 AM] the.mightydill

I once got back to Arch two weeks ago (liveusb) and ran my Ubuntu install in a QEMU virtual machine (hardware passthrough) I did not like the fact that my entire debian 32-bit vm was wiped off the disk when I rebooted into plain ubuntu

I had to reinstall everything, I almost lost all of my kernel customizations, initrd, long rcS scripts, configs, etc. Fortunately I still had my two Kobos running the last compiled kernel, so I extracted everything from them

how do i install a deb package with `dpkg`?


[5/5/2021 8:34 PM] the.mightydill
```dpkg installs Debian package manager.
    This is useful for those who want to create/modify DEB files.
    However, *do not* use dpkg to install Debian packages in your ArchLinux machine.
    This will break your system!
    You will need to go back to Arch wiki and read the installation guide again.
    You've been warned!

I usually get stopped up around the point where you get an actual binary or shellcode, but checking what the hash is in VT usually answers that question quickly

yeah, it does seem fun


[5/8/2021 11:26 PM] pgaskin
That's essentially what we do to make the patches. It seems daunting at first, but it's really not that bad once you get started.

resetting inkbox because usbnet wasn't working :/


[5/10/2021 6:25 PM] tux_linux
What wasn't working?
More likely your computer was the issue


[5/10/2021 6:25 PM] the.mightydill
maybe.


[5/10/2021 6:25 PM] the.mightydill
it still isn't working


[5/10/2021 6:26 PM] the.mightydill
wasn't working - kobo was not recognized by computer


[5/10/2021 6:42 PM] the.mightydill
still not working on a different port, however the kobo powers on when plugged in and shows that it is charging...


[5/10/2021 11:29 PM] tux_linux
Maybe that the precise USBNET_ENABLE flag is now throwing a random "I/O error"
That happens sometimes with ext2fs
Should not happen that often anymore in ext4


[5/10/2021 11:30 PM] the.mightydill
did not work even after reboot, reset, and sleep + wake.


[5/10/2021 11:31 PM] tux_linux
yeah, I/O errors stay there once they've appeared.
you could try going in diags to see if the USBNet checkbox is checked or not
If not, then it's very likely an I/O error. Recheck it and if it still isn't checked after a reboot, well


[5/10/2021 11:31 PM] tux_linux
`fsck -vcck /dev/mmcblk0p1`


[5/10/2021 11:32 PM] the.mightydill
it is.


[5/10/2021 11:34 PM] tux_linux
can you access the "emergency recovery shell"?


[5/10/2021 11:34 PM] the.mightydill
let me grab it


[5/10/2021 11:34 PM] the.mightydill
but first i need to open up linux (not on my computer right now)


[5/10/2021 11:35 PM] tux_linux
ok


[5/10/2021 11:44 PM] the.mightydill
booting into diags


[5/10/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
```[root@kobo ]# fsck -vcck /dev/mmcblk0p1
fsck (busybox 1.24.1, 2021-03-07 23:08:10 UTC)
fsck: fsck.auto: No such file or directory
[root@kobo ]# ```


[5/10/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
no, if it's checked it's OK


[5/10/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
no need to `fsck`


[5/10/2021 11:47 PM] the.mightydill
but it doesnt work in main


[5/10/2021 11:47 PM] tux_linux
also, why is the prompt `[root@kobo ]#` there?


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
exported PS1


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
it should only be `#`


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
ah


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
because # felt weird


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
means root


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] the.mightydill
yeah, that's why there's # in the other one


[5/10/2021 11:48 PM] tux_linux
can you `mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt`


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
let me boot in main first


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
and `cat /mnt/var/log/rc.log`


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
no


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
why?


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
mount mmcblk0p3 from diags


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] the.mightydill
no, i mean, see if usbnet works in main


[5/10/2021 11:49 PM] tux_linux
well it didn't work before so it shouldn't now... ?


[5/10/2021 11:50 PM] the.mightydill
ye but still


[5/10/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux
you can try anyway


[5/10/2021 11:50 PM] the.mightydill
ok diags time


[5/10/2021 11:50 PM] tux_linux

User agent
In computing, a user agent is any software, acting on behalf of a user, which "retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with Web content." A user agent is therefore a special kind of software agent. 
Some prominent examples of user agents are web browsers and email readers. Often, a user agent acts as the client in a client–server...

I'm BlauMond from mobileread, I want to port PostmarketOS (alpine-based mobile linux distro) to my Glo HD so I joined here to get some inspiration 🙂


[5/20/2021 10:20 AM] blaumond5820
@tux-linux You mentioned that you got an Alpine build running on your Glo HD, may I ask how you did it? For now I am curious about the flashing and booting. Did you use your own uBoot or did you just flash your alpine image to the right place?


[5/20/2021 1:02 PM] nalcod
Joined the server.


[5/20/2021 1:15 PM] tux_linux
I started off an Alpine minirootfs and added all the remaining packages that were found in e.g. the raspberry Pi image of it via a chroot with qemu-arm.
I just put the image in mmcblk0p1 after, no need to modify u-boot or the kernel, though I did both for InkBox. It's enough to get you started without any recompiling.
I disabled the limited access of the file, you can now download it, sorry...


[5/20/2021 1:15 PM] tux_linux
Btw, hi!!


[5/20/2021 1:15 PM] tux_linux
And hi @Nalco too!


[5/20/2021 1:18 PM] blaumond5820
Hi, thanks @tux-linux !
Can you explain the part about adding all the remaining packages that were found in the raspberry pi image?


[5/20/2021 1:18 PM] blaumond5820
Was this necessary to get it running, or did you just do it to have more utilities that arent in the minirootfs by default?


[5/20/2021 1:23 PM] tux_linux
There's a bunch of apk files in the rpi image, and you can just `apk add` them from the chroot
I.e. look at the file names and the package name should come naturally. In doubt, look up `alpine Linux <pkg name>`


[5/20/2021 1:24 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, I needed to add openrc for example (all package names found in the rpi image)


[5/20/2021 2:36 PM] blaumond5820

@tux-linux thanks!
Do I understand correctly:
- you don't touch the u-Boot
- you flash your custom kernel to mmcblk0 with seek=2048
- you add some drivers
- you flash your alpine squashfs to mmcblk0p1?

(and is this the correct order or do I need to flash the alpine squashfs earlier?)


[5/21/2021 2:00 PM] tux_linux
Yes to all and the last one doesn't matter


[5/21/2021 2:01 PM] tux_linux
And bs=512 seek=2048 for dd

Hey @tux-linux , is it necessary to use dd from inside the Glo HD, or can I just DD things onto the SD card from my laptop?


[5/22/2021 2:58 PM] blaumond5820
And did I understand correctly that the squashfs image should be flashed as is? Or should I unsquash it first? 🤔


[5/22/2021 3:58 PM] tux_linux
Unsquash it first!
But you just have me a wild idea for InkBox's recoveryfs...


[5/22/2021 3:59 PM] tux_linux
Either one will do


[5/22/2021 3:59 PM] blaumond5820
Thanks, so that's why it didn't work 😅


[5/22/2021 4:00 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, although a thing like that would be awesome


[5/22/2021 4:01 PM] tux_linux
Like, it could mount it at boot and with overlays, you'd still get r/w access but you would save space


[5/22/2021 4:02 PM] blaumond5820
Hmm, how do I best unsquash it into something DDable?


[5/22/2021 4:02 PM] blaumond5820
DD doesn't like directories


[5/22/2021 4:03 PM] tux_linux
Well, format mmcblk0p1 as ext4 and extract it in there


[5/22/2021 4:04 PM] tux_linux
Think of it as a rootfs tar archive.
The best thing with squashfs is that you can mount the archive without extracting it.
But in that case, you have to extract it


[5/22/2021 4:06 PM] blaumond5820
Can't believe I didn't think of that 😁

You're lucky because the Glo HD's kernel (3.0.35) is still supported by the latest Alpine version. You couldn't install Debian 10 on it (IIRC, even 9 wouldn't work) because the glibc version won't support that kernel.
`FATAL: Kernel too old!`
Yeah. And that's everytime it runs a binary.


[5/22/2021 4:20 PM] blaumond5820
Not lucky, smart! I chose the GloHD because of its kernel version! 😄


[5/22/2021 4:21 PM] tux_linux
Nice, though I'm don't look forward to the days when that kernel too will be completely unsupported...


[5/22/2021 4:26 PM] blaumond5820
Hopefully we'll manage mainline before that happens 😉


[5/22/2021 4:28 PM] blaumond5820
or at least mainline + some drivers


[5/22/2021 4:28 PM] blaumond5820
PmOS does this with a device-specific package for each device


[5/22/2021 4:32 PM] blaumond5820
I am running into an error when attempting to start, any clue what I might have missed? Perhaps you ran into it too:

Another quick question regarding the drivers:
I have both a "freescale" and "mx6sl-ntx" folder that have some driver files in them. Some of these exist in both folders. Which should I prioritize?

[5/23/2021 10:17 AM] blaumond5820
I wanted to start out with the original kernel for PmOS porting since I don't know all  the modifications you made and PmOS keeps the patches separate from the original source


[5/23/2021 10:27 AM] blaumond5820
/arch/arm/configs/imx6s_ntx_alyssum_defconfig

Is this the kernel config file that you used too?


[5/23/2021 10:28 AM] tux_linux
I used the default .config that was in the kernel source tarball.
In doubt, on the Kobo:
`zcat /proc/config.gz`


[5/23/2021 10:31 AM] blaumond5820
Oh damn, I had missed the ".config" file 😅


[5/23/2021 10:32 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, but using the zcat thing assures you that you have a bootable config


[5/23/2021 10:32 AM] tux_linux
And the mx6 alyssum defconfig should do too, haven't tested it

[5/23/2021 10:38 AM] tux_linux

[5/23/2021 10:38 AM] blaumond5820

How has the Glo HD been working for you? You probably haven't messed with it as much yet?


[5/23/2021 10:40 AM] tux_linux
Well, it's better than the imx507s for a lot of things
And while I haven't tested the kernel modules extensively, I didn't experience anything strange yet


[5/23/2021 10:41 AM] tux_linux
The main reason I didn't start InkBox on the Glo HD is because the screen was completely broken


[5/23/2021 10:41 AM] blaumond5820
I'm glad I went with the Glo HD for my first try 😅


[5/23/2021 10:42 AM] tux_linux
Since then, the main board is hanging around next to the router, serving mediawiki with MariaDB

No, just had a random idea

It goes to some sort of sleep after a few seconds without touch input it seems, is this also the case for your inkbox?

[5/23/2021 10:47 AM] blaumond5820
It sounds sensible to preserve battery power


[5/23/2021 10:47 AM] tux_linux
With `watchdog /dev/watchdog` or something like that


[5/23/2021 10:47 AM] blaumond5820
I'll have to read about it more


[5/23/2021 10:48 AM] tux_linux
But


[5/23/2021 10:48 AM] tux_linux
Try `i2c probe` at u-boot console, then boot


[5/23/2021 10:48 AM] tux_linux
That works for me in the mini and touch


[5/23/2021 10:49 AM] tux_linux
Because it's handled by a microcontroller


[5/23/2021 10:49 AM] blaumond5820
Oh on the topic of uboot, how do I get the uboot console? I remember from an sbc that I just needed to press a button to interrupt the regular booting, but that doesnt seem to be the case here


[5/23/2021 10:49 AM] tux_linux
Oops


[5/23/2021 10:50 AM] tux_linux
Did you update to latest firmware before installing Alpine?


[5/23/2021 10:50 AM] blaumond5820
I did that a few months back, but not recently


[5/23/2021 10:50 AM] tux_linux
Because that also installs an U-Boot build without bootdelay=0, but set to 1 instead


[5/23/2021 10:51 AM] blaumond5820
Oh interesting


[5/23/2021 10:51 AM] tux_linux
On mine though I could access U-Boot right away


[5/23/2021 10:51 AM] blaumond5820
I will give it a shot


[5/23/2021 10:52 AM] blaumond5820
Made a backup of the original SD card thankfully 🙂


[5/23/2021 10:53 AM] tux_linux
On imx507 which were deeply locked down I had to recompile U-Boot and change the environment offset from 768 to 766, then change the envvar while it said "Environment broken - Bad CRC or MMC" then saveenv, writeenv and recompile with offset 768


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] tux_linux
That offset variable is somewhere in include/configs in the U-Boot tarball


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] blaumond5820
Did you use a new version of uboot?


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] tux_linux
Well, technically not variable, it's a #define statement


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] tux_linux
No


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] blaumond5820
The one I found on the glohd was quite old, some 2009 version


[5/23/2021 10:54 AM] tux_linux
They're all like that


[5/23/2021 10:55 AM] tux_linux
Heavily patched U-Boot source


[5/23/2021 10:55 AM] tux_linux
So they don't want to move to a new version because they have all they want


[5/23/2021 10:55 AM] blaumond5820
I see, I feared that^^


[5/23/2021 10:56 AM] tux_linux
Bootloader's job is to load kernel into RAM then boot it, so anything else is extra ;p


[5/23/2021 10:58 AM] tux_linux
I even bet the Kindle PW4 is still using that 2009.08 tree


[5/23/2021 10:59 AM] blaumond5820
Well it does its job, so I suppose it's okay for now^^


[5/23/2021 10:59 AM] tux_linux
Yep

Brain flash for the watchdog problem; since the screen is IR, you could put anything on it and it should register as if you were tapping it with your finger


[5/23/2021 11:09 AM] blaumond5820
Yes, I think that giving a second life to the innumerable old devices is a great thing, and it should be documented, preserved and maintained

[5/23/2021 11:10 AM] blaumond5820
That was also the motivation behind postmarketOS I think


[5/23/2021 11:10 AM] tux_linux
Yeah maybe

[5/23/2021 3:35 PM] blaumond5820
Hey, sorry but I need more help 😅 
Now I am getting an error while trying to compile. The makefile complains that the source tree is not clean (because of the .config file).
What was your procedure in compiling the source by kobo for the glo hd?


[5/23/2021 3:37 PM] tux_linux
Huh?


[5/23/2021 3:37 PM] tux_linux
What toolchain are you using?


[5/23/2021 3:37 PM] tux_linux
You can always do `make mrproper` but this shouldn't happen


[5/23/2021 3:41 PM] blaumond5820
pmOS has its own tool called "pmbootstrap" which uses GCC


[5/23/2021 3:41 PM] blaumond5820
It does everything in an Alpine chroot internally


[5/23/2021 3:41 PM] tux_linux
Wait, but what source tree are you using?


[5/23/2021 3:42 PM] blaumond5820
The one from kobo's github


[5/23/2021 3:42 PM] tux_linux
And you passed that to pmbootstrap ?


[5/23/2021 3:42 PM] blaumond5820
Yes, it is downloaded and extracted directly by pmbootstrap, so it is unchanged by default


[5/23/2021 3:43 PM] tux_linux
You're gonna have problems


[5/23/2021 3:43 PM] tux_linux
I'd compile the kernel separately with a proper toolchain (or nickel TC) at least


[5/23/2021 3:44 PM] blaumond5820
What do you mean by "proper toolchain"?


[5/23/2021 3:44 PM] tux_linux
Well, something that will lead to a bootable kernel


[5/23/2021 3:44 PM] tux_linux
Kobo HW is so finicky that just a tiny change in the compilation can mess everything up


[5/23/2021 3:45 PM] blaumond5820
What did you use to compile the kernel?


[5/23/2021 3:45 PM] tux_linux
NickelTC


[5/23/2021 3:45 PM] tux_linux
koxtoolchain should work too


[5/23/2021 3:46 PM] tux_linux
But to give you an idea, successfully compiled kernels with NickelTC won't boot on imx507, and when compiled with the old 2013 provided toolchain, it works


[5/23/2021 3:49 PM] blaumond5820
Hmm, I am not sure if/how other toolchains will work with pmbootstrap/pmOS


[5/23/2021 3:50 PM] tux_linux
Userspace is less finicky though


[5/23/2021 3:50 PM] tux_linux
Though when the libc doesn't want to work, it won't work


[5/23/2021 3:50 PM] blaumond5820
But this error I got has nothing to do with this yet, so I think I want to try how far I can get with the pmbootstrap tools for now


[5/23/2021 3:51 PM] tux_linux
Did you try make mrproper ?


[5/23/2021 3:51 PM] blaumond5820
I'll try to add it to the APKBUILD


[5/23/2021 3:51 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, or maybe just unpack the tarball and do it there, then repack it


[5/23/2021 5:48 PM] blaumond5820
Woah it compiled! And I only had to patch two files in a minor way! Now let's see if anything boots 😅 
(or perhaps there are more steps in between, don't know pmOS that well yet )


[5/23/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
Don't get high hopes, that's all I can say


[5/23/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
Surely something is *bound* to fail, it can't be that perfect ;p


[5/23/2021 6:48 PM] blaumond5820
```

[5/23/2021 7:24 PM] tux_linux
Did you flash an uImage ?


[5/23/2021 7:24 PM] blaumond5820
I already figured out I need a legacy uboot image, there is luckily a way to generate it from pmbootstrap 🙂

{Reactions}
👍 

[5/23/2021 7:24 PM] blaumond5820
That's the next thing i'll try


[5/23/2021 7:25 PM] blaumond5820
It would be cool if I get this working, I have confidence in pmOS tooling since many heavily locked down and modified devices have successfully booted it in some manner


[5/23/2021 7:25 PM] blaumond5820
Many have even gotten mainline support over time


[5/23/2021 7:26 PM] blaumond5820
it'd be great to add an ereader to that collection of devices


[5/23/2021 7:26 PM] tux_linux
That's an impossible dream for me in Kobos


[5/23/2021 7:26 PM] blaumond5820
I am not dreaming that far just yet either^^


[5/23/2021 7:27 PM] blaumond5820
Even downstream kernel support would be great


[5/23/2021 7:29 PM] tux_linux
Yeah
At least with recent kernels they introduced dtbs and such, sadly it was not like that when those old kernels were designed though


[5/23/2021 7:40 PM] blaumond5820
It appears someone is insane enough to try, I saw someone working on a DTB for the Glo HD 😁


[5/23/2021 7:41 PM] tux_linux

[5/24/2021 7:09 PM] tux_linux
ugh


[5/24/2021 7:09 PM] the.mightydill
like, what? hexchat was free on linux


[5/24/2021 7:10 PM] tux_linux
no


[5/24/2021 7:10 PM] the.mightydill
i'll be on linux in quite a while, sorry. i'm downloading some other irc thing and will see if that works


[5/24/2021 7:10 PM] tux_linux
try "windows 7 64-bit installer" instead


[5/24/2021 7:10 PM] the.mightydill
ah well i seem to be quite stupid


[5/24/2021 7:11 PM] tux_linux
but idk why it's 12.79 in ms store


[5/24/2021 7:11 PM] tux_linux

yep


[5/24/2021 7:11 PM] tux_linux

[5/24/2021 7:11 PM] blaumond5820
free software != gratis builds 😉


[5/24/2021 7:12 PM] the.mightydill
scam


[5/24/2021 7:12 PM] the.mightydill
pressed connect and nothing happened and i did it like 10 times...


[5/24/2021 7:12 PM] tux_linux
maybe try only connecting to irc.libera.chat, no channel


[5/24/2021 7:12 PM] tux_linux
then /JOIN in the prompt


[5/24/2021 7:14 PM] the.mightydill
nope


[5/24/2021 7:14 PM] tux_linux
try KiwiIRC


[5/24/2021 7:15 PM] tux_linux
that works, just tested it


[5/24/2021 7:17 PM] the.mightydill
let me beg my mom to open my wifi because i cant be on anymore


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] tux_linux
can't you ssh to the raspberry pi?


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] the.mightydill
hopefully be back at ~2:15?


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, no problem


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] the.mightydill
nope, because... well. lineage


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] the.mightydill
os


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] tux_linux
install termux on lineage


[5/24/2021 7:18 PM] tux_linux
and irssi there


[5/24/2021 9:50 PM] tux_linux
Why not do some compiling on this thing?

[5/24/2021 10:39 PM] tux_linux
Ok, I'll hop in in the channel shortly


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] the.mightydill
doing a quick Syu and then installing kiwiirc


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] the.mightydill
oof a linux update


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] tux_linux
No kiwiirc is online


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] tux_linux
In your web browser


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] the.mightydill
ohhh ok


[5/24/2021 10:40 PM] tux_linux
But since you're on Linux you can try irssi


[5/24/2021 10:41 PM] the.mightydill
irssi running


[5/24/2021 10:41 PM] tux_linux
Ok, I'll be there soon

[5/29/2021 8:35 PM] the.mightydill
Nice!


[5/29/2021 8:36 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, I needed to do it, was starting to forget all of that haha


[5/29/2021 8:36 PM] the.mightydill
Yeah, it's a complicated thing without documentation


[5/29/2021 8:37 PM] tux_linux
I still need to do:
- Filesystem organization
- Mount tree, explanation of why it's so complicated
- X11 misc
- Dev keys
- Spinning your own InkBox
etc.........


[5/29/2021 8:38 PM] the.mightydill
Yikes...


[5/29/2021 8:38 PM] tux_linux
but filesystems and mounts will be fun I guess


[5/29/2021 8:38 PM] tux_linux
I'm at 104 lines for `mount`

[5/29/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
on the internet it said something about... linux-doctools? not on lfs website tho so idk the dependencies or how to make it


[5/29/2021 9:14 PM] tux_linux
did you install docbook-xsl?


[5/29/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
i think so


[5/29/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
yes


[5/29/2021 9:15 PM] the.mightydill
i did it yesterday


[5/29/2021 9:16 PM] tux_linux
can you `wget` that from lfs chroot?

[5/30/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[5/30/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
i majorly f*cked up


[5/30/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
deleted /lib


[5/30/2021 12:52 AM] the.mightydill
that can be fixed tho right


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] the.mightydill
@tux-linux help 😭 im scared


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] tux_linux
Difficultly


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] tux_linux
If you have a backup


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] the.mightydill
just recompile all the libs...?


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] the.mightydill
remember, i reinstalled arch, and forgot to backup... 🤦


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] tux_linux
Yes, but without libs to recompile libs, how do you do?


[5/30/2021 12:53 AM] the.mightydill
chroot


[5/30/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
right


[5/30/2021 12:54 AM] tux_linux
How will you chroot without the lib for bash?


[5/30/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
🤦


[5/30/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
ahhhhh


[5/30/2021 12:54 AM] the.mightydill
wait maybe... compile for arch and cp to lfs


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
Nooo


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
or partial lfs reinstall


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
That will probably cause libc issues


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] tux_linux
You never backupped LFS?


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
i did but then reinstalled arch 🤦


[5/30/2021 12:55 AM] the.mightydill
without backup 🤦


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
And you erased the backup


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
yes


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
why


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] tux_linux
.


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
oh


[5/30/2021 12:56 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[5/30/2021 12:57 AM] the.mightydill

[5/30/2021 1:17 AM] tux_linux
but if you deleted everything in /lib you're not that much more lucky either


[5/30/2021 1:17 AM] tux_linux
is there a lot in /usr/lib ?

[5/30/2021 1:20 AM] tux_linux
`libBrokenLocale.so ` this one always make me laugh
but most of the optional software specific libs seem to be there, so maybe recompiling LFS and putting the new lib contents in /lib should do the trick


[5/30/2021 1:20 AM] tux_linux
or at least, give you a minimal set of tools to work with


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
haha. but... recompiling lfs?


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
😓


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
well, you don't have any backup...


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
or just libs, with temp toolchain


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill
my fault


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] tux_linux
that might lead to an even more broken system


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill

uh


[5/30/2021 1:21 AM] the.mightydill

[5/30/2021 2:01 AM] the.mightydill
backup broken lfs


[5/30/2021 2:01 AM] the.mightydill
make new lfs (scary)


[5/30/2021 2:02 AM] the.mightydill
(stupid time!) cp broken lfs to new lfs so all my blfs stuff is back and /lib remains intact


[5/30/2021 2:02 AM] the.mightydill
(overwrite)


[5/30/2021 2:05 AM] tux_linux

[5/30/2021 2:07 AM] the.mightydill
does that mean it *is* a bad idea?


[5/30/2021 2:07 AM] tux_linux
yes, but you can try


[5/30/2021 2:07 AM] tux_linux
make a backup of the existing LFS before though


[5/30/2021 2:10 AM] the.mightydill
> backup broken lfs
unless you mean the new one?


[5/30/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
yes. broken one


[5/30/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
well, both


[5/30/2021 2:11 AM] the.mightydill
partial?


[5/30/2021 2:11 AM] the.mightydill
this time i'm storing the backup online


[5/30/2021 2:11 AM] tux_linux
try it


[5/30/2021 2:45 AM] the.mightydill

[5/30/2021 4:41 AM] tux_linux

[5/30/2021 4:45 AM] tux_linux
You start to understand what it could have become if you transplanted the /lib from your current system to lfs ;p


[5/30/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
i deperately want to know what libraries *exactly* were in /lib


[5/30/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
yep...


[5/30/2021 4:46 AM] tux_linux
you can do `ldd` on some executables to see


[5/30/2021 4:47 AM] the.mightydill
glibc was a big one

[5/30/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
see you


[5/30/2021 6:08 PM] the.mightydill
so


[5/30/2021 6:08 PM] the.mightydill
i would do this


[5/30/2021 6:09 PM] the.mightydill
but then i had this idea


[5/30/2021 6:09 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[5/30/2021 6:09 PM] the.mightydill
bad idea idk


[5/30/2021 6:09 PM] the.mightydill
so. i make a new system, then transplant /lib from new lfs to old lfs.


[5/30/2021 6:09 PM] tux_linux
Yes, that might work


[5/30/2021 6:10 PM] the.mightydill
the problem is. that thing is multilib...


[5/30/2021 6:10 PM] tux_linux
The scripts?


[5/30/2021 6:10 PM] the.mightydill
yes


[5/30/2021 6:10 PM] tux_linux
And you did not build LFS multilib?


[5/30/2021 6:11 PM] the.mightydill
...no? its a pure 64 bit system...?


[5/30/2021 6:11 PM] tux_linux
You should try it still


[5/30/2021 6:11 PM] tux_linux
Maybe it'll work


[5/30/2021 6:11 PM] tux_linux
At worst, take the libs in lib64 instead

cp lib64 on broken lfs to lib on broken lfs?


[5/30/2021 6:12 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[5/30/2021 6:12 PM] the.mightydill
wait. i could do that instead of making lfs again


[5/30/2021 6:12 PM] tux_linux
What?


[5/30/2021 6:13 PM] tux_linux
Well idk if it will work


[5/30/2021 6:13 PM] the.mightydill
broken lfs: cp /lib64/* /lib/*


[5/30/2021 6:13 PM] the.mightydill
in any case i'll make a backup as well


[5/30/2021 7:23 PM] the.mightydill
first time to backup

@tux-linux hang on... isnt lib a symlink to usr/lib???


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
Usually, no


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
`lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    7 May 26 14:16 lib -> usr/lib` on arch/bedrock/debian at least. let me check lfs


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
on gentoo lib isn't symlinked


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] tux_linux
and gentoo is closer to LFS than arch or debian


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
not in lfs :/


[5/30/2021 7:30 PM] the.mightydill
yep


[5/30/2021 7:50 PM] the.mightydill
tarring it up.....


[5/30/2021 8:49 PM] ninuje
Might even be able to re-purpose a gentoo stage3?


[5/30/2021 8:50 PM] ninuje
that's essentially an LFS-that-works ;p

@tux-linux Will this affect my backup?


[5/31/2021 12:24 AM] tux_linux
Probably not


[5/31/2021 12:24 AM] the.mightydill
just to be safe, it's tarring again. but with sudo


[5/31/2021 12:24 AM] the.mightydill
i might just replace sudo with doas


[5/31/2021 12:27 AM] tux_linux
Always tar a backup like that with sudo

[5/31/2021 1:37 AM] the.mightydill
the lib64 thing won't work, there are only 2 libraries inside


[5/31/2021 1:38 AM] the.mightydill
time for lfs-scripts?


[5/31/2021 1:38 AM] tux_linux
yes, probably


[5/31/2021 1:38 AM] the.mightydill
also before that i found something on the internet that said "cp /lib from the livecd of your distro to /lib of broken install"


[5/31/2021 1:39 AM] the.mightydill
there are lots of lfs livecds...


[5/31/2021 1:39 AM] tux_linux
that's a very, very, very bad idea


[5/31/2021 1:39 AM] the.mightydill
why

ah


[5/31/2021 1:40 AM] the.mightydill
`./01-toolchain && sudo ./02-base && sudo ./03-mkiso`
let's see. i'll do a `bash -e` just in case

`sudo` before 01


[5/31/2021 1:42 AM] the.mightydill
are you sure


[5/31/2021 1:42 AM] tux_linux
well


[5/31/2021 1:42 AM] the.mightydill
i dont think youre supposed to make the toolchain as root


[5/31/2021 1:43 AM] the.mightydill
let me check lfs site


[5/31/2021 1:43 AM] tux_linux
if you really want to take no risk, just run that in a vm


[5/31/2021 1:44 AM] the.mightydill
there's no risk.


[5/31/2021 1:44 AM] the.mightydill
/mnt/lfs isnt mounted


[5/31/2021 1:44 AM] tux_linux
oh, don't forget to mount it then

```dill@bedrock:~/lfs-scripts$ sudo ./01-toolchain && sudo ./02-base && sudo ./03-mkiso
[sudo] password for dill: 
./01-toolchain script need to run as regular user!
dill@bedrock:~/lfs-scripts$```nope...


[5/31/2021 1:44 AM] the.mightydill
cant i just make an lfs chroot...


[5/31/2021 1:44 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[5/31/2021 1:45 AM] tux_linux
well, find the line where it creates /mnt/lfs and add sudo before

*facepalm*


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] tux_linux
no, seriously, you're doing that on bedrock?


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] the.mightydill
yep...


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] the.mightydill
where else would i do it


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] tux_linux
couldn't you just use standard debian?


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] the.mightydill
uh


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] the.mightydill
i dont have debian; i have bedrock


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] tux_linux
everything will fail if you continue like that


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] tux_linux
No, I mean real debian


[5/31/2021 1:49 AM] tux_linux
Like, maybe a liveusb?


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] tux_linux
since you're installing it on a mountpoint


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] the.mightydill
mountpoint


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] tux_linux
...?


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] the.mightydill
...cant i install on *not* a mountpoint


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] the.mightydill
like, empty $LFS


[5/31/2021 1:50 AM] the.mightydill
i.e. test it out in a chroot first


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] tux_linux
well, you can chroot into a mountpoint too


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] the.mightydill
that would make changes to current lfs which im a bit... worried about ;p


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] the.mightydill
i'd test it in a chroot first


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] tux_linux
`dd if=/dev/zero of=lfs.img bs=1M count=32768`


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] tux_linux
this will create a 32G disk image


[5/31/2021 1:51 AM] the.mightydill
why


[5/31/2021 1:52 AM] tux_linux
well, it's more portable?


[5/31/2021 1:52 AM] tux_linux
or you can use `qemu-img`

can use chroot. whats the problem with a chroot


[5/31/2021 1:52 AM] tux_linux
advantage with qemu-img is you can create an image and it expands as you use the storage space


[5/31/2021 1:52 AM] tux_linux
no, use an image that you can mount like a hard drive


[5/31/2021 1:52 AM] the.mightydill

`qemu-img create -f qcow2 lfs.img 60G`


[5/31/2021 1:53 AM] tux_linux
that creates a ... 135KiB disk image

[6/6/2021 12:49 AM] the.mightydill
messaging from lineage OS, btw


[6/6/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
better get used to it, because palemoon is the worst thing I've ever tried to compile


[6/6/2021 12:50 AM] tux_linux
access it over ssh if you want


[6/6/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill
yes, ssh is a good idea


[6/6/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill
wdym? errors?


[6/6/2021 12:58 AM] the.mightydill
or ram


[6/6/2021 12:59 AM] tux_linux
both


[6/6/2021 12:59 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[6/6/2021 1:00 AM] the.mightydill
is there a lightweight distro with gui (wm?)


[6/6/2021 1:02 AM] the.mightydill
preferably i3


[6/6/2021 1:02 AM] the.mightydill
alpine with i3?


[6/6/2021 1:06 AM] tux_linux
yeah, that could do if you really don't want to just use SSH


[6/6/2021 1:07 AM] the.mightydill
i've done some pretty stupid things over SSH


[6/6/2021 1:07 AM] the.mightydill
(i.e. LFS)


[6/6/2021 1:10 AM] tux_linux
Well, you should learn not to repeat these errors anymore, because SSH will become more and more useful as you'll be using Linux


[6/6/2021 1:12 AM] the.mightydill
yes. i should


[6/6/2021 1:13 AM] the.mightydill
ssh is especially useful as i like to listen to music and use discord while compiling 😬


[6/6/2021 1:33 AM] the.mightydill
...the audio jack doesn't work


[6/6/2021 1:33 AM] the.mightydill
welp


[6/6/2021 1:34 AM] tux_linux
I don't have an audio jack on my rpi 400 ;p


[6/6/2021 1:34 AM] the.mightydill
haha


[6/6/2021 1:34 AM] the.mightydill
well, same thing ;p


[6/6/2021 1:34 AM] the.mightydill
(since this one doesn't work)


[6/6/2021 1:37 AM] the.mightydill
well time to install alpine i guess


[6/6/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
alpine installed


[6/6/2021 9:13 PM] the.mightydill
ssh is being weird


[6/6/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
also, how would i go about building LFS on BTRFS?


[6/6/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
btrfs has snapshots which i need


[6/6/2021 9:14 PM] the.mightydill
also i cant build from a liveusb because too little ram and buying more ram is not worth it


[6/6/2021 10:29 PM] the.mightydill
aaaaa fsck it


[6/6/2021 10:29 PM] the.mightydill
im installing arch on this rpi


[6/7/2021 7:05 AM] tux_linux
You could set up a chroot on Arch with Alpine
Would that be more convenient?


[6/7/2021 7:06 AM] tux_linux
Maybe? Btrfs doesn't have a particularly great reputation regarding stability and reliability though...


[6/8/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
yep


[6/8/2021 12:43 AM] the.mightydill
apk just makes me so mad :/


[6/8/2021 2:37 AM] tux_linux
You can download the mini rootfs and start from there


[6/8/2021 4:45 AM] the.mightydill
Pacman 6.0.0 is *fast*


[6/8/2021 4:49 AM] ferminolaiz
Have you tried zfs?


[6/8/2021 4:49 AM] the.mightydill
Nope, is it good?


[6/8/2021 4:49 AM] ferminolaiz
Definitely yes


[6/8/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
I.e. better than btrfs


[6/8/2021 4:50 AM] ferminolaiz
Tbh I haven't tried btrfs but so far I've read it's better


[6/8/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
Ah. I'll try it


[6/8/2021 4:50 AM] ferminolaiz
I mean most of btrfs (if not all) features are in zfs and it's just more mature


[6/8/2021 4:50 AM] the.mightydill
Thanks


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] ferminolaiz
How much ram do you have?


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
8g


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
Wait no


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] ferminolaiz
You'll be fine


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
That's on Rpi :/


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] the.mightydill
4g


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] ferminolaiz
You'll be okay too


[6/8/2021 4:51 AM] ferminolaiz
Is it a 64 bit processor?


[6/8/2021 4:52 AM] ferminolaiz
(I'd tell you to read a bit about zfs before going for it, as the more you get what's going under the hood the better you'll be able to set it up, but IMHO you'll be amazed by it when you try it out :D)


[6/8/2021 5:01 AM] tux_linux
Yes it is (well I know it)
Btw, very nice to see you here again :DD


[6/8/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
You have military grade internet lucky you


[6/8/2021 5:03 AM] ferminolaiz
Thanks! I hop in every once in a while (I have the app in my phone)


[6/8/2021 5:03 AM] ferminolaiz
If it's x64 then ZFS on Linux will work just fine


[6/8/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
Don't know if you've seen what I'm preparing with InkBox but next release is gonna be huge


[6/8/2021 5:04 AM] tux_linux
(full X11/KoBox integration namely)


[6/8/2021 5:04 AM] ferminolaiz
Niceeee


[6/8/2021 5:05 AM] ferminolaiz
Is there any place I can take a look at the progress so far? I feel I've missed a ton hahahah


[6/8/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, like I bridged Qt and X
So you can launch apps with a simple tap


[6/8/2021 5:05 AM] tux_linux

There for boot things, main scripts are in initrd/common


[6/8/2021 5:06 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh btw if you're on arch you might want to have an lts kernel as zol (zfs on Linux) as far as I can tell doesn't support kernel 5.12


[6/8/2021 5:06 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll take a look :D

[6/8/2021 5:08 AM] tux_linux
Maybe you'll find that I am too concerned about security, but well I like how it's designed and how all the pieces finally start to match up together after months of exhaustive work


[6/8/2021 5:10 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, there's never "too much security", right?


[6/8/2021 5:10 AM] ferminolaiz
I bet! I mean, it's a ton of work for sure!


[6/8/2021 5:10 AM] tux_linux
My excessive use of OpenSSL and digital signatures is maybe a little too much?


[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
But I like to be serious


[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh, for the updates and so on? (I remember having read something about it)


[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, but also the rootfs gets verified at each boot and so does X11 things


[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] ferminolaiz
Nah, I think it's just fine and actually a good practice (that a ton of people don't care about)


[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] ferminolaiz
Oh, that's nice too

[6/8/2021 5:11 AM] ferminolaiz
Let's see


[6/8/2021 5:12 AM] tux_linux
Actually that script is a mess but it works


[6/8/2021 5:12 AM] ferminolaiz
Hahaha


[6/8/2021 5:12 AM] ferminolaiz
I'd say it's fine


[6/8/2021 5:13 AM] ferminolaiz
If people want to modify things, they probably know enough to  figure out what the script is doing


[6/8/2021 5:13 AM] ferminolaiz
Actually, secure boot is more or less the same thing


[6/8/2021 5:13 AM] tux_linux
Concept is you have extensions you can drag and drop in exportable storage and you can launch the app via GUI with one tap, seamlessly


[6/8/2021 5:13 AM] ferminolaiz
The kernel and it's modules, I believe, get verified on each boot


[6/8/2021 5:14 AM] tux_linux
Wanted to enable that but seemed a little out of my knowledge, although I did modify some of the U-Boot code


[6/8/2021 5:14 AM] ferminolaiz
(But the keys are propietary and embedded in the hardware)


[6/8/2021 5:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, for secure boot you'd need UEGI


[6/8/2021 5:14 AM] ferminolaiz
UEFI**


[6/8/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux
There's HAB for imx


[6/8/2021 5:15 AM] ferminolaiz

[6/8/2021 5:15 AM] tux_linux

yes?


[6/12/2021 4:54 AM] the.mightydill
- building LFS with systemd
- building on zfs (how? I assume enable it in the kernel and install xfs-progs before booting into LFS)


[6/12/2021 4:55 AM] tux_linux
Should be possible


[6/12/2021 4:55 AM] the.mightydill
i also assume there's a systemd edition


[6/12/2021 4:56 AM] the.mightydill
of LFS (I know there's one for BLFS IIRC)


[6/12/2021 4:56 AM] tux_linux

[6/12/2021 4:57 AM] the.mightydill
also, grabbing the sources from the broken one instead of downloading them?


[6/12/2021 4:57 AM] tux_linux
if you stay on the same edition, it should be good, but since you want to go with systemd, i suggest you download them all and start clean


[6/12/2021 4:58 AM] the.mightydill
yep sure, although the old one has systemd sources as well ;p

[6/12/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
yes

how's inkbox development going?


[6/17/2021 4:09 AM] tux_linux
1.5 will probably never see the light of the day 😂 
It's been months and I still have improvements to make for a real release


[6/17/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
heh...


[6/17/2021 4:09 AM] the.mightydill
what kind of improvements


[6/17/2021 4:10 AM] tux_linux
well, not always improvements, but I have to do billions of usecase testing for each function in the OS to see if every single situation will be covered appropriately


[6/17/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[6/17/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
and thus, correct the billions of mistakes I made when I was coding the tested program


[6/17/2021 4:11 AM] the.mightydill
try not to make too many features tho, or it'll be an absolute beast to debug


[6/17/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
It already has too much features


[6/17/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
and it's already a hassle to debug


[6/17/2021 4:12 AM] the.mightydill
then remove some


[6/17/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
No, I like them
I know no one knows inkbox os as well as myself, but I'm willing to go down a rabbit hole of debug issues if a problem happens


[6/17/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
(and I've already done that ... several times a week)


[6/17/2021 4:13 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[6/17/2021 4:13 AM] tux_linux
But it has become so demanding that sometimes you feel that the Kobo's slowed down


[6/17/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
though, that's with 800mhz processors and 256mb ram
If I port that to the Glo HD or the Clara, that probably won't be an issue


[6/17/2021 4:14 AM] the.mightydill
yes, try to keep it minimal on the less powerful models


[6/17/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
No, please... I'm already struggling to do a single release, not gonna start to strip some features or I'm gonna go crazy


[6/17/2021 4:15 AM] the.mightydill
oh yeah that's tough...


[6/17/2021 4:16 AM] the.mightydill
don't stress yourself out, work on one thing at a time 😄


[6/17/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
yeah... I hope that at least, I will have some (big) recognition by people when I finally get that release out

And I'm wondering if I do the mupdf thing for 1.5 or 1.6


[6/17/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
yes, it's a big thing


[6/17/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
But will people realize it?


[6/17/2021 4:18 AM] the.mightydill
yeah...


[6/17/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
actually, already made major changes to some scripts (not easily revertible), so I have my answer


[6/17/2021 4:19 AM] the.mightydill
1.5?


[6/17/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, I'll do it for 1.5, it's just lots and lots of refactoring since mutool works in a completely different way than the other method I used before, unless you want to wait 2+ minutes for the book to open


[6/17/2021 4:21 AM] the.mightydill
oh that sucks...


[6/17/2021 4:21 AM] tux_linux
so I'll do it one-page-at-a-time kind of thing, will load roughly 2-3 secs/page turn, so guess it's better than 2minutes


[6/17/2021 4:22 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, it's similar to nickel's amount of time


[6/17/2021 4:23 AM] tux_linux
I'm just feeling that my brain holds too much things now and I have like a metric ton of work to do for the reader framework, I look forward to finally just publishing that and not worrying about it for two or three weeks

hey guys, I have a question if any of you have a sec


[6/28/2021 6:26 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm trying to backup a huge stream to tapes, and I can't figure out a way to span the backup to multiple tapes. I know I can do tar -M and that works fine, but so far I've tried tar needs a list of files, and I only have a stream of data (zfs send). I was thinking of using split but I don't know if there's a way to mimic tar's behavior of telling me "hey dude change the tape" and waiting for me to tell it to continue.


[6/28/2021 6:26 PM] ferminolaiz
thanks though 😄


[6/28/2021 6:32 PM] pgaskin
Split with the filter option, maybe?


[6/28/2021 6:33 PM] pgaskin
@fermino


[6/28/2021 7:23 PM] tux_linux
You mean... real tapes? cool!
So you have a big data stream to send to tapes. I suppose you send that stream to some `/dev/*` device? And you `split` the stream to multiple files... But you cannot keep the files on the disk since it's too huge, right? Thus, you need to find a way to tell `split` to stop each time the tape's full and let it continue. Have I understood correctly?...


[6/28/2021 7:25 PM] tux_linux
Maybe you'll find something in the --filter option, as pgaskin said

[6/29/2021 4:10 AM] ferminolaiz
That's neat, thank you both! (sorry for not responding before, busy day). I think it should work well; I just need to figure out how much space there's actually in the tape. They're advertised as 400GB, but I'll have to try that out.


[6/29/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
that must take hours to back up ...


[6/29/2021 4:11 AM] ferminolaiz
I'll probably end up making a script to grab the snapshot, split it, and then pipe it through pv to be able to actually see how far it's come


[6/29/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
good idea, yes


[6/29/2021 4:11 AM] ferminolaiz
YES. I think it's writing at ~60MB/s


[6/29/2021 4:11 AM] tux_linux
That fast?


[6/29/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
I thought tapes were even slower


[6/29/2021 4:12 AM] tux_linux
Or it's some professional-grade tape I'd guess


[6/29/2021 4:12 AM] ferminolaiz
Supposedly LTO-3 drives can go up to 80MB/s. Tested taking from /dev/zero and it reached 82 i think, but with real data it goes down


[6/29/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Sort of, it's kind of old but it's supposed to be enterprise grade; found it on mercadolibre.com (ebay-like, local) reaally cheap


[6/29/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
nice


[6/29/2021 4:14 AM] tux_linux
What drive are you using to read/write to it?


[6/29/2021 4:14 AM] ferminolaiz
Its an HP Ultrium 1760 (SAS)


[6/29/2021 4:15 AM] tux_linux
nice


[6/29/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
and I guess there's no random access to the data


[6/29/2021 4:16 AM] ferminolaiz
Nope


[6/29/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
so you have to read it all to see some particular file you need


[6/29/2021 4:16 AM] tux_linux
\*nice\*


[6/29/2021 4:16 AM] ferminolaiz
Well, I guess if you know where it's at you could just fast forward there


[6/29/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
It's not compressed data, right?


[6/29/2021 4:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Not really


[6/29/2021 4:17 AM] ferminolaiz
i mean, the drive has some sort of compression algorithm already; but besides that I'm not using anything


[6/29/2021 4:17 AM] tux_linux
couldn't you make an xz pipe on-the-fly to speed things up?


[6/29/2021 4:17 AM] ferminolaiz
Yeap


[6/29/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
But well, this is an Atom D525


[6/29/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
So....


[6/29/2021 4:18 AM] tux_linux
Ouch


[6/29/2021 4:18 AM] ferminolaiz
Might benchmark it with gzip or lz4


[6/29/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
Now let's do the math of "Is backing up uncompressed data to tape faster than doing it with an xz pipe but seriously heavy-loading the CPU"...


[6/29/2021 4:19 AM] ferminolaiz
Also, I'm still thinking between going for zfs send, or actually using tar for it. The problem with zfs send is that if I have any problem with one tape, the whole snapshot is unusable. With tar, it should be a little bit more reliable


[6/29/2021 4:19 AM] tux_linux
You could use zfs send and pipe that to XZ to make a raw compressed dump


[6/29/2021 4:20 AM] tux_linux
`zfs send (or whatever your data stream comes from) | split file ... | xz > file.xz`


[6/29/2021 4:20 AM] ferminolaiz
This is without anything besides the drive ;-;

[6/30/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
the problem with it is that at low speeds it "shoe shines"


[6/30/2021 3:55 PM] ferminolaiz
The drive head goes back and forth and it wears down the drive and the tape


[6/30/2021 3:56 PM] ferminolaiz
So supposedly I should go at least at ~85MB/s to avoid that :/


[6/30/2021 3:59 PM] ferminolaiz
btw I gave up on trying to store the whole zfs snapshots because one error would render the whole thing unusable

tar totally wrecks the CPU. The max throughput I'm getting is ~70MB/s but totally maxing out a CPU core

The other option would be to force tar to use one core and the buffer/dd to use another


[6/30/2021 4:51 PM] tux_linux
I've never done that, but multiple cores using tar should be enabled by default

Though 7-zip has its limits and doesn't handle Linux ext4 things very well sometimes

I'm running zfs, though


[6/30/2021 4:55 PM] tux_linux

[6/30/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
maybe `cpio`?


[6/30/2021 4:56 PM] ferminolaiz
(Another problem is that the tape itself has internal compression, so even if I feed it 80megs/sec but it's compressible data it would shoe-shine it as well)

But... couldn't you like mount a remote folder via sshfs containing the compressed files/stream or is it only on the machine?


[6/30/2021 4:58 PM] ferminolaiz
It is only in the machine


[6/30/2021 4:58 PM] tux_linux
then, sshfs from the machine to remote


[6/30/2021 4:59 PM] tux_linux
and back to the local machine with compressed streams from a faster computer

Hmm


[6/30/2021 5:37 PM] ferminolaiz
Now I'm lost


[6/30/2021 5:38 PM] ferminolaiz
it seems that tar's multi-volume option closes/EOF's the stdout after finishing the first volume, so the second volume doesnt' go through the buffer but get's sent to the terminal :/


[6/30/2021 5:39 PM] ferminolaiz
`tar --tape-length=1G -cMf - /home/fermino | mbuffer -m1G -P50 -R70M -q -l /mbuffer.log | dd of=/dev/st0 bs=8M status=progress`


[6/30/2021 5:39 PM] tux_linux
so after first volume, output is redirected to console, like stderr or something?


[6/30/2021 5:39 PM] ferminolaiz
yeap


[6/30/2021 5:39 PM] ferminolaiz
mbuffer and dd exit


[6/30/2021 5:40 PM] tux_linux
maybe there's an option to tell pipes to grab all output?

[6/30/2021 5:40 PM] tux_linux
maybe?


[6/30/2021 5:40 PM] ferminolaiz
The thing is that


[6/30/2021 5:40 PM] ferminolaiz
I don't think it gets sent to stderr


[6/30/2021 5:41 PM] tux_linux
Well it must be sent to *something*


[6/30/2021 5:41 PM] ferminolaiz
But rather that mbuffer detects the EOF and closes the fd


[6/30/2021 5:41 PM] ferminolaiz
I'll try nulling stderr to see what happens

{Reactions}
👍 

[6/30/2021 5:43 PM] ferminolaiz
Nope, it's still stdout


[6/30/2021 5:43 PM] tux_linux
Uh?


[6/30/2021 5:44 PM] tux_linux
so it sends an EOF and then the output gets to stdout, but before it is piped?


[6/30/2021 5:44 PM] ferminolaiz
No


[6/30/2021 5:44 PM] ferminolaiz
Like


[6/30/2021 5:44 PM] ferminolaiz
The whole thing works for the first volume


[6/30/2021 5:45 PM] ferminolaiz
Then tar (supposedly) sends an EOF and prompts the user to change the tape. I press enter and the thing doesn't get pip'd anymore


[6/30/2021 5:45 PM] ferminolaiz
`tar --tape-length=1G -cMf - /home/fermino 2>/dev/null | mbuffer -m1G -P50 -R70M -q -l /mbuffer.log 2>/dev/null | dd of=/dev/st0 bs=8M status=progress 2>/dev/null`


[6/30/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
that's becoming a scripting nightmare definitely


[6/30/2021 5:45 PM] ferminolaiz
I guess you can try it out, just change the dd output


[6/30/2021 5:45 PM] tux_linux
ok


[6/30/2021 5:46 PM] ferminolaiz
Yeah, literally all the options lead to this


[6/30/2021 5:46 PM] ferminolaiz
Wheter it's just trying to get a progress bar / avoid shoe shinning / whatever


[6/30/2021 5:47 PM] ferminolaiz
Maybe I just need to split the folders in half hahahahah


[6/30/2021 5:47 PM] tux_linux
I'd do something like (pseudo code)
`if read line EOF < stream; then restart process with vol. nb`?


[6/30/2021 5:48 PM] ferminolaiz
hmm yeah


[6/30/2021 5:48 PM] ferminolaiz
That might actually work


[6/30/2021 5:49 PM] ferminolaiz
I mean, if there's anything that helps me handle EOF without closing the fd (I mean, I'm guessing an EOF. Couldn't if be that it also closes the fd too?, IDK)


[6/30/2021 5:50 PM] tux_linux
that's out of my knowledge, sorry 😬

[6/30/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[6/30/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
So a fifo could maybe be of help


[6/30/2021 5:54 PM] ferminolaiz
Waittt.... I'm guessing: The tape reports an EOF when it's about to run out of space (that's a special kernel thing for the tapes), so tar handles that by prompting for a new tape


[6/30/2021 5:54 PM] ferminolaiz
So,


[6/30/2021 5:54 PM] tux_linux
yes ...


[6/30/2021 5:55 PM] ferminolaiz
What if the --tape-size is the actual thing that is closing the fd?


[6/30/2021 5:55 PM] tux_linux
but then, you'd have to handle changing tapes with another way


[6/30/2021 5:55 PM] ferminolaiz
I still can pass it a -M and let the autodetect feature work its way


[6/30/2021 5:55 PM] tux_linux
Then what happens if you try without?


[6/30/2021 5:56 PM] ferminolaiz
I'm using the --tape-length just to try it out without waiting 2 hours


[6/30/2021 5:56 PM] ferminolaiz
I'll put a smaller tape and try that out

[6/30/2021 7:17 PM] ferminolaiz

[6/30/2021 7:17 PM] ferminolaiz
I mean... _in theory_ it should work


[6/30/2021 7:17 PM] tux_linux
maybe


[6/30/2021 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Has anyone ever experienced something like this? I got a string, "true", which is read from a file using `cat` and put into an env var. That string contains a new line character "\n" which I thought bash/ash didn't make a difference between that and the string which didn't have one. So, with that in mind, I compare the var:
```
if [ "$STARTX" == " true" ]; then
  do something
fi
```
Initially, I did `echo "true" > /mnt/flags/X11_START`, which is the file holding this value. The comparison equals false when done.
Now, if I do `echo -n "true" > /mnt/flags/X11_START`, the comparison equals true.
Like ... why ... on ... earth ...?


[6/30/2021 8:05 PM] ninuje
Because the LF matters


[6/30/2021 8:06 PM] tux_linux
really? I've already done tens and tens of string comparisons with \n in the file/string and it returned true


[6/30/2021 8:06 PM] ninuje
Nothing strips it until you ask for that explicitly


[6/30/2021 8:06 PM] ninuje
`[[ "true" != "true\n" ]] && echo "true ;)"`


[6/30/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
Maybe is it because I did `echo` that with the `fish` shell


[6/30/2021 8:08 PM] ninuje
I don't use fish, but `echo -n` is not portable, and has a long list of weird quirks


[6/30/2021 8:08 PM] ninuje
Just use `printf`


[6/30/2021 8:08 PM] tux_linux
I tried with bash now, let's see what it returns


[6/30/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
And it seems to work (with a newline character). So fish's `echo` is not for that job


[6/30/2021 8:09 PM] tux_linux
Yeah fish is not POSIX-compliant at all, I'd love if it was, but I mainly use it because it remembers everything I do and I can just tab/right arrow for command completions


[6/30/2021 8:11 PM] tux_linux
Here's `cat -A`'s output. First 5 flags were done with fish's `echo` (no `-n`) and the last one with bash's `echo` (again, no `-n`)
```
gentoo-linux /run/media/nicolas/341C02201C01DE2C/inkbox-img # cat -A /mnt/flags/*
false$
true$
false$
false$
false$
true $
```


[6/30/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
Interestingly enough, the `FIRST_BOOT` flag which was written with fish got recognized by the OS at boot. No idea why `X11_START` didn't. Anyways, I re-did that with bash now, hopefully all will work well, thanks


[6/30/2021 8:15 PM] ninuje
Something (cat or the substitution itself) might be stripping trailing newlines in some circumstances

I'll see if I can make you that by tomorrow maybe
But if you want to test it out better, you should get your hands on one of the three supported models if you can. Because X11 won't run with Nickel. I'll publish a video soon with all the features demoed.

So. Do I wipe Nickel on the Libra and start working on InkBox, or do I work on NickelBoot for the Mini?


[7/8/2021 2:29 AM] the.mightydill
InkBox


[7/8/2021 2:29 AM] the.mightydill
well it depends on what *you* want to do ;p

InkBox 1.6 is out!
http://pkgs.kobox.fermino.me/bundles/inkbox/native/update/1.6/
It introduces a "Go to page" function and the search button now does something when you click it. Also, a VNC viewer (based on krdc from the KDE project) is included for users with rooted devices

well 1.6 is out now ;p


[7/13/2021 1:26 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Yeah. I saw in that thread that @tux-linux was considering a Clara HD build and I just got one so I figured maybe I could help as a tester if that ends up happening.


[7/13/2021 1:51 AM] tux_linux
Sure, I was thinking about that lately. Sure it would be awesome! Already testing on my Libra which has an eMMC, so a lot more dangerous but it works, so a bit of the hard work is already done for kernel/hardware porting. I could provide you instructions for initial porting/testing.
How much are you familiar with Linux in general?


[7/13/2021 1:53 AM] fxfyu1v12678
I'm not much of a developer (just a little), but I've been a user for years now.


[7/13/2021 1:54 AM] tux_linux
Cool. Now for kernel porting, a serial connection to the device would be ideal. Dunno if you'd be willing to open your device... though, it's the best debugging way we have.


[7/13/2021 1:54 AM] tux_linux
(also, opening it would be necessary to reflash the internal microSD card)


[7/13/2021 1:55 AM] tux_linux
(which you can backup before)


[7/13/2021 1:56 AM] fxfyu1v12678
iirc they're pretty easy to open


[7/13/2021 1:56 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Shouldn't be a problem


[7/13/2021 1:56 AM] tux_linux
Do you have an USB-to-serial adapter/Arduino/Raspi you could plug the wires in?


[7/13/2021 1:57 AM] fxfyu1v12678
I should have a couple lying around


[7/13/2021 1:58 AM] tux_linux
Then I think you're good


[7/13/2021 1:58 AM] tux_linux
Honestly, you can just put toothpicks to hold the wires in place and never solder them


[7/13/2021 1:58 AM] tux_linux
that's what I do all the time


[7/13/2021 2:01 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Probably what I'll do


[7/13/2021 2:01 AM] tux_linux
When would you be willing to start experimenting?


[7/13/2021 2:02 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Might be able to open it sometime this week

[7/13/2021 3:47 AM] fxfyu1v12678
damn, mainline kernel


[7/13/2021 3:47 AM] tux_linux
yeap, they're lucky


[7/13/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
Don't know if for InkBox I'm going to choose that option. Read about the waveform a bit... Though, 4.1.15 kernel is still fine IMO


[7/13/2021 3:49 AM] tux_linux
On older devices (e.g. Mini, Touch, Glo) I had to stick with 2.6.35.3 🤮


[7/13/2021 3:50 AM] tux_linux
I mean, after some time you find workarounds for certain things that won't work and adapt, but it's still a mess to handle. E.g., can't run decent rootfs with glibc versions > 2017 because of `FATAL: Kernel too old!`


[7/13/2021 3:50 AM] fxfyu1v12678
y i k e s
That's what's nice about mainline support - it'll be there once kobo give up


[7/13/2021 3:51 AM] tux_linux
At least, yes.
Thing is, Kobo has already given up for Touch/Mini/Glo since a long time and I don't know if somebody is going to look into porting a newer kernel (I'm not at the level of porting a kernel myself)
musl libc is there to assure compatibility though at least


[7/13/2021 3:58 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Yeah. I'm sure mainline is possible, but probably not worth the effort for anyone.


[7/13/2021 3:59 AM] tux_linux
yep, especially given the fact that 2.6 was pre-dtc/dts/dtb

[7/13/2021 4:37 AM] tux_linux
Wow


[7/13/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
that could be a very good project


[7/13/2021 4:37 AM] the.mightydill
inkbox as an app


[7/13/2021 4:38 AM] tux_linux
Honestly I'm not sure they'll be able to 'package' it as they say


[7/13/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
The underlying infrastructure is so complicated that most of the features (X11, namely) won't be available.
Though, getting basic reader stuff work would not be too much of a hassle I'd think


[7/13/2021 4:39 AM] the.mightydill
yep, that is true. there would be no point in packaging X11 tho.


[7/13/2021 4:39 AM] tux_linux
it is already in pmOS, yeah


[7/13/2021 4:40 AM] tux_linux
Well, someone could fork it, and just writing "false" to /boot/flags/X11_START is already a good start for disabling it


[7/13/2021 4:40 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, or simply forking + removing X11 from InkBox entirely


[7/13/2021 4:42 AM] tux_linux
I think keeping the main build on upstream would be good for them, and honestly there isn't much more to modify to hide X11 options entirely.
It's as simple as that: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/218b64ef7f696e3830df3b4ba2e5702ff8197a70/apps.cpp#L29-L40


[7/13/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
yeah, but X11 would make the package heavier


[7/13/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
why?


[7/13/2021 4:43 AM] tux_linux
it's -- separate --


[7/13/2021 4:43 AM] the.mightydill
(as in, taking up more space)


[7/13/2021 4:44 AM] tux_linux
No, well, I think it would remove a few KB from the program, not much to worry about


[7/13/2021 4:44 AM] the.mightydill
ah


[7/13/2021 4:59 AM] fxfyu1v12678
legit these things are harder to put back together than to take apart wtf


[7/13/2021 5:00 AM] tux_linux
I've had a similar issue with my Touch


[7/13/2021 5:01 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Damn. The back pops rights off easy.


[7/13/2021 5:01 AM] fxfyu1v12678
But I had to push inwards and down pretty hard to get it back on.


[7/13/2021 5:01 AM] fxfyu1v12678
I think once I start messing with it I'll tape the back on loosely to avoid too much on/off cycling.


[7/13/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
yeah sure


[7/13/2021 5:02 AM] tux_linux
If you have a case you can probably just put it back inside without a tape


[7/13/2021 5:02 AM] fxfyu1v12678
No case yet sadly.


[7/13/2021 5:03 AM] tux_linux
Ah. You should consider buying one. those things are fragile


[7/13/2021 5:03 AM] fxfyu1v12678
Yeah, I'm planning on it. Still deciding which one.

do you have any docs on the mainline driver for the epaper display?


[7/13/2021 4:51 PM] martijnbraam
it seems to do interesting things with the grayscale value ranges


[7/13/2021 4:53 PM] tux_linux
I know that the waveform is needed to display anything beyond black and white and it is located at sector 14336 of the SD card


[7/13/2021 4:54 PM] tux_linux
It gets loaded by U-Boot when booting and is passed to the kernel as cmdline arguments in the form of memory addresses

postmarketOS on the Kobo Clara HD
jetomit managed to figure out how to boot a mainline Linux kernel on the Kobo Clara HD, an ereader from 2018.

I'm running the Sxmo UI on it to test, most of the Sxmo UI is optimized for the PinePhone though so it's pretty hard to actually use a bunch of things. Mainly due to missing 2 of the 3 hardware input buttons.

oh it works, but it does interesting things


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
That's eink


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] martijnbraam
it seems like grayscale values from 0-63 give the full black-white range


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] martijnbraam
and the next 64 the same


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] martijnbraam
for 4 grayscale ranges in total


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] martijnbraam
but they behave different on refreshing


[7/13/2021 4:56 PM] tux_linux
Are you in 32bpp mode?


[7/13/2021 4:57 PM] martijnbraam
yes, but I'm just setting gray pixels so the math in the kernel maps it 1=1 to 8-bit gray


[7/13/2021 4:58 PM] tux_linux
What? Sorry, you lost me


[7/13/2021 4:58 PM] martijnbraam
yes the kernel is in RGBX8888


[7/13/2021 4:58 PM] tux_linux
So you're trying to print gray pixels all over the screen, right?


[7/13/2021 4:58 PM] martijnbraam
and the kernel driver seems to convert that to grayscale for the panel

that background is one long grayscale gradient from black to white


[7/13/2021 4:59 PM] tux_linux
Ouch


[7/13/2021 4:59 PM] martijnbraam
it seems like 2 bits of the grayscale color are used for a mode instead


[7/13/2021 5:00 PM] tux_linux
Ok now I see


[7/13/2021 5:00 PM] tux_linux
Did you hear about FBInk?

Pinging @NiLuJe there if he wants to join the discussion


[7/13/2021 5:01 PM] tux_linux
Did you try with the vendor kernel? Does it do the same thing?


[7/13/2021 5:02 PM] martijnbraam
it does  something else apparently, haven't tried that


[7/13/2021 5:02 PM] martijnbraam
I'm more interested in the mainline one 😛


[7/13/2021 5:03 PM] tux_linux
Sure
You could try printing that image on the screen with FBInk to be certain that it's not an X11 issue


[7/13/2021 5:03 PM] martijnbraam
fbink looks interesting


[7/13/2021 5:04 PM] tux_linux

[7/13/2021 5:06 PM] martijnbraam
yes that's a debug image


[7/13/2021 5:06 PM] martijnbraam
to figure out what it's doing


[7/13/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
It seems a bit distorted when the bars change colors; is it your phone or is it like that in real life?


[7/13/2021 5:07 PM] martijnbraam
that's real life


[7/13/2021 5:07 PM] martijnbraam
I guess that's the panel dithering


[7/13/2021 5:07 PM] martijnbraam
there are no bars at all in the source image, it's a smooth gradient


[7/13/2021 5:07 PM] tux_linux
Ahhh


[7/13/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
Ok that's really strange


[7/13/2021 5:08 PM] tux_linux
Where is your waveform stored? Still in the unpartitioned space?


[7/13/2021 5:08 PM] martijnbraam
the waveform is fine, I'm trying to figure out what the bits mean


[7/13/2021 5:09 PM] martijnbraam
but nobody writes any actual docs


[7/13/2021 5:09 PM] tux_linux
But shouldn't the image show correctly if the waveform is fine?


[7/13/2021 5:10 PM] martijnbraam
no because I'm not sending it the correct image data, it's rendering the 4 parts of the image in 4 different waveforms


[7/13/2021 5:10 PM] martijnbraam
but I'm trying to figure out what the waveforms mean

but yeah I hoped someone who worked with this driver was here

Nope, you'd have to ping the author (I'm not entirely sure this is in a finished/usable state, actually)


[7/13/2021 9:16 PM] martijnbraam
it definetly works


[7/13/2021 9:20 PM] ninuje
Right now it appears to be requesting `AUTO`, which, normally, asks the PxP to do an histogram analysis of the damaged area to return the index of the most appropriate wfm in the table for said damage


[7/13/2021 9:21 PM] martijnbraam
yeah but the 2 most significant bits of the grayscale also seems to affect the waveform


[7/13/2021 9:21 PM] ninuje
tl;dr: black box magic!


[7/13/2021 9:22 PM] ninuje
That would be specific to this kernel, then ;o)

You can try patching that and just requesting GC16, to rule out a PxP/AUTO mishap

I kinda want to be able to request DU also 😛


[7/13/2021 9:25 PM] ninuje
DU is plain black & white, so weird quantization and/or skipped damage is to be expected


[7/13/2021 9:25 PM] ninuje
(if the input doesn't fit the bill)


[7/13/2021 9:26 PM] martijnbraam
I know


[7/13/2021 9:26 PM] martijnbraam
it's also fast


[7/13/2021 9:26 PM] martijnbraam
great for keyboard highlights


[7/13/2021 9:26 PM] ninuje
Yup


[7/13/2021 9:27 PM] ninuje
(A sane & working AUTO should be pretty good at groking when to use DU, FWIW)


[7/13/2021 9:27 PM] ninuje
(It won't ever go so far as A2, but, DU, sure)


[7/13/2021 9:27 PM] tux_linux
Do those displays have A2?


[7/13/2021 9:27 PM] ninuje
They do, but it's even more stringent about saying eff u if the input isn't B&W 😉


[7/13/2021 9:28 PM] ninuje
(and the FORCE_MONOCHROME flag is... buggy as all hell)


[7/13/2021 9:28 PM] tux_linux
Hmm ok. So better to stick with DU then


[7/13/2021 9:28 PM] ninuje

[7/13/2021 9:31 PM] ninuje
Yeah, that one was *super* weird.


[7/13/2021 9:32 PM] ninuje
I mean, if you diff the Forma and the Libra's kernel, they're basically the same.


[7/13/2021 9:32 PM] ninuje
The HW is also pretty similar.


[7/13/2021 9:32 PM] ninuje
And I've never ever seen that happen on a Forma.


[7/13/2021 9:32 PM] ninuje
I've seen a Forma deadlock for no apparent reason, but, that, no ;p

Helo 👋


[7/15/2021 5:35 PM] tux_linux
And you are? (your GitHub name reminds me of something, but I can't tell where I saw it)


[7/15/2021 6:33 PM] maxnet
I'm Max, postmarketOS Contributor. Just saw Martijns ideo about the kobo clara, whcih made me thinking of buying a used one 😄


[7/15/2021 6:33 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it's very nice. They're a bit costly though these times


[7/15/2021 6:34 PM] maxnet
Yeah. But running them with a close-to-mainline kernel on pmOS with Inkbox would be a dream 🙂


[7/15/2021 6:35 PM] maxnet
FLOSS e-reader 😄


[7/15/2021 6:35 PM] tux_linux
Sure. But you'll probably not be happy with InkBox's way of doing things in the kernel...


[7/15/2021 6:35 PM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/initrd/common/rcS-root
That's what it does (InkBox OS) at boot


[7/15/2021 6:36 PM] tux_linux
Though, getting minimal reader functionality to work without all that is possible. But sadly X support will probably have to be designed separately, as the way I handle that in InkBox OS is kind of... complicated ;p
(https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/initrd/common/startx)


[7/15/2021 6:37 PM] tux_linux

[7/15/2021 7:48 PM] tux_linux
I got this !@#$ dhd.ko wi-fi driver working!
So probably Wi-Fi for all InkBox devices in the next update


[7/15/2021 7:57 PM] tux_linux
Hm. No, seems that another error has come up.
I do `iwlist eth0 scanning`
And (of course!) I get `eth0    Failed to scan data : Resource temporarily unavailable`
And ring buffer is saying this:
```
[   31.517891] Set ISCAN for wl_iw_iscan failed with 0
[   31.635547] CONSOLE: 
[   31.637827] CONSOLE: wl0: wlc_scan_request_ex, can not scan due to error -4
```


[7/15/2021 7:58 PM] tux_linux
This was *bound* to go wrong


[7/15/2021 8:07 PM] tux_linux
And it seems it does that with the default kernel/stock OS too
Interesting. Though, when Nickel has launched, magic happened and it works


[7/15/2021 8:13 PM] ninuje
Is `eth0` the right interface? I can never remember which ones use `wlan0` 😒


[7/15/2021 8:13 PM] tux_linux
It is always `eth0`


[7/15/2021 8:14 PM] tux_linux
Never seen `wlan0` on any Kobo


[7/15/2021 8:14 PM] ninuje
It's wlan0 on some older models, IIRC


[7/15/2021 8:14 PM] ninuje
And on the Elipsa, incidentally ;p


[7/15/2021 8:15 PM] tux_linux
Well, this is a Touch N905B, you can't get really older


[7/15/2021 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Seems that three modules are loaded; `dhd`, `sdio_wifi_pwr` and `lowmem`


[7/15/2021 8:18 PM] tux_linux
Wow, now `iwlist eth0 scanning` triggers a reboot


[7/15/2021 8:20 PM] ninuje
kernel panic?


[7/15/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
Also, do you know what `hindenburg` ever does?


[7/15/2021 8:20 PM] tux_linux
probably, but nothing has been printed on serial


[7/15/2021 8:21 PM] ninuje
Minor dbus/monitoring stuff. less and less as time goes by


[7/15/2021 8:21 PM] tux_linux
So nothing really related to wi-fi


[7/15/2021 8:27 PM] ninuje
It used to possibly handle scanning at one point in time


[7/15/2021 8:28 PM] tux_linux
I found some old scripts in /usr/local/Kobo from 2011. Doubting it still uses them, but at the time it seems they were using `wpa_cli`


[7/15/2021 8:32 PM] tux_linux
`OH THE HUMANITY!`
Some line from `strings /usr/local/Kobo/hindenburg`...


[7/15/2021 8:52 PM] tux_linux
Whew, reopened the issue. dhd.ko is the worst driver I've ever dealt with.

but is there source code for this at all?


[7/15/2021 9:04 PM] ninuje
(Never investigated this myself, I don't have affected HW)


[7/15/2021 9:06 PM] ninuje
In the dhd package, apparently


[7/15/2021 9:06 PM] tux_linux
oh


[7/15/2021 9:07 PM] ninuje
Broadcom being broadcom, I guess ;p


[7/15/2021 9:07 PM] the.mightydill
you bought one?


[7/15/2021 9:08 PM] tux_linux
That looks interesting
```
build@inkbox:~/wifi-mk3$ rgrep . | grep wlarm_le
Binary file src/wl/exe/wlarm_le matches
build@inkbox:~/wifi-mk3$ 
```


[7/15/2021 9:08 PM] tux_linux
So they included... the binary


[7/15/2021 9:08 PM] ninuje
Yup >_<". It would have been impossible to support otherwise, given how weird the kernel is


[7/15/2021 9:08 PM] tux_linux
And you kept it, since it's 15 days passed?


[7/15/2021 9:09 PM] ninuje
Well, i ran out of time to support all the things, so, i'll see what I can do, but it looks like it, yeah :/

There is a way to install it natively on a Libra (I have one myself) alongside Nickel (dual boot) but it's dangerous

Sorry for the late reply. As I happen to have a Libra H2O, I put some tweaks to allow touch input in the script that does that. Start KoBox, telnet/SSH into the Kobo, go in /mnt/user/root/.utils and there should be some python file in it. Uncomment the lines relative to the Libra H2O and restart your device, then relaunch KoBox. It should work.
If you need help, feel free to ask more

Hmm, my bad.
Restart the device, then
`killall nickel sickel hindenburg`
`echo 3 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate`

Touch the screen


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] btwarch147
its topped showing the error


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] btwarch147
but nothing appears to be registered on screen


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] tux_linux
Is the screen in landscape orientation?


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] btwarch147
yes


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] tux_linux
What if you click on 'applications'?


[8/28/2021 9:45 PM] btwarch147
clicking the applications button shows it switching desktops


[8/28/2021 9:46 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[8/28/2021 9:47 PM] btwarch147
It looks like the touch  is being inverted


[8/28/2021 9:47 PM] btwarch147
eg: touching applications activates buttons in the opposite corner


[8/28/2021 9:47 PM] tux_linux
is it landscape with the buttons pointing up?


[8/28/2021 9:48 PM] btwarch147
the buttons are at the bottom


[8/28/2021 9:48 PM] btwarch147
eg opposite to the applications bar


[8/28/2021 9:48 PM] tux_linux
So it is not like that? https://i.redd.it/uqsu96wm6ta61.jpg

then retry the commands I put above, but `echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate` instead

Hello, just learned about this awesome project and I must thank you for that. For years I've been looking for a FOSS ereader and this might be a good solution 😃
Any idea of supporting newer devices like the Libra H20, Claro, Elipsa ?


[9/17/2021 3:13 PM] tux_linux
Hello!
Thanks, the only device that might get support is the Clara HD because the Elipsa and Libra don't have a removable microSD card

Hi NiMa, just checking in from your GitHub discussion regarding support for Aura H2O (N250). What do you think?


[9/18/2021 1:11 PM] tux_linux
It would be doable. Apparently, it has an internal SD card. You'd have to setup a serial connection to debug the kernel (easy with a RPi or USB adapter and some toothpicks).
But is it a N250 or a N250B actually?


[9/18/2021 5:57 PM] foogit7823
It is indeed a N250 model.
Does that mean I have to open the case to access some internal contacts, or does it work over the USB port?


[9/18/2021 5:58 PM] foogit7823
Does that also mean, my model has two SD cards, one external for user access, and one internal for the OS?


[9/18/2021 5:59 PM] foogit7823
Trying to get a better understanding 🧐


[9/18/2021 6:03 PM] ninuje
There's an internal SD card slot & card, with both the OS and user storage


[9/18/2021 6:03 PM] ninuje
And there's an external SD card slot


[9/18/2021 6:04 PM] ninuje
We're talking internal one, here


[9/18/2021 6:04 PM] ninuje
Although, IIRC, serial access and/or patched bootloader might allow booting from the external one


[9/18/2021 6:04 PM] ninuje
the TL;DR: being: You still need to open it.


[9/18/2021 6:04 PM] ninuje
And it's not necessarily the easiest at that


[9/18/2021 6:05 PM] ninuje
(waterproofing, IR grid, old panel)


[9/18/2021 6:06 PM] ninuje
And the QPA currently doesn't handle the H2O quite right, because it doesn't handle the screen's viewport (top 11px are hidden behind the bezel)

{Reactions}

[9/18/2021 6:53 PM] the.mightydill
Can confirm (at least for 2nd ed.)


[9/19/2021 2:21 PM] tux_linux
Is there a way to get around it?


[9/19/2021 2:50 PM] ninuje
Probably, the pointer to the start of the buffer just needs to be incremented by 11 scanlines and the height decreased by that much


[9/21/2021 5:22 AM] tux_linux
BTW, I upgraded my Wiki hardware: it's now an Alpine container running in Proxmox. Much faster, but less fun.
Anyways, it deserved it ;p

InkBox OS emulator
This uses the vexpress-a9 ARM board emulated in QEMU. Graphics and input are handled by the libqvnc.so library, which allows one to interact with the UI with a VNC viewer.

Hi greetings Kobo Mini owner here


[1/11/2022 12:30 AM] the.mightydill
hi!


[1/11/2022 12:30 AM] tux_linux
Hullo


[1/11/2022 12:30 AM] daboone72
Just been playing right now. Imaged 1.5 rc1 for Mini but no windows partition to upgrade.


[1/11/2022 12:31 AM] tux_linux
Why the rc1?
Your should take the 1.5 release


[1/11/2022 12:31 AM] tux_linux
http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/n705/inkbox-1.5-n705.xz


[1/11/2022 12:31 AM] tux_linux
rc is for "Release candidate"


[1/11/2022 12:32 AM] daboone72
Actually let me jsut double check that


[1/11/2022 12:33 AM] daboone72
No it is inkbox-1.5-n705 so that's ok actaully


[1/11/2022 12:33 AM] tux_linux
Ok, what problem are you experiencing?


[1/11/2022 12:33 AM] daboone72
Shutdown the Kindle remove the SD card put in Windows it says unrecognised H: partition do you wish to format.


[1/11/2022 12:34 AM] daboone72
With the 1.0 image there was a drive with the .inkbox directory


[1/11/2022 12:34 AM] tux_linux
Flash with balenaEtcher


[1/11/2022 12:34 AM] daboone72

[1/11/2022 12:34 AM] the.mightydill
made a pull request


[1/11/2022 12:34 AM] daboone72
Yes it boots just fine


[1/11/2022 12:35 AM] daboone72
Even runs X fine


[1/11/2022 12:35 AM] daboone72
Can some one md5 sum the image for me?

Looks alright then


[1/11/2022 12:37 AM] tux_linux
but then, what's the problem?
It doesn't work when you connect it via USB?


[1/11/2022 12:37 AM] daboone72
Well ok I'll try with balenaEtcher


[1/11/2022 12:37 AM] daboone72
I can't use the inbox-update-1.8.upd.isa file as there is no partition to copy too


[1/11/2022 12:38 AM] tux_linux
What does it show like?
512MB volume?


[1/11/2022 12:38 AM] tux_linux
Strange, but yeah, click on format, format as FAT, should work


[1/11/2022 12:38 AM] daboone72
8Gb SD card there is a 3.8Gb partition


[1/11/2022 12:38 AM] daboone72
Ahh maybe shitty partition table


[1/11/2022 12:38 AM] tux_linux
You need to update to 1.6 before 1.8


[1/11/2022 12:39 AM] daboone72
1.5 had the auto update feature as I recall


[1/11/2022 12:39 AM] tux_linux
The exported USB storage is just a file, not a partition


[1/11/2022 12:39 AM] tux_linux
It is located in a partition, but it's a raw image file


[1/11/2022 12:41 AM] daboone72
I think I'll delete all the partitions first this time maybe it was a bad write


[1/11/2022 12:42 AM] daboone72
Actually I'm crazy I'll use a decent Sandisk disk


[1/11/2022 12:42 AM] tux_linux
yeah, change your SD


[1/11/2022 12:42 AM] tux_linux
and flash with etcher to be sure


[1/11/2022 12:42 AM] tux_linux
microSD cards don't usually like writes like this that much


[1/11/2022 12:43 AM] daboone72
Raspberry Imager is good actually it does verify nicely and unlike WIn32 Disk imager doesn't have problems with mounted drives


[1/11/2022 12:45 AM] daboone72
I'll keep an open mind I gues maybe balena has more tricks


[1/11/2022 12:45 AM] tux_linux
RPi Imager should be good too


[1/11/2022 12:45 AM] tux_linux
But my only tested imagers were `dd` and Etcher


[1/11/2022 12:47 AM] daboone72
Balena is not impressing option WRite Sandisk on Drive C:\,G:\


[1/11/2022 12:47 AM] daboone72
You are seriously joking


[1/11/2022 12:47 AM] tux_linux

dhd.ko module incompatible with self-compiled kernel · Issue #105 ·...
I&#39;ve recompiled a kernel from the imx507 sources for a Kobo Mini and Kobo Touch. All is fine but the wi-fi module doesn&#39;t want to cope with that kernel. I compiled the other modules...
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/105-4E77D


[1/11/2022 12:54 AM] daboone72
I'd like to have a go after doing some chipset research


[1/11/2022 12:57 AM] daboone72
Is that for  the same chipset as in the Kobo Aura that is working with Wifi


[1/11/2022 12:57 AM] tux_linux
Yes, probably


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] tux_linux
Haven't tested with those, but the Aura is IMX507, not IMX508, which should cause some problems


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] daboone72
https://github-wiki-see.page/m/neuschaefer/linux/wiki/Kobo-Aura


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] tux_linux
(the Mini, Touch C and Glo are IMX507)


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] daboone72
BCM43362


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] daboone72
CyberTan WC121 SDIO wifi chip, well that's the one in my N705.


[1/11/2022 12:58 AM] tux_linux
yep


[1/11/2022 12:59 AM] tux_linux
WiFi was effectively possible with the stock firmware, but was probably done with some obscure help of unknown magic forces ;p


[1/11/2022 12:59 AM] daboone72
I'd hardwire the selection with the kernel config


[1/11/2022 12:59 AM] daboone72
As in build it in


[1/11/2022 1:00 AM] tux_linux
I tried that, wasn't a big success IIRC


[1/11/2022 1:00 AM] tux_linux
I don't want to go through that rabbit hole again 😅


[1/11/2022 1:00 AM] daboone72
That ifconfig: ioctl 0x8914 failed: Operation not permitted there must be some permission layer in the way.


[1/11/2022 1:00 AM] tux_linux
I think it was more related to firmware download


[1/11/2022 1:01 AM] daboone72
Yes the guy saying if the firmwares are there it works


[1/11/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
Because on Touch B (IMX508), it did that first, and then I put a firmware for it in /lib/firmware and it went up without issues


[1/11/2022 1:01 AM] daboone72
That was you odd


[1/11/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
What happened after is that I did the same thing with IMX507 (Touch C, Mini, Glo), but then got problem, even with firmware provided on the stock rootfs


[1/11/2022 1:01 AM] daboone72
eth0 odd interface shouldn't it be wlan0 as well scratches head


[1/11/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
It's just a matter of kernel module code


[1/11/2022 1:02 AM] tux_linux
I guess you could name it `test0` or `kobo0` if you'd want to, too


[1/11/2022 1:03 AM] daboone72
Well I can see you've been giving it a good shot


[1/11/2022 1:03 AM] daboone72
I ws thinking I have an EDIMAX module if can get that micro USB port to recognise stuff


[1/11/2022 1:04 AM] daboone72
That was a dream on the early Raspbery Pi's plug in and it just works

[1/11/2022 1:05 AM] daboone72
Hmm do you mean like that's it's default mode or use case in a wireless hub


[1/11/2022 1:05 AM] tux_linux
No it's not default, I tried it once, it effectively works but you can't set a passphrase


[1/11/2022 1:06 AM] daboone72
It would be great if we could make the last jump the mini's are so cheap on ebay and I half bet people are practically giving them away


[1/11/2022 1:07 AM] daboone72
My goal is to pair it with a DGT chess board and use it as an external large eink display.


[1/11/2022 1:07 AM] daboone72
£25 without battery and £8 for a bettery from Ali express if you can wait.


[1/11/2022 1:07 AM] tux_linux
You can use USBNet though


[1/11/2022 1:07 AM] daboone72
Ahh great that is something


[1/11/2022 1:07 AM] tux_linux
There's a VNC viewer since version 1.6 in InkBox


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] daboone72
Yes I've seen that I'm hoping 1.8 has the xterm built in


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] tux_linux
1.5 has it built in


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] tux_linux
But your device is not rooted


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] tux_linux
So it hides it


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] daboone72
Ahh that's why


[1/11/2022 1:08 AM] tux_linux
You can root it by going in Diagnostics (slide the power button multiple times once the green light starts blinking at boot) and doing "Reset as root"


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] tux_linux
There you'll be able to enable USBNet too


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] daboone72
Ok cool will do that


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] tux_linux
(once your device is rooted, in the "flags" part)


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] daboone72
At least if I can ssh to the thing that would help writing and testing some code


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] tux_linux
Yes you can


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] daboone72
OR I guess telntet probably


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] tux_linux
Built-in SSH server


[1/11/2022 1:09 AM] tux_linux
on 192.168.2.2


[1/11/2022 1:10 AM] tux_linux
So you connect via USB, set your computer's ip to 192.168.2.1 and you ssh to .2


[1/11/2022 1:10 AM] daboone72
So could strap a Rasberry Pi 2W to the back and get internet that way


[1/11/2022 1:10 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, but you can set up a bridge under a Linux PC and get internet access on the Kobo via USB


[1/11/2022 1:10 AM] daboone72
Well just looking for a lightweight stand alone option


[1/11/2022 1:11 AM] tux_linux
Or with the RPi, yes


[1/11/2022 1:11 AM] daboone72
Hmm wonder if could do it with an ESP32 with some code that would be nice


[1/11/2022 1:11 AM] tux_linux
Would probably be more appropriate than a whole computer


[1/11/2022 1:11 AM] daboone72
So that USB socket can be used for normal stuff maybe keyboard/mouse/dongle


[1/11/2022 1:11 AM] tux_linux
And consume less energy too, maybe you could connect it somewhere on the VCC ports of the Kobo


[1/11/2022 1:12 AM] tux_linux
Not out-of-the-box, but if you try hard enough, yes


[1/11/2022 1:12 AM] daboone72
Kernel param maybe to switch modes like a Raspberry Pi can alter it's power direction


[1/11/2022 1:12 AM] daboone72
I have a Pi with a touch screen and a Nextdock seem to recall


[1/11/2022 1:13 AM] daboone72
One of the two had that magic think it was the nextdock


[1/11/2022 1:13 AM] tux_linux
You could also have you RPi broadcasting over USB a VNC screen and connect the keyboard to the RPi, then access the VNC server on the Kobo with InkBox


[1/11/2022 1:13 AM] tux_linux
That's what I did this summer


[1/11/2022 1:15 AM] daboone72
Once it's networked though youc an run Vnc directly on the Kobo yes?


[1/11/2022 1:15 AM] daboone72
Or is just faster on the Pi


[1/11/2022 1:16 AM] daboone72
Well thanks Tux Linux for your efforts so far on the Wifi

What do you mean?


[1/11/2022 1:17 AM] daboone72
I remember looking through the feature list of Inkbox and saw Vnc ahh perhaps that was just a viewer


[1/11/2022 1:17 AM] daboone72
But still there is X on it


[1/11/2022 1:17 AM] tux_linux
Well, you can use x11vnc on it IIRC


[1/11/2022 1:18 AM] tux_linux
But why would you want to?


[1/11/2022 1:18 AM] tux_linux
Actually yes, you absolutely can, since touch input in X is handled by a VNC viewer because I couldn't code a native input driver, so I used a Qt VNC viewer that had touch input working instead


[1/11/2022 1:20 AM] daboone72
I doubt I'd need X anyway mostly the point would be to sftp Python code across and check it still works sanely on the eink display


[1/11/2022 1:20 AM] tux_linux
Though, the VNC server has the `-localhost` option, which means it only serves on 127.0.0.1:5900


[1/11/2022 1:20 AM] tux_linux
But you can start another one


[1/11/2022 1:21 AM] daboone72
Or golang probably but hopefully Kivvy


[1/11/2022 1:21 AM] tux_linux
go isn't on the stock rootfs though


[1/11/2022 1:21 AM] tux_linux
Don't know much about Kivvy, but it's not there either


[1/11/2022 1:21 AM] daboone72
That's ok I've seen it on Alpine Linux though


[1/11/2022 1:21 AM] daboone72
With the right architecture


[1/11/2022 1:22 AM] daboone72
armv7 as I recall

It will be complicated to install
InkBox's rootfs is a squashfs archive mounted read-only, and read-write is kind of difficult to accomplish, it is handled by overlayfs if you really want to, but you can't install packages, just create/modify files


[1/11/2022 1:23 AM] daboone72
Ouch ouch


[1/11/2022 1:23 AM] tux_linux
At worst, you can `apk fetch` the package and untar all of it and deps onto the rootfs, the re-squash it


[1/11/2022 1:23 AM] tux_linux
That's what I do when I need to put a new package in


[1/11/2022 1:24 AM] daboone72
Can we unsquish it more permanently


[1/11/2022 1:24 AM] tux_linux
Nope


[1/11/2022 1:25 AM] daboone72
I wonder why are you trying to sell this to Microsoft later or something and retire to a desert island  😉


[1/11/2022 1:25 AM] tux_linux
Nope, just for security
Also, it writes less to the MMC, prolongs its life


[1/11/2022 1:26 AM] daboone72
I mean don't need compression this day and age with SDs as they are I got 32 Gb the other day for hardly anything


[1/11/2022 1:26 AM] daboone72
Encrypted shouldn't be a show stopper either my work drive is encrypted can still write to it obviously


[1/11/2022 1:26 AM] tux_linux
To give you an idea, here's what `mount` outputs on InkBox OS

You're talking about encrypted storage feature?


[1/11/2022 1:27 AM] daboone72
You might lose out to android or postmarketOs


[1/11/2022 1:27 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, you can add new books to that


[1/11/2022 1:28 AM] daboone72
When I bother to hack something I personally want flexibility to make it more useful


[1/11/2022 1:28 AM] tux_linux
Well, to be fair, most people aren't going to try to get SSH access and play with the rootfs once they flash InkBox


[1/11/2022 1:29 AM] daboone72
You can see I can't write software package it up as a deb or whatever and have it easily deployed


[1/11/2022 1:30 AM] tux_linux
You can make the rootfs almost read-write, fuse-overlayfs does well its job if you really want to, the only problem is a missing `rename2` syscall that makes **moving** files impossible. Copy and remove is possible. The kernel on those devices is way too old (2.6.35.3)


[1/11/2022 1:30 AM] tux_linux
On testing models like Libra, rootfs can be completely r/w because the syscall is there


[1/11/2022 1:32 AM] daboone72
Ok will have todo some research see if Alpine's package manager unpacks and moves things


[1/11/2022 1:32 AM] tux_linux
Yes it does, unfortunately


[1/11/2022 1:33 AM] tux_linux
But I guess you could untar the packages there and it would work


[1/11/2022 1:33 AM] daboone72
I wonder what about a /usr/local and force install there


[1/11/2022 1:34 AM] tux_linux
Elsewise, you can make yourself a tiny Alpine r/w chroot in a disk image in mmcblk0p4 and install things there


[1/11/2022 1:34 AM] tux_linux
What do you mean?


[1/11/2022 1:34 AM] daboone72
Well partition the SD card with another lInux partition modify fstab once to mount that read/write


[1/11/2022 1:34 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, you probably could


[1/11/2022 1:35 AM] daboone72
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib /usr/local/etc


[1/11/2022 1:35 AM] tux_linux
You'd have to create disk images for them, but it would work


[1/11/2022 1:35 AM] daboone72
This is for user software not kernelly type stuff


[1/11/2022 1:37 AM] daboone72
Well think I'll have to look at building Inkbox from the source to get some flexibility


[1/11/2022 1:38 AM] tux_linux

Though, you need a kernel with your own public key to make the device boot

Because the rootfs needs to be signed

Ahh goodly wonder if that would work for a Clara Hd too


[1/11/2022 1:29 PM] tux_linux
Yep, once it gets ported


[1/11/2022 4:42 PM] daboone72
Of course ideally I'd like it on the Kobo Mini but if can get a good development environment will look at getting a Clara as I know wifi works on it


[1/11/2022 4:43 PM] tux_linux
If you want to repackage the rootfs and make changes to the InkBox filesystem/kernel in general, you better use a developer key, or you'll have to re-sign all the packages of the OS, which is... long.
The developer key alleviates this problem by requiring you to only sign rootfs-related packages


[1/11/2022 4:43 PM] tux_linux
You can get a Touch N905B, Wi-Fi works on it


[1/11/2022 4:43 PM] tux_linux
(with InkBox)


[1/11/2022 4:44 PM] tux_linux
Not as fast as the Clara, but it's good nevertheless

For the developer key, I can help you, I'll tell you the steps


[1/11/2022 10:48 PM] daboone72
Others here I remember tux saying to go from 1.5 to 1.8 I have to upgrade to 1.6 first do you then have to upgrade to 1.6.2 and then 1.7?


[1/11/2022 10:49 PM] tux_linux
1.6, you put the two update files at once
Then I think you can jump to 1.8 without issues, without updating to 1.7 first


[1/11/2022 10:50 PM] daboone72

[1/11/2022 10:57 PM] tux_linux
No


[1/11/2022 10:57 PM] tux_linux
It's pretty upgrade-agnostic


[1/11/2022 10:58 PM] daboone72
So it will survive in short


[1/11/2022 10:58 PM] tux_linux
The whole system pretty much works with packages, even the rootfs, which makes upgrades a lot more easier and failproof : https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/update.sh

[1/11/2022 10:58 PM] tux_linux
Yeah


[1/11/2022 10:58 PM] daboone72
As I can imagine it's probably not that well tested in 1.8 but 1.6


[1/11/2022 10:59 PM] tux_linux
No
Though, if you want to root and stay at 1.8, there's a special procedure for that


[1/11/2022 10:59 PM] daboone72
Ok that is one very good benefit of the architecture


[1/11/2022 10:59 PM] tux_linux
Because normally the reset as root reinstalls the whole system, reverting back to 1.5


[1/11/2022 11:00 PM] daboone72
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify /opt/key/public.pem -signature "${U_BOOT_DGST}" "${U_BOOT}" Guess the dev key is a sha256 pem then


[1/11/2022 11:00 PM] tux_linux
Yeah


[1/11/2022 11:00 PM] tux_linux
Everything's verified like that

It finished updating?


[1/11/2022 11:03 PM] daboone72
Yes to 1.6 I guess reset and allow root access then USB net appears in the menus


[1/11/2022 11:03 PM] tux_linux
Wait a sec


[1/11/2022 11:03 PM] daboone72
As I can't see it in any of the other menus on 1.6 anyway


[1/11/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux

[1/11/2022 11:04 PM] daboone72
Yes


[1/11/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux
Or something with the `dd` command

Yes IBM M900 running Linux love it


[1/11/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux

[1/11/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux

I'm already in the diagnostic menu so will root i tnow


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
You sure you want to do a complete reset?


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
Will take 15+ mins


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] daboone72
It's fine it's brand new there's no books or data on there


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
And you'll have to upgrade to 1.6 again


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
If you want
Though, it uncompresses ~3G of data onto the MMC, not sure if you want that to happen


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] daboone72
Ohh it rolls back a version


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/11/2022 11:05 PM] tux_linux
It's like, a \*complete\* reset


[1/11/2022 11:06 PM] daboone72
Ahh ic that's a pity


[1/11/2022 11:06 PM] daboone72
Ok I don't know how to answer the onboard storage size value anyway


[1/11/2022 11:07 PM] tux_linux
So basically root verification works like that: if user flashes a ROOT kernel without having the root flag in the MMC, it reflashes back the STD (standard) kernel

Only 1.6 not 1.6.2


[1/11/2022 11:09 PM] daboone72
I reimaged directly to 1.5 and then just applied the 1.6 upgrade


[1/11/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
There never was any 1.6.2


[1/11/2022 11:09 PM] daboone72
There is in the downloads section


[1/11/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux

http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/1.6/n705/


[1/11/2022 11:10 PM] tux_linux
well it's `1.6-2`, not `1.6.2`
I meant that as "the second part of the 1.6 upgrade"


[1/11/2022 11:10 PM] daboone72
Quite tiny though inkbox-update-1.6-2.upd_stg.isa


[1/11/2022 11:10 PM] tux_linux
It's because of a silly error by me


[1/11/2022 11:10 PM] daboone72
Ohh should I do that one as well


[1/11/2022 11:11 PM] daboone72
I may as well go to 1.8 then do this rooting


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
At that time, 1.5 images were almost perfect but I realized the update.sh didn't copy the digest file for the rootfs for verification at boot, so booting after updating the rootfs would always fail
So the 1.6 update bind-mounted `update.sh` which had the `cp` command which copied the digest to allow it to boot. Then, the 1.6_stg real update installed a clean kernel without bind-mounting and working rootfs


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] daboone72
Ohh curious it's updating again I guess that's why


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
Did you copy one or two files?


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] daboone72
Just the one so I need to copy both?


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
If you copied the two it should work


[1/11/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/11/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
as stated in http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/1.6/HOWTO-Update


[1/11/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
Maybe it's just better if you reset as root


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
Otherwise you might have problems debricking it (if it can't finish updating and gets stuck there)


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] daboone72
We're thjere anyway


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
Oh it works?


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] daboone72
It does boot eventually even without the second patch


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
So ok, now copy the 1.6-2 one


[1/11/2022 11:14 PM] tux_linux
It should hopefully work


[1/11/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
Because it's still actually at 1.5


[1/11/2022 11:15 PM] daboone72
If I copy both will it do any harm?


[1/11/2022 11:15 PM] daboone72
Ther's only the can_update and can_really_update files in .inkbox now


[1/11/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
Normal, after an update the update files are erased


[1/11/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
So copy the 1.6-2 and it should be fine


[1/11/2022 11:16 PM] daboone72
Ok


[1/11/2022 11:16 PM] daboone72
Was the echo "rooted" | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=79872 all I need to root after that?


[1/11/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
No, you also need to flash the rooted uImage


[1/11/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
But it's about it


[1/11/2022 11:17 PM] daboone72
Rooted uimage where do I get that?


[1/11/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
`dd if=uImage-root-n705 of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=81920`

[1/11/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
That's the one for 1.8 release, so you're better off upgrading to 1.8 first then rooting the device


[1/11/2022 11:18 PM] daboone72
Ok gotcha


[1/11/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
It's in the update packages, which you can mount, they're squashfs images

I guess you do it via loopback it's been quite a while


[1/11/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it's basically a mountable tar archive


[1/11/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Quite useful


[1/11/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
The rootfs is also a mounted squashfs


[1/11/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
That's why it's difficult to make it read-write without overlayfs


[1/11/2022 11:20 PM] daboone72
Not used squashfs but I guess a compressed partition


[1/11/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
Kind of


[1/11/2022 11:21 PM] daboone72
gzip special I guess


[1/11/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
Saves space


[1/11/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
I personally use XZ compression


[1/11/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
Even more space saved
(at cost of hardware resources, yes, but I made a choice...)


[1/11/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
Actually `seek=` is `81920`, not `2048`, I modified it


[1/11/2022 11:22 PM] daboone72
Good choice CPUs fast disk is still slow


[1/11/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
It gets better with newer devices like Libra


[1/11/2022 11:22 PM] daboone72
Ok


[1/11/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux

Screen is not that nice though


[1/11/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
227 ppi


[1/11/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
Clara HD has 300 PPI


[1/11/2022 11:24 PM] daboone72
Ahh there's a Kobo Sage too wonder if that has an SD card inside


[1/11/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
Yes, I think


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] tux_linux
Strangely


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] tux_linux
It's tropicalized, so difficult to remove, but yes


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] daboone72
I liked the forma but apparently it has hard wired memory


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] tux_linux
yep, and Libra H2O too


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] tux_linux
But there has been discovered you can get an empty Libra to put itself in download mode if nothing is on the eMMC, so that's very useful


[1/11/2022 11:25 PM] daboone72
Ahh drat waterproof would have been handy for the beach


[1/11/2022 11:26 PM] daboone72
Ahh that's not so bad if it becomes like a recognisable disk on the USB


[1/11/2022 11:26 PM] daboone72
Yay upgraded to 1.6 now 1.8


[1/11/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
You have to use a special tool (`uuu`) that can load U-Boot in RAM from USB, then you use U-Boot for rescuing the rest of the device


[1/11/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
Nice


[1/11/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
It \*should\* jump without any issues, although I haven't tested that in particular, but as you saw the update script is quite adapted for that


[1/11/2022 11:27 PM] daboone72
I was thinking before maybe of a developer image with useful build tools


[1/11/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
Maybe, yes


[1/11/2022 11:28 PM] daboone72
Well even the 16gigabyte cards there seems to be lots of space to play with


[1/11/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
The emulator would be quite a good candidate for that


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] daboone72
Yes definitely a more pleasurable dev environment


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] tux_linux
But there's a 4 partition limit on the MBR layout


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] tux_linux
And InkBox is configured that way, so you'd have to make an extended partition or use a disk image on user storage partition (not the same as exported storage)


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] daboone72
Primarys but extended


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/11/2022 11:29 PM] daboone72
Or growfs even


[1/11/2022 11:30 PM] daboone72
Ohh my can-update files are gone


[1/11/2022 11:30 PM] tux_linux
That looks normal


[1/11/2022 11:30 PM] tux_linux
It deletes them too


[1/11/2022 11:30 PM] daboone72
Ok grand


[1/11/2022 11:31 PM] daboone72
To sell my DGT friends into getting a Kobo Clara say, they would need convincing they still have a useful ereader after hacking it so this distro is a great choice


[1/11/2022 11:32 PM] daboone72
They are hardware modders prepared to pop cases and swap Rsapberry Pi's over. So probably would like development option too.


[1/11/2022 11:33 PM] daboone72
But happily comfortable with imaging a distro to an SD card and debugging so not a great leap


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] daboone72
Which Kobo are you thinking of getting the Libra H2O?


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] tux_linux
I already have it


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] tux_linux
I ported InkBox OS to it, too


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] daboone72
Ohh happy days 🙂


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] tux_linux
It's just not widely available due to the device having eMMC


[1/11/2022 11:34 PM] tux_linux
But the kernel sources are there, support in the OS is there too


[1/11/2022 11:35 PM] tux_linux
Device ID is N873, maybe you've seen it somewhere in the scripts


[1/11/2022 11:35 PM] daboone72
There's the Libra 2 not bothered about  audio books but comfort light sounds quite nice


[1/11/2022 11:35 PM] daboone72
I like the landscape mode it's nice for building apps


[1/11/2022 11:37 PM] daboone72
8Gb to 32Gigabyte that's quite a jump


[1/11/2022 11:37 PM] tux_linux
InkBox fits on a 4GB one


[1/11/2022 11:38 PM] tux_linux

[1/11/2022 11:39 PM] tux_linux
Nice!


[1/11/2022 11:40 PM] daboone72
It has a very tiny eink display on it. My idea have an external eink reader with a much larger display


[1/11/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
And what would it display?


[1/11/2022 11:40 PM] daboone72
I can push the chess board status to the reader and display the board , move history other stats much larger


[1/11/2022 11:40 PM] daboone72
If the refresh is good too display chess clocks with 1 second refresh


[1/11/2022 11:41 PM] tux_linux
Qt would be nice for that


[1/11/2022 11:41 PM] tux_linux
Yes, refresh rate is fine


[1/11/2022 11:41 PM] tux_linux
There's a 'show seconds' option on the clock in InkBox IIRC


[1/11/2022 11:41 PM] daboone72
Yes well touch friendly interface is good too.


[1/11/2022 11:41 PM] daboone72
Python and Kivvy would be nice the board custom mod is in Python and would then port to other devices easily

[1/11/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
Oh it works


[1/11/2022 11:43 PM] tux_linux
There's a static Python binary in the GUI chroot


[1/11/2022 11:43 PM] daboone72
Want to experiment run some gui tests in a virtual machine


[1/11/2022 11:43 PM] daboone72
Try all the widgets out etc. If not probably golang and Qt which does threading rather nicely.

Really?


[1/11/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
I find Qt with C++ pretty nice


[1/11/2022 11:44 PM] daboone72
Well perhaps a little to at least experience the out << "Hello world!" fun and games


[1/11/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux
It's kind of similar to Python in some ways


[1/11/2022 11:45 PM] daboone72
Though I half expected Gimp to be in C++ but it's in C wth GTK of course


[1/11/2022 11:45 PM] daboone72
I like KDE though and thought Qt was nice


[1/11/2022 11:46 PM] tux_linux
Oh that's surprising; I knew GIMP was GTK but not C


[1/11/2022 11:46 PM] tux_linux

Why it's better not to use Alpine Linux for python projects - Seb's...
Alpine Linux has become quite popular as Docker base image due to its size. However, instead of the common glibc it uses muslc which could impact you dependi...


[1/11/2022 11:47 PM] tux_linux
Well, first you can compile a static binary
Second, if you're not happy with Alpine you can set up yourself a Debian chroot


[1/11/2022 11:47 PM] daboone72
Ohh heavy I got the secruity warning


[1/11/2022 11:47 PM] daboone72
"The security policy was violated. ! " etc


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
The Kobo Mini only supports up to Debian 8 though due to glibc/kernel limitations


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
Oh


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
You tried to update to 1.8?


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] daboone72
Yes


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] daboone72
Yes I just tried to update to 1.8


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
You can still access the GUI?


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] daboone72
If I reset I'll go back I guess to 1.5


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] daboone72
I'll continue


[1/11/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
No, there's hope


[1/11/2022 11:49 PM] daboone72
Ok holding


[1/11/2022 11:49 PM] tux_linux
If you go in Settings, go to page 2, is there an "Encrypted storage" option of any kind?


[1/11/2022 11:49 PM] daboone72
So I should click continue anyuway?


[1/11/2022 11:49 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/11/2022 11:50 PM] daboone72
Update complete


[1/11/2022 11:50 PM] tux_linux
Yeah... it partially updated


[1/11/2022 11:50 PM] daboone72
No encyrpted that I can see in the Inkbox settings


[1/11/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
Somehow a verification failed somewhere


[1/11/2022 11:51 PM] daboone72
Storage : Enable USB mass storage session only on second page


[1/11/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
Anyway, try with 1.7 update package, then 1.8
That should work


[1/11/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
So nothing like this?

Ok 1..7 it is pity


[1/11/2022 11:53 PM] tux_linux
yeah, I don't know what failed


[1/11/2022 11:53 PM] daboone72
But now e know go 1.7 then 1.8


[1/11/2022 11:53 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/11/2022 11:53 PM] tux_linux
If that doesn't work, then something's seriously wrong with your Kobo


[1/11/2022 11:55 PM] daboone72
Well it could be because I did partial 1.6 too


[1/11/2022 11:55 PM] daboone72
But we'll try this see if it repairs it


[1/11/2022 11:55 PM] daboone72
I wondered whether to reboot again


[1/11/2022 11:58 PM] tux_linux
Maybe


[1/12/2022 12:00 AM] daboone72
Ahh it didn't recognise the update file rebooting anyway


[1/12/2022 12:01 AM] daboone72
It does think it's on 1.8 though maybe encrypted will appear on reboot


[1/12/2022 12:01 AM] daboone72
I like qemu dev environment with the VNC trick looks very nice

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/12/2022 12:02 AM] tux_linux
At this point, maybe it's better if you just reset


[1/12/2022 12:02 AM] tux_linux
Then, 1.6 with two files, 1.7 then 1.8


[1/12/2022 12:02 AM] daboone72
Yes and it's till moaning about violation so


[1/12/2022 12:03 AM] daboone72
Yes I agree well worth a shot anyway


[1/12/2022 12:03 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, wipe the device


[1/12/2022 12:04 AM] daboone72
Well it's 11pm uk time so think will call it a night getting closer though.


[1/12/2022 12:04 AM] tux_linux
Ok, good night!


[1/13/2022 12:04 AM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Just FYI redid the process tonight 1.5-> 1.6 both files this time -> 1.7 -> 1.8 and still got security violation at 1.8. No encrypted menu option at 1.7 or 1.8 and the file browser has no easy way to close. Have to reboot to get out of it.


[1/13/2022 3:22 AM] tux_linux
Welp, nice.
I'll try on my Mini, might be a signing error somewhere


[1/13/2022 3:23 AM] tux_linux
If it stayed at 1.7 and you can access it it's good
I'll see what happens with the update package and get back to you tomorrow or later tonight


[1/13/2022 3:24 AM] tux_linux
It's nice you encountered the problem, it shows how tiny my userbase is 🥴


[1/13/2022 12:24 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  I will try again as well what I noticed is the can-upgrade files dissapeared after 1.7 I think that might be a pointer


[1/13/2022 12:24 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Next try 1.5 -> 1.6 both files -> straight to 1.8


[1/13/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
No, found the problem


[1/13/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Due to some passwd file crazy bug in standard kernels
Can reproduce here


[1/13/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Will try to fix


[1/13/2022 5:13 PM] tux_linux
Though, I can assure you, your 1.8 update worked. All signing has been done correctly, and kernel flashed as expected


[1/13/2022 5:13 PM] daboone72
That's good to here

[1/13/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
So basically, it will show the warning at every boot but you can ignore it


[1/13/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
If you root the device warning will likely disappear


[1/13/2022 5:14 PM] daboone72
Hmm but I could see no extra options in the menu inkbox


[1/13/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
In settings?


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
I can see encryption settings here


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
I did a full SD flash from 1.5 factory and tried updating as you did on your Mini


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] daboone72
Yes that screenshot you showed


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
Did you go to the second page?


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
The little right arrow


[1/13/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
At the top


[1/13/2022 5:16 PM] daboone72
Ohh at the top


[1/13/2022 5:17 PM] daboone72
Yes now I see it


[1/13/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
So yeah, it should be fine


[1/13/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
Do this


[1/13/2022 5:17 PM] daboone72
Storage encryption marked as disabled


[1/13/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
Before that, do `echo rooted | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=79872`


[1/13/2022 5:18 PM] tux_linux
Normal, you can enable it if you want


[1/13/2022 5:19 PM] daboone72
Ok great don't need to reimage.


[1/13/2022 5:19 PM] daboone72
Give us a little while was going to sort out authorized keys to my Linux box as remembering password ws driving me crazy


[1/13/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
yeah sure


[1/13/2022 5:20 PM] daboone72
Btw have been researching the Libra 2 trying to see if it's mostly the same as the Libra H2O


[1/13/2022 5:21 PM] daboone72
As £10 extra for Bluetooth and 32Gb and better screen would be nice


[1/13/2022 5:21 PM] tux_linux
I think it's still i.MX-based, not Allwinner so it should be relatively easy to port


[1/13/2022 5:22 PM] daboone72
If I can find the right forum will ask. Though stupidly there was a discussion about removing SD cards I forgot to save


[1/13/2022 5:22 PM] tux_linux
I'm just kinda freaking out now as I'm wondering if this bug affects all other devices too


[1/13/2022 5:22 PM] tux_linux
mobileread usually is fairly good for dev discussions


[1/13/2022 5:23 PM] daboone72
You'd have probably had more bug reports


[1/13/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
You can also try the mobileread discord


[1/13/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
But how many users do I have? ;p


[1/13/2022 5:23 PM] daboone72
Your admin here you could create a quick poll


[1/13/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
Yeah maybe


[1/13/2022 5:25 PM] daboone72
I think you just need some kind of killer app for it.


[1/13/2022 5:26 PM] tux_linux
What do you mean?


[1/13/2022 5:27 PM] daboone72
Well something that really will motivate people to switch. A unique feature exploiting the display


[1/13/2022 5:27 PM] tux_linux
You know, I think that with encrypted storage, I pretty much hit the pinnacle of features


[1/13/2022 5:28 PM] daboone72
Could port all text based adventure games to it.

[1/13/2022 5:35 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, use /dev/sdb instead then


[1/13/2022 5:36 PM] daboone72
I thought so what kernel is using the /dev/mmc style


[1/13/2022 5:36 PM] daboone72
Or are you thinking raspberry pi


[1/13/2022 5:37 PM] tux_linux
Well, it would be if you had an integrated SD reader


[1/13/2022 5:37 PM] tux_linux
e.g. on my laptop


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] daboone72
ahh


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] daboone72
Ok that's the root one done now I need that image as i recall


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] daboone72
dd if=uImage-root-n705 of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=81920


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
Ok, oof, that's a big bug, but I know what to do
Let's re-make all 1.8 updates :yay: !


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[1/13/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
and replace mmcblk0 with sdb


[1/13/2022 5:39 PM] daboone72
Yes figures 🙂


[1/13/2022 5:42 PM] daboone72
Ok was that it?


[1/13/2022 5:42 PM] daboone72
root@daniels-m900:/home/daniel# dd if=uImage-root-n705 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=81920

[1/13/2022 5:42 PM] tux_linux
yep


[1/13/2022 5:42 PM] tux_linux
Don't forget the `echo rooted` part


[1/13/2022 5:42 PM] daboone72
I did that first


[1/13/2022 5:43 PM] tux_linux
Well `sync` and then you can put it back in the Mini


[1/13/2022 5:43 PM] daboone72
Smallest ever dd


[1/13/2022 5:43 PM] daboone72
Well dd not mounted so should be fine


[1/13/2022 5:43 PM] tux_linux
Hehe


[1/13/2022 5:46 PM] daboone72
So slow booting could do with a progress bar. Though maybe it;s lightening on the Clara and later mdoels


[1/13/2022 5:46 PM] tux_linux
Yeah I agree


[1/13/2022 5:46 PM] tux_linux
Maybe up for a next release


[1/13/2022 5:47 PM] tux_linux
A bit like how Kindles boot?


[1/13/2022 5:47 PM] daboone72
I think maybe Suse distro had a nice kernel progress bar


[1/13/2022 5:48 PM] daboone72
Yay have USB rooting and DHCP lease menu options


[1/13/2022 5:48 PM] tux_linux
You can go in Diagnostics and enable USBNet in the Flags menu


[1/13/2022 5:48 PM] daboone72
And Kterm too


[1/13/2022 5:49 PM] tux_linux
Then reboot on main system and it should work with 192.168.2.2 over USB


[1/13/2022 5:50 PM] daboone72
Ahh yes will do the slide the power switch on flashing disk.


[1/13/2022 5:50 PM] daboone72
How many times is enough btw?


[1/13/2022 5:50 PM] tux_linux
One


[1/13/2022 5:51 PM] tux_linux
Though, you better do it more because sometimes you do it a little too early, a little too late or whatever


[1/13/2022 5:52 PM] daboone72
Down to three anyway I think once it starts flashing after that brief blue pause.


[1/13/2022 5:53 PM] tux_linux
When it starts flashing, it means U-Boot has started the kernel successfully


[1/13/2022 5:53 PM] tux_linux
When it's blue, it means U-Boot is loading the kernel


[1/13/2022 5:53 PM] tux_linux
When it's not flashing but green, it means U-Boot has started


[1/13/2022 5:54 PM] daboone72

[1/13/2022 5:54 PM] daboone72
There you go Tux is happy


[1/13/2022 5:55 PM] daboone72
I got my Tux  ages ago at a conference at Earls Court in London must have been 2000


[1/13/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
Wow that's awesome


[1/13/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
So you've really been following from the beginning


[1/13/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
I wasn't even born in 2000 ;p


[1/13/2022 5:57 PM] daboone72
Even before that I as a Slackware guy and Redhat 3.0


[1/13/2022 5:57 PM] daboone72
First Linux on floppy disc manual X config hard work


[1/13/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
I'm on Gentoo right now


[1/13/2022 5:57 PM] daboone72
That's hard core


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, once you get to know it it's versatile


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] daboone72
Hopefully last question for USB net should I accept computer connection when plugigng in?


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
I guess?


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
You could connect it on Linux elsewise


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
`ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1`
`ssh user@192.168.2.2`


[1/13/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
Password is `user`
you can do `su` and password is `root`


[1/13/2022 5:59 PM] daboone72
Ok that's the way it's designed will do that


[1/13/2022 5:59 PM] tux_linux
I tested it on Mac too, worked
Don't know about Windows really


[1/13/2022 6:01 PM] daboone72

And am in


[1/13/2022 6:04 PM] tux_linux
Nice !


[1/13/2022 6:04 PM] tux_linux
Did it show any warning at boot? Or gone like expected?

You can use triple backticks to make code blocks


[1/13/2022 6:04 PM] tux_linux
But yeah

[1/13/2022 6:05 PM] daboone72
Sweet


[1/13/2022 6:05 PM] daboone72
I guess no harm in trying the read/write line


[1/13/2022 6:06 PM] tux_linux
You could, but it can make your rootfs "dirty" as I call it


[1/13/2022 6:07 PM] tux_linux
To reset the changes you made and revert to clean commit you can
`mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt`
`rm -rf /mnt/rootfs`
Will remove fuse-overlayfs cache


[1/13/2022 6:08 PM] daboone72
Ah yes will take an image of my card anyway to get back to where I was.


[1/13/2022 6:08 PM] tux_linux
That's a good idea, yep


[1/13/2022 6:10 PM] daboone72
Well we've covered some ground I'll try and write this up

Yeah, it's a big mangle of bind-mounts, symlinks and things


[1/13/2022 6:15 PM] daboone72
I was thinking you see is 8gigabytes enough storage, will do the sizing of my ebooks and more importantly PDFs


[1/13/2022 6:15 PM] tux_linux
Pretty complicated
But yeah, about 564M available in /data/storage (mmcblk0p4)


[1/13/2022 6:17 PM] daboone72
Mine is a 16gigabyte SD card so presumambly there's a way to use all ofit


[1/13/2022 6:17 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, you'd need to resize the 4th partition


[1/13/2022 6:17 PM] tux_linux
And size up the `onboard` file in `/data/storage/onboard`


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] daboone72
I think I'm going to go Koitlin on the development


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] tux_linux
You'll have to install Java I guess


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] daboone72
Koitlin and then I'll rewrite the thing in Clojure


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] tux_linux
Are you joking


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] daboone72
Openjdk


[1/13/2022 6:21 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] daboone72
No I'm trying to learn Clojure so it'll be a good exercise


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] tux_linux
Ah, nice


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] daboone72
This is for my Chess App


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] tux_linux
Oh, it compiles to Java


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] daboone72
Clojure is actually Java byte code


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] tux_linux
nice


[1/13/2022 6:22 PM] daboone72
Yes rather nice can use any Java library too


[1/13/2022 6:23 PM] daboone72
The next fun thing will be your qemu environment

The serial setup? It works, but it's janky


[1/13/2022 6:25 PM] tux_linux
The board is a Lichee Pi Zero


[1/13/2022 6:26 PM] tux_linux
The other one is a Banana Pi M2 Zero I'm trying to use to develop an InkBox reader


[1/13/2022 6:26 PM] tux_linux
Like, that could actually sell at some point


[1/13/2022 6:27 PM] tux_linux
The wires are from repurposed Ethernet cables


[1/13/2022 6:27 PM] daboone72
Lichee Pi Zero must look that one up


[1/13/2022 6:28 PM] tux_linux
It's a very nice board

That's just insane it supports 1080p H2.264 Lovely


[1/13/2022 6:46 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, but at 32MB, it won't do very much


[1/13/2022 6:46 PM] tux_linux
And documentation is scarce


[1/13/2022 6:46 PM] daboone72
LCD interface wonder if can drive an eink too


[1/13/2022 6:46 PM] tux_linux

Are you sure you want to throw 2.15Gb of writes into the SD card?


[1/13/2022 7:05 PM] daboone72
No most of those will be A4 anyway too big really for a small reader.


[1/13/2022 7:05 PM] daboone72
But O'Reilly books and Manning books are probably alright and other java text books


[1/13/2022 7:05 PM] tux_linux
You can remove the onboard file then
`dd if=/dev/zero of=onboard bs=1M count=2048`
`mkfs.vfat onboard`


[1/13/2022 7:06 PM] tux_linux
(assuming you want a 2G file)


[1/13/2022 7:06 PM] tux_linux
otherwise 4096 for 4G etc.


[1/13/2022 7:06 PM] tux_linux
oh, and `sync`


[1/13/2022 7:08 PM] daboone72
I guess you have to unmount the onboard first

If it complains being busy, add the `-l -f` flags

After the dd sync as you say then I guess  reboot to return to normal


[1/13/2022 7:10 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, or you could do `rc-service inkbox_gui restart` but it's better to reboot

At least it's not soldered to the motherboard nasty business.

You sure you'll succeed with a 2.6.35.3 shitty old kernel?


[1/13/2022 9:46 PM] daboone72
Well might have to rebuild  from source but hopefully


[1/13/2022 9:46 PM] tux_linux
IIRC, I tried that and a lot of features needed by Anbox weren't there in 2.6.x kernels


[1/13/2022 9:47 PM] daboone72
Alright maybe it's time to get to 5.x


[1/13/2022 9:47 PM] tux_linux

yes


[1/13/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
Now it's not really Alpine Linux anymore ;p


[1/13/2022 9:51 PM] tux_linux
Also, Alpine on the Mini can go up to 3.10, not further, because kernel issues


[1/13/2022 9:51 PM] daboone72
Well that's not such a great move, was there some fundamental blocker


[1/13/2022 9:52 PM] tux_linux
What do you mean?


[1/13/2022 9:52 PM] daboone72
Ohhh I'm going to go to Kobo Libra H2O or Libra 2


[1/13/2022 9:52 PM] tux_linux
I meant that I modified the rootfs so much that it's not really Alpine Linux anymore, more like InkBox OS


[1/13/2022 9:52 PM] daboone72
Alpine for Inkbox is like Android to Normal Linux I guess


[1/13/2022 9:53 PM] tux_linux
not really


[1/13/2022 9:53 PM] daboone72
Well they are no longer compatible


[1/13/2022 9:53 PM] daboone72
apt-get upgrade Alpine will break Inkbox


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
Yes, you can install packages, do alpine-related stuff, but in general init scripts, internal binaries, have been modified


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
Possible, haven't tried... ;p


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] daboone72
Pity I'd have left it as an App running on Alpine and then deal with the security


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
It's mode like `apk upgrade`


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] daboone72
Yes I couldn't remember command 🙂


[1/13/2022 9:54 PM] tux_linux
It was basically that at the beginning


[1/13/2022 9:55 PM] tux_linux
Though then I needed a kernel with initrd to handle dual-boot with diagnostics, ensure package signing was verified, etc.

[1/13/2022 10:09 PM] tux_linux
Well, I'm sure it is possible to port 5.15 to Kobo Mini, however you'll need to create all the drivers, especially the EPDC (display) one, as well as making a DeviceTree to boot the platform


[1/13/2022 10:10 PM] tux_linux
Andreas Kemnade has ported mainline to Libra H2O


[1/13/2022 10:10 PM] tux_linux
(except for display)


[1/13/2022 10:11 PM] daboone72
Well I am happy to *get* the Libra H2O but would have been nice to do good stuff with the Mini.


[1/13/2022 10:12 PM] daboone72
I guess you will still be on the same Alpine for Libra H2O at least for a while.


[1/13/2022 10:13 PM] daboone72
Yes I see September last year https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210918141627.2142457-4-andreas@kemnade.info/


[1/13/2022 10:14 PM] daboone72
Ok I think that does it will get a Libra H2O if the kernel is ready at least it's just a question of time for the display driver


[1/13/2022 10:15 PM] daboone72
And what's the point of porting the drivers without a display he may even have the patch almost ready to go


[1/13/2022 10:16 PM] daboone72
Inkbox works on the Libra H2O already right? So the code must exist


[1/13/2022 10:19 PM] tux_linux
It already has 4.1.15, so it's better


[1/13/2022 10:19 PM] tux_linux
It's the hardest part


[1/13/2022 10:25 PM] daboone72
I guess I can't comment really kernel maintenance not being my bag.


[1/13/2022 10:25 PM] tux_linux
One word: tough


[1/13/2022 10:30 PM] daboone72
Well no Android support under Inkbox then. Well guess will have to abandon that idea of a portable useful app.


[1/13/2022 10:31 PM] tux_linux
Maybe on newer devices


[1/13/2022 10:31 PM] tux_linux
But I doubt it would work on the Mini


[1/13/2022 10:32 PM] daboone72
Well Mini is too crippled for my main project. I may use it for something else that doesn't require a network.


[1/13/2022 10:32 PM] daboone72

The Touch B might be a better choice for a lower cost


[1/13/2022 10:34 PM] daboone72
I am happy with Libra H2O it won't be long before they are used and that might well coincide when the DGT Mod has a very stable code base.


[1/13/2022 10:34 PM] daboone72
Plus being the sort of second generation now quite likely to be 20% off in a summer kind of sale.


[1/13/2022 10:35 PM] tux_linux
Yeah probably


[1/13/2022 10:35 PM] daboone72
20% off makes it £125 and it's a nice upgrade from a Kindle and great resolution. Plus looks nice in landscape mode

@everyone What would be a killer feature to implement for InkBox 2.0?
FYI, 1.9 is on the verge of release and will bring online library support for Wi-Fi-compatible devices, UI redesign and picture display support.


[1/14/2022 6:49 AM] db.qp.db
multi-tasking apps? 😉


[1/14/2022 6:50 AM] tux_linux
In X11?


[1/14/2022 6:50 AM] tux_linux
Or Qt


[1/14/2022 6:50 AM] db.qp.db
oh, good point - you already support x11


[1/14/2022 6:50 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, it runs i3, so quite a lot of flexibility


[1/14/2022 6:51 AM] db.qp.db
people are talking about getting x11 on rM working (well: they technically keep talking about wayland), but doesn't it have slow refresh?


[1/14/2022 6:52 AM] db.qp.db
i still haven't flashed inkbox, but i just finished the merge of kobo support to rmkit, so i'm ready to try it out for when i have a spare weekend

[1/14/2022 6:53 AM] tux_linux
Input is handled by a blind Qt VNC client connected to x11vnc
(Yes, it's that dumb ;p)


[1/14/2022 6:53 AM] tux_linux
What device will you try it on?


[1/14/2022 6:53 AM] db.qp.db
libra h20


[1/14/2022 6:53 AM] tux_linux
Ok, so that's quite the task


[1/14/2022 6:54 AM] tux_linux
I'll guide you for the manual setup


[1/14/2022 6:54 AM] tux_linux
Involves repartitioning the eMMC to dual-boot Nickel and InkBox


[1/14/2022 6:55 AM] tux_linux
Even if we brick the device, there should be a chance of recovery via USB download mode


[1/14/2022 6:57 AM] tux_linux
If your want to play safe, you can try it out in the emulator first
Pretty much everything works


[1/14/2022 7:21 AM] db.qp.db
yeah, emulator sounds good


[1/14/2022 7:22 AM] db.qp.db
someone was telling me about a way to run a server for the kobo to browse (instead of their server), it was like osdf or ospdf or something

Interesting propositions, interesting considerations.
I'm not that sure about PostScript, maybe there's a native Qt thing that could print it
But thanks for the suggestions!

Could make a nice KoBox add-on

golang is used for alot of miroservices and that's been part of my work life and also DevOps.


[1/14/2022 2:47 PM] tux_linux
Then you can include golang in the KoBox package


[1/14/2022 2:48 PM] tux_linux
KoBox packages are like a part of the rootfs


[1/14/2022 2:48 PM] daboone72

[1/14/2022 2:51 PM] daboone72
2500 hours on this one how on earth did you stay motivated 🙂


[1/14/2022 2:53 PM] tux_linux
Welp, the main game changer first was that originally InkBox was developed as a Nickel add-on. Once I decided to port it as a real OS as it is now, motivation was relieved.
After that, the huge KoBox project gave me enough to survive three months, until July 4th, when all release announcements for 1.5 were done. I received *a lot* of positive feedback :D
But then I was exhausted. Did not touch that during several days.
Then came 1.6, 1.7 during the summer which namely introduced search and PDF support.
1.8 was quite one of the biggest, but the challenge given by @FxFyu1v1 about encrypted storage motivated me till the end. I wouldn't do it again ;p
Now here I am ready, or almost, for 1.9, thanks to people like you, @dill , @rsjn and others that give me feature suggestions and report bugs :)

I'll probably make a dependency list for Debian-based systems sometime this weekend to make it work

Also, the emulator has its own private key which is public, so your can sign whatever you want with it and it'll work

[1/14/2022 3:01 PM] tux_linux
Actually, I realised you better should do your add-on on X11/KoBox, because the Libra has had some problems with Qt: when it's been a long time you haven't touched anything on the screen, it freezes, can register input but cannot print anything on the display


[1/14/2022 3:01 PM] tux_linux
It does not happen under X11 though


[1/14/2022 3:05 PM] tux_linux
So yeah, Golang would be a good option, assuming the version provided by Alpine 3.10 is recent enough
(or you'll have to create yourself another chroot of more recent Alpine inside KoBox, also possible I guess)


[1/14/2022 3:05 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, the extension could mount a squashfs or a disk image and it would chroot into it to run the program

It requires an upgraded Raspberry Pi Zero to a 2W to get wifi and bluetooth which I just paid a guy to finish


[1/14/2022 5:55 PM] tux_linux

Wrong forum hang on


[1/14/2022 5:57 PM] daboone72
Yes will use the Libra and the Pi inside the board get them to talk to each other


[1/14/2022 5:58 PM] tux_linux
Nice
Maybe it could be possible to do it all on the Kobo? Don't know what it requires, is it just software or does it interface with hardware with connections to the GPIO?


[1/14/2022 6:00 PM] daboone72
The idea is to build an API on the chess board to push the moves to the Libra to display them on a much much much larger eink dispay 2.9 inch 296x128 pixels  versus 7 inch Libra 1680x1264 🙂


[1/14/2022 6:01 PM] daboone72
They need to talk to each otherwise there's no point.


[1/14/2022 6:01 PM] daboone72
The display logic will be on the Kobo as the display logic on the board is for the tiny dsisplay


[1/14/2022 6:01 PM] tux_linux
Oh


[1/14/2022 6:02 PM] daboone72
The API will just pass move details and history over.

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/14/2022 6:02 PM] daboone72
So move on the board becomes a visible move Kobo and with the touch screen it's easier to set up the board on the Kobo so will implement an API the other way too


[1/14/2022 6:03 PM] daboone72
The end goal to make puzzle and post game analysis much easier


[1/14/2022 6:03 PM] tux_linux

Anyway the blob on the top right is supposed to be a mirror of the actual screen I want to be sure it's at least 2.9 inches tall


[1/14/2022 6:16 PM] tux_linux
The status thing?


[1/14/2022 6:17 PM] daboone72
Second down the Double sized 296x128 thing


[1/14/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
It will be mirrored on "Buttons"?


[1/14/2022 6:19 PM] daboone72
No buttons is to mirro the board buttons so there's quite a bit of room but triple sized will reduce it to almost nothing vertically


[1/14/2022 6:19 PM] daboone72
Will have to change the layout somehow to compensate


[1/14/2022 6:20 PM] tux_linux
I'm not sure I follow


[1/14/2022 6:20 PM] daboone72
Ahh nut it will nedd to be triple


[1/14/2022 6:21 PM] daboone72
It's 8 units high out of 19 so 2.9 inches x 2 would be 5.8 inches I can't imagine the Libra having a display 5.9 inches tall


[1/14/2022 6:22 PM] tux_linux
Measured with a thumb it seems around 4.5"


[1/14/2022 6:23 PM] daboone72

@tux-linux  Woohoo https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=go&branch=v3.15&arch=armv7  go 1.17.4-rc0 (edited)  for Alpine Linux 3.15  the latest version is go 1.17.6 so nothing in it


[1/14/2022 7:54 PM] daboone72
Architecture v7 arm right


[1/14/2022 7:55 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[1/14/2022 7:56 PM] daboone72
Ahh I need it under Kobox though but I guess still Alpine


[1/14/2022 7:56 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[1/14/2022 7:56 PM] tux_linux
Alpine 3.10, so you should make an extension involving a chroot


[1/14/2022 7:56 PM] daboone72
Kobox is just the X windows host


[1/14/2022 7:57 PM] daboone72
Ohh bugger 3.10 I thought it wsas 3.15


[1/14/2022 7:57 PM] tux_linux
There


[1/14/2022 7:57 PM] tux_linux
It can't be 3.15 otherwise it wouldn't run on Mini for example


[1/14/2022 7:57 PM] daboone72
Ok so 1.12.12-r0 under v3.10 let me see


[1/14/2022 7:59 PM] daboone72
Well there is source code so maybe I can build a new one


[1/14/2022 7:59 PM] tux_linux
You could, but honestly a chroot would be simpler


[1/14/2022 8:00 PM] tux_linux
You just make an extension containing a disk image with Alpine 3.15 and you make a script telling the https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/xorg.sh process to mount required things and launch your program into the chroot


[1/14/2022 8:00 PM] daboone72
Hmm will lose file  access to everywhere else then perhaps it doesn't matter


[1/14/2022 8:00 PM] tux_linux
You can use bind-mounts


[1/14/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
And named pipes


[1/14/2022 8:01 PM] daboone72
Suppose there is a lightweight base Alpine and as you say just add go.


[1/14/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
Yep


[1/14/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
And Python or anything else you want


[1/14/2022 8:02 PM] daboone72
Fair enough we can call the developer partition


[1/14/2022 8:02 PM] daboone72
call it


[1/14/2022 8:02 PM] tux_linux
Developer partition?


[1/14/2022 8:02 PM] daboone72
Well add make, configure other useful bits and bobs


[1/14/2022 8:02 PM] tux_linux
Yeah


[1/14/2022 8:03 PM] tux_linux
You can also set up a QEMU-arm virtual machine to compile without needing to cross-compile (much better, although slower)


[1/14/2022 8:03 PM] daboone72
Maybe another too for just containing the libs and the binary


[1/14/2022 8:03 PM] daboone72
release image as it were


[1/14/2022 8:03 PM] tux_linux
A developer extension, maybe?


[1/14/2022 8:04 PM] daboone72
I was thinkiing that qemu-arm better for testing no exceptions


[1/14/2022 8:04 PM] daboone72
Using a mount overlay sort of thing?


[1/14/2022 8:04 PM] tux_linux
Yes, maybe
Then you would need two separate extensions, they'd get merged at boot


[1/14/2022 8:05 PM] tux_linux
But why wouldn't you just put all into just one?


[1/14/2022 8:05 PM] daboone72
Just dev tools could be heavy and source libs etc


[1/14/2022 8:05 PM] daboone72
Space wise I mean


[1/14/2022 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Oh, dev tools for debugging your program?


[1/14/2022 8:05 PM] daboone72
Also ideally they would have debug source in them so can attach a debugger and make sense of what is happening


[1/14/2022 8:06 PM] tux_linux
hmm hmm


[1/14/2022 8:06 PM] daboone72
Well building and developing


[1/14/2022 8:06 PM] daboone72
I'll know more when I make the image maybe it won't be that heavy


[1/14/2022 8:06 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, so the "production" extension wouldn't absolutely require the dev tools


[1/14/2022 8:06 PM] tux_linux
Fair warning: KoBox extensions exportable storage image size is 512M


[1/14/2022 8:07 PM] daboone72
That's what I was thinking keep it like Golang is compiled not like Python interepted


[1/14/2022 8:07 PM] tux_linux
So ideally, your extension should be <100M without dev tools


[1/14/2022 8:07 PM] daboone72
That seems plausible ches library, http library, and qt


[1/14/2022 8:08 PM] tux_linux
You want qt too?


[1/14/2022 8:08 PM] daboone72
Well if it can see the Inkbox qt all is well but chroot I suspect not


[1/14/2022 8:08 PM] daboone72
Anyway I'd want the qt to match the go version and all that jaz

There's no Qt in KoBox chroot


[1/14/2022 8:08 PM] tux_linux
Only GTK


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
And the problem about InkBox Qt on Libra


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] daboone72
Well don't fancy GTK


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
Me neither


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] daboone72
I know that's why you said under X as I recall


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, golang requires Qt?


[1/14/2022 8:09 PM] daboone72
No issues under the other way as I recall


[1/14/2022 8:10 PM] daboone72
No but my App will it's graphical after all


[1/14/2022 8:10 PM] tux_linux
Oh, there are Qt bindings?


[1/14/2022 8:10 PM] daboone72
Yes golang and Qt play nicely together


[1/14/2022 8:10 PM] tux_linux
I was going to say at this point you should just use C++ but hey, do whatever you want 😉


[1/14/2022 8:11 PM] daboone72
I know that would be your choice but I fancy learning something new and with built in garbage colleciton and easy multi CPU threading.


[1/14/2022 8:12 PM] tux_linux
Yeah sure, that's some nice thing about Go


[1/14/2022 8:12 PM] daboone72
Then later I can use it for some fun OpenGL


[1/14/2022 8:13 PM] daboone72
So 100Megabytes only but I guess that could be raised if neessary


[1/14/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, but can't exceed 512M


[1/14/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
100M would just be the limit of "fair use" of the exportable extension storage


[1/14/2022 8:14 PM] daboone72
There's alot of stuff in Qt no doubt it can be trimed down.


[1/14/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
(which you can access there)

Ohh I see there's glue already in place for extensions ok


[1/14/2022 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, there is a Commodore 64 emulator available as an extension


[1/14/2022 8:16 PM] tux_linux
.


[1/14/2022 8:16 PM] daboone72
So step 1 make a lightweight Alpine and add the libs hmm seems like I'm going to have to trim it down from the start shame.


[1/14/2022 8:17 PM] daboone72
Why all these weird issues with devices. Libra not working with Qt. It's crazy


[1/14/2022 8:18 PM] tux_linux
i know


[1/14/2022 8:18 PM] daboone72
I don't hear of cases of this with the Raspberry Pi ./cofnigure; make done


[1/14/2022 8:18 PM] daboone72
Maybe should convert to Gentoo


[1/14/2022 8:18 PM] tux_linux
I guess having an e-Ink screen already complicates life


[1/14/2022 8:19 PM] daboone72
X is a protocol though supposed to get rid of that hassle


[1/14/2022 8:19 PM] tux_linux
Well, even X needs a custom middleware to work

[1/14/2022 8:20 PM] daboone72
If it's not updating right or somthing I'd say it's aproblem with he display driver not the Qt libray


[1/14/2022 8:20 PM] tux_linux
Maybe, never found out the cause of the problem


[1/14/2022 8:20 PM] daboone72
It makes me worried going to get some peculiar unfixable bugs down the line


[1/14/2022 8:21 PM] tux_linux
You'll sure get some


[1/14/2022 8:21 PM] tux_linux
Happens all the time with me


[1/14/2022 8:21 PM] tux_linux
It's so specific that I'm like "Ok, let's track down this thing to its core, anyway there's no available documentation for that at all"


[1/14/2022 8:22 PM] daboone72
I'd better add a redraw display button


[1/14/2022 8:22 PM] tux_linux
yep


[1/14/2022 8:24 PM] daboone72
Hmm stuff to think about

i mean i know its a lot of work but maybe a complete UI revamp


[1/15/2022 2:38 AM] tux_linux
What would need to be done?


[1/15/2022 2:38 AM] the.mightydill
it's already a very very good UI but i think you could do it


[1/15/2022 2:38 AM] the.mightydill
let me see


[1/15/2022 2:38 AM] the.mightydill
*opens ms paint\*

[1/15/2022 2:41 AM] the.mightydill
hear me out


[1/15/2022 2:41 AM] the.mightydill
so the books are on the top half, maybe 3 or 4


[1/15/2022 2:41 AM] the.mightydill
and then file manager or "my files"


[1/15/2022 2:42 AM] the.mightydill
on the bottom, "home, books, library, and more"


[1/15/2022 2:42 AM] the.mightydill
"more" being Apps and Settings


[1/15/2022 2:44 AM] tux_linux
Not really sure


[1/15/2022 2:44 AM] the.mightydill
the kobo has the best shape, i know


[1/15/2022 2:44 AM] tux_linux
Maybe a killer feature that's not related to the UI?

BAHAHAHAHA


[1/15/2022 2:46 AM] tux_linux
Hmm hmm
That would be great, yeah
Only thing would be to restrict access to terminal/consoles for non-rooted devices


[1/15/2022 2:46 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[1/15/2022 2:46 AM] tux_linux
Which is kind of hard


[1/15/2022 2:47 AM] tux_linux
Since there are so many hacks about how to open a terminal from whatever app existing


[1/15/2022 2:47 AM] the.mightydill
ohh yeah true


[1/15/2022 2:47 AM] the.mightydill
wait


[1/15/2022 2:48 AM] the.mightydill
rooted means that you have access to the root user right


[1/15/2022 2:48 AM] tux_linux
Yes, well a root shell


[1/15/2022 2:48 AM] the.mightydill
so that means you could still have terminal access without accessing root


[1/15/2022 2:48 AM] the.mightydill
like, `user`


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] tux_linux
We thought the same thing at the same time


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] the.mightydill
lol


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] the.mightydill
great minds think alike


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] tux_linux
I guess it's a matter of bind-mounting passwd


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] the.mightydill
bind-whatwhatwhat


[1/15/2022 2:49 AM] tux_linux
look it up


[1/15/2022 2:50 AM] the.mightydill
what does it have to do with inkbox


[1/15/2022 2:50 AM] tux_linux
It's mostly for directories, but you can also bind-mount files

yeah


[1/15/2022 2:51 AM] tux_linux
A bit like symlinks, but it works in chroots too


[1/15/2022 2:51 AM] the.mightydill
ohhhh got it


[1/15/2022 2:51 AM] the.mightydill
so where would you bindmount passwd


[1/15/2022 2:52 AM] tux_linux
From some extension, or maybe just from the xorg.sh launch script in the rootfs


[1/15/2022 2:52 AM] tux_linux
A bit like what's done by the initrd


[1/15/2022 2:52 AM] the.mightydill
yeah


[1/15/2022 2:52 AM] the.mightydill
so, it could be done?

Hi @tux-linux , I'm trying to work out how to use the inkbox emulator. It gets most of the way through bootstrap.sh but crashes with: usr/gen_initramfs.sh: Cannot open '/home/build/inkbox/kernel/initrd/busybox-1.32.1/_install-emu/'


[1/15/2022 11:07 AM] btwarch147
Any idea how to fix it?


[1/15/2022 11:08 AM] daboone72
@btwarch147  Did it fail to pull busybox? I haven't done the process myself yet but that wouldbe my guess.


[1/15/2022 11:20 AM] btwarch147

[1/15/2022 12:38 PM] btwarch147
yup


[1/15/2022 4:33 PM] tux_linux
Hello, yeah, actually I didn't upload the emu image, that's why there isn't really any documentation on the GitHub repo


[1/15/2022 4:33 PM] tux_linux
I'll put one there, won't be really 1.8, but more like current Git commit, so you get the newest features


[1/15/2022 4:34 PM] tux_linux
Thanks for the progress bar!
For the rest, what--


[1/15/2022 4:36 PM] tux_linux
You need to change the initrd location in the kernel config.
Edit `[kernel-repo]/kernel/config/config-emu`
Search for `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE` and change the location to `[kernel-repo]/initrd/busybox-1.32.1/_install-emu`
`[kernel-repo]` being the location of the cloned repository, without the brackets.


[1/15/2022 4:39 PM] tux_linux
I suggest you reboot, delete the `emu` repository and re-clone it, or `git reset --hard && git clean -f` on it to start fresh


[1/15/2022 5:07 PM] tux_linux
@btwarch147 It's live now, there http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/1.8/emu/
`git pull` the repo if you don't delete it too, because I changed the update package name slightly since it isn't the same as for other devices


[1/15/2022 5:40 PM] btwarch147
@tux-linux Thanks for your help, looks like I don't have permission to access it

See need images in your e-reader first Smaug second rather nice art. From The Hobbit illustrated


[1/15/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
You should be able to now


[1/15/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux
I know, but that means a complete render engine change
Maybe PDFs on the Libra could look nice


[1/15/2022 5:57 PM] tux_linux

[1/15/2022 5:58 PM] daboone72

[1/15/2022 5:59 PM] daboone72
Afraid I will be switching to  post marketOs


[1/15/2022 5:59 PM] tux_linux
Just because I don't support images?


[1/15/2022 6:00 PM] daboone72
Yes I tend to read stuff with images , science type books


[1/15/2022 6:01 PM] tux_linux
I mean, when you're the only one writing this program and it's been 10 months with no contribution whatsoever in the code from anyone, I guess I can say that I don't have the courage and time to implement it


[1/15/2022 6:01 PM] tux_linux
Read this, you'll probably see why it would be a nightmare to yet again change the render engine: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/master/reader.cpp

in general, building for others and worrying about popularity leads to frustration (I am in industry for 15 years)


[1/15/2022 6:04 PM] db.qp.db
building for yourself and to learn brings fulfillment. best is to build for underserved community (which I think you are doing)


[1/15/2022 6:06 PM] tux_linux
Of course I am!
I'm just, sometimes, frustrated about people not replying to the InkBox thread at Mobileread when I release something new (e.g. 1.5 release with X11 subsystem, new ePUB engine, tons and tons of improvements got virtually no direct replies), and about people registering in this server but actually never sending anything.
I don't want to be selfish or anything, but InkBox has features that no other reader software on the market has, e.g. KTerm out-of-the-box when device is rooted, encrypted storage, seamless Qt/X11 integration (Kindles only have X11). Other great features but that exist also somewhere else could be the strict security policy, heavy package signing ensuring everything is genuine, and all the pain and effort that has gone through it, wasting a part of my life for something I like to do, through those 10 months.


[1/15/2022 6:08 PM] tux_linux
Sorry for the rant


[1/15/2022 6:09 PM] tux_linux
Yeah.

[1/15/2022 6:44 PM] tux_linux
Thanks


[1/15/2022 6:45 PM] tux_linux
Unless they replace the entire OS, I doubt it is very portable


[1/15/2022 6:49 PM] tux_linux
Just to be clear, the "you" in the rant wasn't addressed at you at all, I was just speaking generally 🙂


[1/15/2022 6:51 PM] tux_linux
Neither was it addressed at Daboone72, Dill/Elektron, FxFyu1v1, sausageboy, or anyone else here that has contributed, talked or anything that's different from not doing anything


[1/15/2022 6:53 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Thanks for clearing that up.

[1/15/2022 6:55 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Was just checking MuPDF see if they have updated their code. It does support CBZ now comic book zip so must have image handling internally.


[1/15/2022 6:55 PM] tux_linux
Well, I use mutool to convert PDFs to PNGs, but the thing is that other than that it doesn't seem to do it for ePUBs


[1/15/2022 6:56 PM] daboone72
Or rather mutool convert on their mupdf website


[1/15/2022 6:56 PM] tux_linux
I didn't know CBZ was supported, maybe it arrived recently


[1/15/2022 6:56 PM] tux_linux
Might add that to InkBox


[1/15/2022 6:56 PM] the.mightydill
what what what


[1/15/2022 6:57 PM] daboone72
Elektron it was my idea shared encrypted with Rot13  that probably won't happen anytime soon. Have images displayed in color on an external device like a mobile phone or another tablet


[1/15/2022 6:57 PM] daboone72
https://rot13.com/


[1/15/2022 6:57 PM] the.mightydill
ohh got it


[1/15/2022 7:01 PM] daboone72
Tux I wouldn't stress on layout either a QVertical and a QGraphic minexpandable always min and a QText expandable and you could pop an image on the page when necessary. Just been playing with QT designer it is really good as this sort of dynamic layout stuff.


[1/15/2022 7:02 PM] tux_linux
Actually, it seems you can insert an image into a QTextEdit: https://forum.qt.io/topic/91271/how-to-insert-an-image-on-qtextedit/5

[1/15/2022 7:03 PM] tux_linux
The main issue would be to get mutool to tell us when an image needs to be displayed


[1/15/2022 7:03 PM] the.mightydill
right so maybe a UI revamp, more apps, and ||external keyboard and mouse||?


[1/15/2022 7:04 PM] tux_linux
Unless you buy an externally-powered USB dongle somewhere, it won't work


[1/15/2022 7:04 PM] tux_linux
Kobos can't supply enough power for this


[1/15/2022 7:04 PM] the.mightydill
yeah that's what i was aiming for, if those exist


[1/15/2022 7:04 PM] the.mightydill
do they


[1/15/2022 7:04 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[1/15/2022 7:05 PM] the.mightydill
yeah then you *could\* do that


[1/15/2022 7:05 PM] tux_linux
You could also just set your RPi into a VNC server and connect to it in the Kobo with the VNC viewer
Mouse & keyboard would be connected to your RPi


[1/15/2022 7:07 PM] daboone72
I was even thinking of doing the thing in a browser it's mostly Json ajax and it seems everyone get's around to putting a browser on their devices


[1/15/2022 7:08 PM] tux_linux
It's because... QtWebEngine doesn't work on Kobos


[1/15/2022 7:08 PM] tux_linux
Because... shitty hardware and RAM


[1/15/2022 7:08 PM] tux_linux
(probably)


[1/15/2022 7:08 PM] tux_linux
Everytime we got Chromium installed onto most devices, it crashed without explanation


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] tux_linux
The only thing that reliably works is the Gecko engine with Palemoon on the Libra


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] daboone72
Ahh so the KDE won't work either even though it's in QT


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] tux_linux
(Chromium = QtWebEngine)


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] daboone72
Ohh CHromimum QT as well pain


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] tux_linux
Yes ;p


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] the.mightydill
yeah but the kobo mini has some wifi problems


[1/15/2022 7:09 PM] daboone72
I see muPDF also have a commercial version that's probably why they are holding back the good stuff


[1/15/2022 7:10 PM] tux_linux
I experimented with QtWebKit on X, but I couldn't get it to compile on native Qt
It would probably have been good enough for displaying ePUBs


[1/15/2022 7:10 PM] tux_linux
Though the thing there is that the entire Reader class will need to be re-written if InkBox changes to a web-based reader


[1/15/2022 7:11 PM] tux_linux
You can connect via USBNet


[1/15/2022 7:11 PM] tux_linux
And you connect to VNC server 192.168.2.1


[1/15/2022 7:11 PM] daboone72
Yes indeed reading about the epub making process you name theimages sequentially 001,002


[1/15/2022 7:11 PM] the.mightydill
i know this could be fu||ck||ing hard but you could also get rid of the page turn buttons and make the reader like nickel's one


[1/15/2022 7:11 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, you're right about this
It is hard


[1/15/2022 7:12 PM] tux_linux
Because we'd need some QGestures of some sort


[1/15/2022 7:12 PM] tux_linux
Or maybe a transparent overlaid widget with invisible buttons


[1/15/2022 7:12 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, that could be better


[1/15/2022 7:13 PM] tux_linux
But then again, it would half-work since the only things you could do while reading would be to go to previous page, next page, or open Options
No dictionnary search


[1/15/2022 7:13 PM] the.mightydill
oh... right


[1/15/2022 7:13 PM] the.mightydill
> like nickel's one
only in terms of turning pages though


[1/15/2022 7:14 PM] db.qp.db
i'm afraid of this downloading and running stuff for the emu with sudo


[1/15/2022 7:14 PM] tux_linux
You might use a VM if you prefer


[1/15/2022 7:15 PM] db.qp.db
that's in order to get the filesystem permissions correct, right?


[1/15/2022 7:15 PM] tux_linux
I could've used fakeroot


[1/15/2022 7:15 PM] tux_linux
yeah


[1/15/2022 7:15 PM] db.qp.db
yeh, probably fakeroot then


[1/15/2022 7:16 PM] tux_linux
But you can look at the release.sh script if you want, it's not harmful at all


[1/15/2022 7:16 PM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/release.sh


[1/15/2022 7:16 PM] tux_linux
I run it as root all the time here


[1/15/2022 7:18 PM] tux_linux
I'm testing it on a Debian VM right now, will get back to you with deps


[1/15/2022 7:18 PM] tux_linux
(because it's not a good idea to run the script twice)


[1/15/2022 7:19 PM] db.qp.db
generally, i wouldn't run a script from someone as root even if they say its safe


[1/15/2022 7:19 PM] tux_linux
(or you have to deal with unmounting /tmp/inkbox/* and disconnecting nbd0, then cleaning up all of this)


[1/15/2022 7:19 PM] tux_linux
Well, up to you to judge


[1/15/2022 7:20 PM] tux_linux
But maybe a VM is better for this
You'll run a VM inside the VM, but hey, it works anyway


[1/15/2022 7:21 PM] tux_linux
I forgot about fakeroot while making the script, that's why it isn't there


[1/15/2022 7:28 PM] tux_linux
Wow it failed because `bc` was missing 😅


[1/15/2022 7:30 PM] db.qp.db
i'm trying it with fakeroot instead of sudo


[1/15/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
Though, kernel building also runs things as root, to preserve ownership in initrds


[1/15/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
So maybe a Debian VM would be better


[1/15/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
See here https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/scripts/build_kernel.sh


[1/15/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
IIRC it's just basic `mkdir` and `cp`, so shouldn't be too harmful


[1/15/2022 8:10 PM] tux_linux
@rsjn: Got it working on Debian 11 with the following dependencies:
`sudo apt install build-essential qemu-system-arm git u-boot-tools swig python-dev python3-dev bison flex squashfs-tools bc`


[1/15/2022 8:11 PM] tux_linux
You may add `-nographic` to the `qemu-boot` script to boot in console-only mode
Also, you can add `-snapshot` for a non-persistent boot


[1/15/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
To connect to the Qt VNC server once it starts (a few minutes maximum after udhcpc gets its lease), connect to port 5901 on host VM/PC. If it closes when you do a particular action, for example getting out of Settings, try connecting again after a few seconds, it means the application has restarted.

what format? virtualbox? qemu? vmware?


[1/15/2022 8:29 PM] tux_linux
Well, if you ran the emulator from a VM


[1/15/2022 8:29 PM] tux_linux
Doesn't matter


[1/15/2022 8:29 PM] db.qp.db
ok, but i want to know what you did


[1/15/2022 8:30 PM] tux_linux
Well, I use XCP-ng here to manage my VMs on the LAN, the hypervizor is Xen


[1/15/2022 8:30 PM] tux_linux
You can use `qemu-system-x86_64`


[1/15/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
e.g. `qemu-system-x86_64 -hda debian.img -cdrom debian.iso -enable-kvm -m 8G`
Create `debian.img` like this: `qemu-img create -f qcow2 debian.img 32G`


[1/15/2022 8:31 PM] db.qp.db
for some reason i thought you were a student


[1/15/2022 8:31 PM] tux_linux
I am one


[1/15/2022 8:32 PM] tux_linux
But... what does that have to do with this?


[1/15/2022 8:33 PM] db.qp.db
dunno, sounds like you have a second machine running VMs


[1/15/2022 8:33 PM] tux_linux
It was given by a company which offered me work
Mac Pro 128G RAM, 12C/24T


[1/15/2022 8:33 PM] tux_linux
It's quite useful


[1/15/2022 8:34 PM] db.qp.db
i'll likely just make a qemu image running debian and then run the bootstrap in it, but the less work i have to do the better


[1/15/2022 8:34 PM] db.qp.db
if you want to put a pre-made qemu image up, that would be nice


[1/15/2022 8:35 PM] tux_linux
Maybe there are some already-made Debian QEMU images out there


[1/15/2022 8:35 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, true


[1/15/2022 8:35 PM] db.qp.db
yes, there are


[1/15/2022 8:35 PM] db.qp.db
that's why i was asking you what you did, usually distros publish a few VM images in different formats


[1/15/2022 8:36 PM] tux_linux
Well, I took the Debian netinstaller and started from scratch on a new VM, to see what deps were required to successfully execute the bootstrap script and boot the emulator with no problems


[1/15/2022 8:37 PM] tux_linux
Do you have a machine with fairly decent specs? Because emulating ARM is quite the task for the CPU... 😅


[1/15/2022 8:39 PM] db.qp.db
yeah, i have a pretty good machine for work stuff


[1/15/2022 8:39 PM] db.qp.db
not sure i will use that for this, though


[1/15/2022 8:39 PM] db.qp.db
usually i use my laptops


[1/15/2022 8:40 PM] tux_linux
Nice
The main VM I use for emulating InkBox has 16G RAM, 8 cores and 150GB storage
I guess 4G of RAM could do, emulator is just using 1G, and 4 cores should be enough for a minimum configuration


[1/15/2022 8:41 PM] db.qp.db
yeh, this is what i meant about being a student. as a student, i had a dinky laptop


[1/15/2022 8:42 PM] tux_linux
On the scratch machine I just tested it in, it was horrendously slow, probably because I have only 1 CPU core
On my main machine, it runs quite fast though, almost the same speed as Kobos when fully started up


[1/15/2022 8:42 PM] tux_linux
Up until September, I had a Dell Latitude E5530, which was... okay, but clearly not enough for what I was doing on it 😅


[1/15/2022 8:43 PM] tux_linux
Once September arrived, a guy from the company that wants me to work for them donated a desktop PC and a ThinkPad T450, which was a much-needed hardware upgrade

So now Gentoo runs well on it and InkBox compiles in 30s 👍


[1/15/2022 8:46 PM] tux_linux
I'll see if I can make you a pre-installed emulator QEMU image

which kobos do you have?


[1/15/2022 8:52 PM] tux_linux

Aura and Glo HD are half-working though (broken screen)


[1/15/2022 10:17 PM] daboone72
Well can still use Inkbox on the Mini to make PDF handy reference cards. 
Libre Office Page Config to make Mini screen size B6 (ISO) with the right margins get's you there

[1/15/2022 10:18 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Question is how does Inkbox convert PDF fonts perhaps have to export with them embedded or something


[1/15/2022 10:35 PM] tux_linux
Letter sized PDFs work well too
Basically, InkBox takes the PDF and tells mutool to convert a page of it to a PNG image, then displays that PNG image onto a QGraphicsView


[1/15/2022 10:36 PM] tux_linux
So the fonts are converted by mutool


[1/15/2022 10:36 PM] daboone72
I see there is a scale option but no sort of fit to screen


[1/15/2022 10:37 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, no
But it's already fit to screen by InkBox


[1/15/2022 10:37 PM] daboone72
Maybe jsut getting the aspect ratio right is the main thing


[1/15/2022 10:38 PM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/7af178f9e509d9c909b95d30be9aaca5254a7e1d/functions.h#L525-L564


[1/15/2022 10:38 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it's roughly that


[1/15/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
There are the default page sizes that are handed to mutool which will convert the PDF in a PNG with that resolution


[1/15/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
So as you said, it's only the aspect ratio


[1/15/2022 10:40 PM] daboone72
Just thinking to work out DPI of screen too which is probably still high


[1/15/2022 10:45 PM] daboone72
200dpi 100/25.4 = 3.9 inches 800 pixels /3.9 = 203.2 dots per inch  yes thought so and smae horizontal 75mm / 25.4 = 2.9527 inches 600 / 2.952 = 203.2 dpi


[1/15/2022 10:45 PM] tux_linux
Kobo Mini has 170 dpi


[1/15/2022 10:53 PM] daboone72
Font size experiments 10 small 12 nice especially Arial

SSH to the Kobo and do this
`chroot /kobo fbgrab /tmp/screen.png`
then SCP `/kobo/tmp/screen.png` to your computer

it takes a screenshot

File choosing window might be buttons missing like close open and scroll


[1/15/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, unfortunately I don't know how to fix that
Doesn't happen on models with bigger screens like Glo

@tux-linux how do you test inkbox on all the readers? manually?


[1/16/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
Yep


[1/16/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
But what do you mean exactly?


[1/16/2022 12:27 AM] tux_linux
I have one unified rootfs and separate kernels, so I don't always test a new release on all models, I can afford to check just one for example


[1/16/2022 12:28 AM] db.qp.db
yeah, i was wondering how you handled coordinate rotation (for example) - if you went and tested all devices


[1/16/2022 12:28 AM] db.qp.db
once you have everything setup well, i imagine you don't have to re-test all devices


[1/16/2022 12:29 AM] tux_linux
Yeah

@rsjn : Unfortunately, the compressed QEMU image file weighs 5.3G, which causes two problems:
1) I can't really upload it anywhere, and space is fairly limited at 23.163.0.39;
2) Even if I could, it would take ages on my 200KB/s upload connection, and no one in the house here wants a bandwidth throttle for 5+ hrs ;p

I suggest you install Debian 11 on a VM (from the netinstall iso, select "SSH server" and "Standard system utilities" whilst installing) with the following packages:
```
sudo apt install build-essential qemu-system-arm git u-boot-tools swig python-dev python3-dev bison flex squashfs-tools bc openbox tint2 xdm xinit gnome-terminal tigervnc-viewer
```
And you add this to your `~/.config/openbox/start.sh`:
```
tint2 &
```
Reboot.
Then, you clone the `emu` repository and you run `env GITDIR=${PWD} ./bootstrap.sh`, you start the emulator from X11 and connect to the VNC server with `vncviewer` (TigerVNC) at `127.0.0.1:5901`.
There's probably a way to map again the port to your host machine so you can access it there too. But that basic setup will work otherwise.


[1/16/2022 6:10 AM] db.qp.db
what's the easiest device to flash with the OS?


[1/16/2022 6:11 AM] tux_linux
Anything of N905C, N905B, N613 or N705
i.e. Touch C, B, Glo or Mini


[1/16/2022 6:12 AM] tux_linux
I suggest Touch B, although slower than Glo you'll have Wi-Fi support


[1/16/2022 10:53 AM] btwarch147
@tux-linux I managed to get it compiled, however when I run QEMU using the scrpt it powers down with "Flash device refused suspend due to active operation (state 20)"

You should `git pull` the repo, there's a missing make_devicenodes.sh step that fixes the impossible boot problem you're having

@tux-linux  The N613 ,N705 have no wifi. N905C does it have wifi?


[1/16/2022 11:29 AM] tux_linux
Nope, only N905B due to it using a different chipset (imx508)


[1/16/2022 11:30 AM] daboone72
So that's advertised as the Touch B I guess


[1/16/2022 11:30 AM] tux_linux

[1/16/2022 11:33 AM] tux_linux
Yeah ...
Touch N905A (original) has an eMMC, that's why it wasn't my first choice


[1/16/2022 11:35 AM] tux_linux
Though someone did find a way not a long time ago to un-brick the device if ever it happened : https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4185784&postcount=11

Well ok, maybe not entirely un-brick but anyway

You can get a working Linux on again afterwards I guess


[1/16/2022 11:37 AM] daboone72
Dual boot btw would be a great place to get too with the ones with swappable cards


[1/16/2022 11:38 AM] tux_linux
No, they're too expensive
I have some testers on the Git repository, but communication is fairly slow
It's better to have the device in hand when I want to port InkBox to it


[1/16/2022 11:38 AM] daboone72
Pity no Wifi on the GLO I quite liiked the resolution 1024x768


[1/16/2022 11:40 AM] tux_linux
The problem with the dual-boot for devices with external SD cards is that U-Boot (bootloader) loads the same kernel for two rootfs, so basically InkBox wouldn't work at all.
What it does is just change the bootargs from root=/dev/mmcblk0px to /dev/mmcblk1px


[1/16/2022 11:40 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, actually 1024x758 but I agree

Well, FBInk on mine clearly says 1024x758 ;p


[1/16/2022 11:41 AM] daboone72
On the right side it says 768  it is wrong I mean. Listed as 1024x758 later


[1/16/2022 11:42 AM] tux_linux
The nice thing about the Glo is that it's slightly faster but has the same chipset
It's overclocked to 1GHz
Mini & Touch are at 800MHz
Maybe there could be a way to overclock those too


[1/16/2022 11:43 AM] tux_linux
Overclocking is done by U-Boot


[1/16/2022 12:12 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Think I've  a plan sell my Kobo Mini buy a Kobo Touch B on ebay to replace it. Buy a Kobo Sage for my daily reading as upgrade to Kindle


[1/16/2022 1:15 PM] tux_linux
Should be a nice move


[1/16/2022 1:16 PM] tux_linux
Be sure to check for the B in the N905 model number

@tux-linux Emulator works great, what would you say my chances of recovery are if I was to attempt to install inkbox on my libra and it went wrong?


[1/16/2022 10:16 PM] tux_linux
90%?


[1/16/2022 10:17 PM] tux_linux
But there's a specific procedure to follow, I got it to work on mine
Tell me when you want to start (if you want to)


[1/16/2022 10:19 PM] tux_linux
You'll preferably need to connect it to serial


[1/16/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
Also, the great thing with the Libra is that you can dual-boot Nickel and InkBox


[1/16/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
There's an SPL kernel that kexec's the appropriate kernel based on a power button event


[1/16/2022 10:40 PM] daboone72
You can that's great


[1/16/2022 10:40 PM] tux_linux
Unfortunately kexec is not reliable on 2.6.35.3 kernels, so porting that for Mini/Touch/Glo is difficult


[1/16/2022 10:41 PM] daboone72
I am deciding between Libra 2 as it's a great bit of hardware and the  Sage which has the has the hand writing option


[1/16/2022 10:42 PM] tux_linux
The Sage is Allwinner-based, so no InkBox support at all there yet (different display driver)
The Libra 2 should be fine

Three wires and a serial to USB adapter, or RPi, or Arduino or whatever that can take serial input


[1/17/2022 2:13 AM] tux_linux
For the wires, you can strip an ethernet cable and get out three wires from it


[1/17/2022 2:15 AM] tux_linux
It seems your Kobo has an eMMC; this makes porting harder, but still possible


[1/17/2022 2:18 AM] tux_linux
Normally, if somehow you brick the device, it will be possible to recover it by downloading a copy of U-Boot (the bootloader) in RAM and then bootstrap the default Nickel factory image.
But there's a lot of things that need to go wrong before we get to that point


[1/17/2022 2:19 AM] tux_linux
My Libra too has an eMMC and I didn't brick it, so it's definitely possible to play safe and keep the device working


[1/17/2022 2:20 AM] tibudiyanto
ok


[1/17/2022 2:20 AM] tibudiyanto

Kobo N905B's though are hard to buy most people don't know what they have. Had to go to a electronic exchange place they are used to identifying them


[1/17/2022 4:57 PM] daboone72

[1/17/2022 4:57 PM] daboone72

[1/17/2022 4:59 PM] daboone72
Ahh it has an SD card slot must be the first edition


[1/17/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
But hey, even if it's not a Touch B, you get the larger screen and a possibility to help debugging Wi-Fi on this crappy Broadcom hardware


[1/17/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
All Touches have an external SD slot


[1/17/2022 5:00 PM] daboone72
The 2.0 went internal didn't it as it's a mini Glo


[1/17/2022 5:00 PM] tux_linux
The Touch 2.0
oh yeah, this thing


[1/17/2022 5:00 PM] tux_linux
Well it's closer to the Glo HD


[1/17/2022 5:00 PM] tux_linux
With a smaller screen resolution


[1/17/2022 5:06 PM] tux_linux
My Touch B's serial number is 88xxx-KBN905B


[1/17/2022 5:19 PM] daboone72
Ok interesting will look at mine when I get it.


[1/17/2022 5:19 PM] daboone72
Meant to ask on the Kobo Forma to cover all bases is that an Allwinner chipset too as well as the Sage?


[1/17/2022 5:19 PM] daboone72
Can't seem to find it with google


[1/17/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
When you get it, a sure way to identify it, is the presence of a closed SD card enclosure as opposed to just a slot on the Touch C


[1/17/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
No, the Forma is i.MX-based


[1/17/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
The Sage & Elipsa have the B300 Allwinner chipset, whilst the Forma has an imx6sll chipset from Freescale/i.MX


[1/17/2022 5:21 PM] daboone72
So that could one day be a valid 8 inch option


[1/17/2022 5:21 PM] tux_linux
Yes, too


[1/17/2022 5:21 PM] tux_linux
Well, I don't know how to deal with the Allwinner ones, but I'm not saying it's impossible to port InkBox to it


[1/17/2022 5:22 PM] daboone72
Libra 2 is the one I am leaning too the most I think 32gb of space out the box and can be upgraded later. Plenty of room to squeze an OS on in addition to the other


[1/17/2022 5:22 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it should be great


[1/17/2022 5:22 PM] daboone72
I expec the forma has the 8gb soldered on eMMc


[1/17/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
My Libra has 8G eMMC and it did fit well


[1/17/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[1/17/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
But now that there are recovery possibilities, it's less dangerous

QEMU actually emulates a Glo with internet access, but yeah, shouldn't be much difference except for the screen resolution

Ohh great I wanted 800x600 for development


[1/17/2022 5:46 PM] tux_linux
But the VNC thing is only for Qt, so you might prefer your Touch for developing under X11


[1/17/2022 5:47 PM] daboone72
Hmm suppose can ssh directly to it.


[1/17/2022 5:47 PM] daboone72

There might be a way of activating fastboot by pressing both the power and a page turn button at the same time while booting


[1/17/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
But you'll need serial port for debugging InkBox kernel


[1/17/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
It also includes a native Linux display driver, quite nice

30 usd for glo hd with charging port issues?


[1/19/2022 9:45 AM] daboone72
@kevin  I wouldn't, have a harder you can get Kobo Touch's for next to nothing all working and they have  swappable SD card and support wifi, to  clarify the N905B does. Tip is get them to give you the serial number or a pic of the bottom of the box the serial number and hence verison N905B will be on there


[1/19/2022 11:22 AM] infinitex
@Daboone72 Where I'm based, kobo touch's are rare and going for 50-70 usd


[1/19/2022 11:29 AM] daboone72
Maybe a Clara HD get tux to give you an image.


[1/19/2022 11:43 AM] daboone72
I could do with an image as well. If he's made one I know he has for the Libra H2O already. That's another way to go


[1/19/2022 11:44 AM] daboone72
Apparently you can multiboot that one. Shame fixed 8Gb on board. But if you check your docs it's hard to get that many


[1/19/2022 11:44 AM] daboone72
Unless your a comic fan


[1/19/2022 12:39 PM] tux_linux
@Daboone72 points are good, but I think I would take it. There's a porting possibility there, plus I might get one soon.
If the Kobo can power on and the charger port can work in some way, I think it would be worth it.


[1/19/2022 12:40 PM] daboone72
But no charging and no connectivity that sucks


[1/19/2022 12:40 PM] daboone72
Swapping a battery over is not cheap I did for the Kobo Mini and ended up at £50

I got alpine 3.1.5 on a virtual machine btw x86 just to start feeling my way round will make setup less painful when do arm. Can't find golang for it yet though. I suspect unconfigured package sources

Great community was commented out why on earth I don't know


[1/19/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
Are you on 3.15 or 3.1.5??


[1/19/2022 5:03 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux alpine-standard-3.15.0-x86_64.iso


[1/19/2022 5:04 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  alpine-virt-3.15.0-armv7.iso was my first choice but there only semeed to be qemu x86 didn't know how to fire it up with the right CPU option


[1/19/2022 7:34 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, qemu-system-arm is quite a bit complicated
It doesn't work out of the box

I might attempt a fix. The port is apparently loose

@tux-linux  I'm thinking of joining your Kobo Clara HD  party the Touch I just bought isn't a B as it turns out confusing grade B I think


[1/20/2022 3:14 PM] daboone72
There's a Kobo Clara HD 24 month warranty for £90 a bit more than I want to spend.  But with yourself working actively I see past 7 days on a version and postmarket proved working even with wifi it's all looking good.


[1/20/2022 3:15 PM] daboone72
And get a decent high res screen 800x600 is lower res that most cheap color screens of 1280x800 or even an old 1024x600


[1/20/2022 7:19 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Update I have bought a Clara HD after trying out the install for postMarketOS


[1/20/2022 7:33 PM] tux_linux
Wow very nice !
Keep me posted, you'll probably be very helpful in porting


[1/20/2022 8:05 PM] db.qp.db
you have postmarket running on it?


[1/20/2022 8:05 PM] db.qp.db
@tux-linux I checked my work machine specs out but haven't figured out the gpu yet


[1/20/2022 8:57 PM] tux_linux
You don't really need a powerful GPU


[1/20/2022 8:57 PM] tux_linux
Only CPU
Graphics are emulated


[1/20/2022 9:14 PM] daboone72
@rsjn No I just compiled the postmarket os image to be sure it was complete enough mainline kernel and multi choice of window managers Wayland nice get RDP access


[1/21/2022 6:23 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux Ahh if you could just get the glo hd going with wifi I'd be  happy man 🙂


[1/22/2022 3:49 AM] tux_linux
It should be possible
The driver is quite easy to port


[1/22/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
@Daboone72 once you get the Clara, create a thread in #porting if you want. Will probably be easier to do that way


[1/22/2022 10:46 PM] infinitex
@tux-linux what equipment required to help port?


[1/22/2022 10:49 PM] tux_linux
Serial connection

I'm kind of surprised by how people say that InkBox is fast.
I just received a donation (thanks go to the someone who donated), and there was a note saying that the someone who donated found the system "stunningly fast". Very nice indeed, but I can't figure out why.
I mean, it takes 2 minutes to boot with X11, ~1 minute without, and there's a giant squashfs/overlayfs/FUSE overhead that slows down the whole system for the benefit of saving space.
Do you find InkBox fast?


[1/25/2022 5:39 PM] db.qp.db
probably the DU updates?


[1/25/2022 5:41 PM] tux_linux
DU, you mean fast eInk refresh?


[1/25/2022 5:58 PM] db.qp.db
yeah


[1/25/2022 6:00 PM] tux_linux
I don't think there is that in InkBox


[1/25/2022 6:00 PM] tux_linux
Not any kind of A2 either even for Mark 7
(fbink-xdamage was not compiled for that)


[1/25/2022 6:01 PM] tux_linux
As for kobo-platform-plugin, I've never seen it doing fast refreshes


[1/25/2022 7:16 PM] ninuje
That's probably because of the contrast with nickel, which is generally terrible at UI interactivity


[1/25/2022 7:19 PM] tux_linux
Maybe you're right... I haven't used Nickel in months


[1/25/2022 8:04 PM] andi15701
hmm, if you are all opening your devices... Do you know a part number or something of that battery connector commonly used


[1/25/2022 8:05 PM] andi15701
seen that one in the Kobo Clara HD, the Tolino Shine 2 HD, the Tolino Shine 3, Probably also in Kobo Glo HD


[1/25/2022 8:05 PM] andi15701
in Libra H2O the battery is soldered...


[1/25/2022 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Nope, maybe you'll learn something of my PCB picture in the Aura 2 thread


[1/25/2022 8:05 PM] andi15701
without connector


[1/25/2022 8:06 PM] andi15701
yes that connector looks same as in tho Kobo Clara HD


[1/25/2022 8:07 PM] andi15701
would like to have something for measuring currents in between, to check for suspend currents, etc.


[1/25/2022 8:08 PM] tux_linux
I have a multimeter here (not available right now though)


[1/25/2022 8:08 PM] tux_linux
I know that some Kobos can work without battery with just USB plugged in


[1/25/2022 8:08 PM] andi15701
yes, they can


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
The Mini can


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] andi15701
probably all with rc5t619 in it


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
But newer ones don't want to boot, probably require too much power


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
it's not tps6185 something?


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] andi15701
that is for the display


[1/25/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
oh


[1/25/2022 8:10 PM] andi15701
but probably the peak currents might give problems


[1/25/2022 8:11 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, the Glo is borderline, it can power on without battery but after a certain time it just freezes for no appparent reason


[1/25/2022 8:11 PM] tux_linux
(probably too much CPU load)


[1/25/2022 8:12 PM] tux_linux
The Touches can work without battery too


[1/25/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
I have a Touch C which is so broken that the battery was forever disconnected and I need to "boost" it over serial with 3.3V VCC after plugging it via USB otherwise it doesn't power on


[1/25/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
Once it is powered on though, it works no problem


[1/25/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
And just USB power is sufficient


[1/25/2022 8:14 PM] andi15701
probably also depends on how thick the wires in the usb cable are


[1/25/2022 8:14 PM] andi15701
and many small mechanical issues


[1/25/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
Maybe


[1/25/2022 8:16 PM] andi15701
about that current measurement thing: I am thinking about automated tests with suspend current, and with the ability to just reconnect the battery and return to normal usage


[1/25/2022 8:16 PM] tux_linux
I know you can hotplug the battery in Kobos


[1/25/2022 8:16 PM] tux_linux
I do that fairly frequently


[1/25/2022 8:18 PM] andi15701
well would like to insert the multimeter betwenn BAT+ and the PCB, so having some adaptor would be nice, and have stable connections, I really would like to see something like a digikey part number for that connector


[1/25/2022 8:19 PM] tux_linux
Maybe could you find that on replacement battery listings?


[1/28/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
@Daboone72 Maybe you should buy an Aura 2 N236 instead; the screen is much better than on the Touch and InkBox support is almost finished for it.
Also I bought a Glo HD earlier today so maybe we'll have a chance to see it ported there too 😉


[1/28/2022 11:20 PM] daboone72
@tux-linux  Thanks though I've spent enough now I have a Touch and a Clara HD


[1/28/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Oh, I thought you didn't buy the Touch yet


[1/28/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Nice anyway


[1/28/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Touch B?


[1/28/2022 11:20 PM] daboone72
The Glo would have been nice but I need a stable distribution


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] daboone72
Yes Touch B N905B


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
What Glo are we talking about?


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
Nice


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] daboone72
Glo HD the one with the Clara screen that's alot cheaper


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
The Kobo Glo itself is fully supported
The Glo HD isn't


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] daboone72
I want Wifi though


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
oh yes


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
true


[1/28/2022 11:21 PM] andi15701
well, Glo HD should be easy to have mainline kernel support


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
that would be awesome


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
it's mx6sl too


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
On my broken one, only the mainboard works, no screen, but it sure can be used for testing
The new one I bought should be nice for InkBox


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] daboone72
Should be but no one's done it yet it seems. Even postmarket OS not much mileage on it yet.


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
@andi is a master on this 🙂


[1/28/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
He ported mainline to Clara HD


[1/28/2022 11:23 PM] daboone72
Bit surprised though looks like will have the pop the case of the Touch as that SD card slot is in addition to the OS


[1/28/2022 11:23 PM] daboone72
Broken Glo?


[1/28/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
Yep
That model also has the strangest internal SD slot I've ever seen


[1/28/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
Well, the screen is borked


[1/28/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
mainboard works


[1/28/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux

[1/28/2022 11:37 PM] tux_linux
that's a lot-


[1/28/2022 11:37 PM] daboone72
And Kobo Glo's go for that here $80-100 here


[1/28/2022 11:37 PM] tux_linux
The Glo HD was $20


[1/28/2022 11:37 PM] tux_linux
(minus shipping)

[1/28/2022 11:37 PM] tux_linux
that was good luck


[1/28/2022 11:38 PM] daboone72
£120 is $205.25 Cnaadian


[1/28/2022 11:38 PM] tux_linux
that's more expensive than in new condition 😂


[1/28/2022 11:38 PM] daboone72

[1/28/2022 11:38 PM] tux_linux

[1/28/2022 11:39 PM] tux_linux
Kobo is based in Canada too, so I guess prices might be slightly lower here


[1/28/2022 11:39 PM] andi15701
well, I got my Clara in 2019 for about 150 CAD equivalent


[1/28/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
The only Kobos I had "new" were the Glo HD somewhere near 2015 and the Libra H2O at full price in July 2020


[1/28/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
The two were worth it


[1/28/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux

and put it into a cover


[1/28/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
that's a nice idea


[1/28/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
I should do that with my Libra


[1/28/2022 11:44 PM] andi15701
and glued a bicycle holder adaptor on it


[1/28/2022 11:45 PM] daboone72
Yay got the protector off already looks better without the bubbles


[1/28/2022 11:45 PM] andi15701

[1/28/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
Only disadvantage is it's difficult to see what's on the display when you're connected to serial


[1/28/2022 11:48 PM] daboone72
@andi  So that's a little daughter circuit board?


[1/28/2022 11:48 PM] andi15701
I have one with just the wires attached, this one has a BLE SoC


[1/28/2022 11:49 PM] andi15701
so I can debug it wireless


[1/28/2022 11:49 PM] tux_linux
that's nice


[1/28/2022 11:49 PM] daboone72
Is it stable bluetooth serial?


[1/28/2022 11:49 PM] andi15701
it is on its limits


[1/28/2022 11:50 PM] andi15701
ordinary bluetooth is not that problematic


[1/28/2022 11:50 PM] andi15701
but BLE is more problematic


[1/28/2022 11:51 PM] andi15701
if I am not using BLE, I have the pogo pins on a small board and just soldered wires on the other side


[1/28/2022 11:52 PM] daboone72
What pitch for the pogo pins to line up with the Tx/Rx?


[1/28/2022 11:52 PM] andi15701
main serial port: 2,54mm


[1/28/2022 11:52 PM] andi15701
secondary I guess 1.5mm or something


[1/28/2022 11:53 PM] andi15701
TP198 is usually another serial port


[1/28/2022 11:53 PM] andi15701
it is not always enabled


[1/28/2022 11:53 PM] andi15701
proven to work on the Kobo Clara HD, the Tolino Shine 3 and the Tolino Shine 2HD


[1/28/2022 11:54 PM] tux_linux
we could test it on the libra if you want


[1/28/2022 11:54 PM] tux_linux
oh actually
is there one


[1/28/2022 11:54 PM] andi15701
hmm, there is no TP198 on the libra I guess


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
Maybe there are no holes


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
just pads


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
and we didn't see it


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] andi15701
yes, TP198 is just pads


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] andi15701
a group of 4 pads


[1/28/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
Oh, I thought you were talking about some other serial port with holes, like the ones you can find on the Glo HD


[1/28/2022 11:56 PM] tux_linux
But Aura 2 has TP198 too


[1/28/2022 11:56 PM] andi15701

I've used a microSD card that's a *bit* larger than the original (64gb vs 4gb lol), does the operating system automatically partition the remaining storage or would I need to create a new one?


[1/29/2022 3:05 AM] tux_linux
No, you would need to extend the onboard file (which is exported on USB) to fit the card


[1/29/2022 3:06 AM] sheepychris
ahh, gotcha


[1/29/2022 3:06 AM] tux_linux
It's on p4/onboard


[1/29/2022 3:06 AM] tux_linux
You could practically just delete it and create a new one


[1/29/2022 3:07 AM] tux_linux
`dd if=/dev/zero of=onboard bs=1M count=8192` for 8G

Netsurf has the magic and mysterious capacity to hang the VNC touch viewer which passes touch input to X

It only happens to Netsurf


[1/29/2022 3:11 AM] tux_linux
You can reset the device


[1/29/2022 3:11 AM] tux_linux
There's a way to quit Netsurf without hanging it


[1/29/2022 3:11 AM] sheepychris
that's a shame, I love netsurf

[2/6/2022 7:18 PM] tux_linux
The **old platform plugin from March** works with all devices except the Glo HD; on it, touch input only works once, and in a "constantly pressed" state, like if you were holding your finger on the button. Once you touch somewhere else, it "releases", then you can touch the same area again and it starts over.
Interesting thing is that there is no way of touching somewhere else and activating something else than what you touched previously.


[2/6/2022 7:20 PM] tux_linux
Also, killing the inkbox-bin process triggers (most of the time) a kernel fault related to `QEvdevTouch`.

@NiLuJe or @andi (or anyone else that would want to help), if you have any insight on this, I would be immensely grateful.
If I don't get touch working with Qt on the Glo HD, support for this device will basically be useless.

well, I guess the real problem there is the overlong kernel commandline


[2/6/2022 9:05 PM] tux_linux
Basically it seems that Qt is not realizing that finger has left the screen and it leaves that button pressed
Now, on to why you cannot press anything else but what you initially clicked after that, I don't know...

at least for that kernel oops in the issue

[2/6/2022 9:20 PM] andi15701
compiling just the Glo HD kernel?


[2/6/2022 9:20 PM] tux_linux
trying to compile the zforce_ts


[2/6/2022 9:20 PM] tux_linux
yeah, with glo hd kernel


[2/6/2022 9:21 PM] tux_linux
(I renamed zforce_ts to zforce_i2c)


[2/6/2022 9:21 PM] andi15701
I doubt that is is helpful


[2/6/2022 9:22 PM] andi15701
there is probably more trouble ahead, even you need to add platform data


[2/6/2022 9:22 PM] tux_linux
yeah, just trying things out
don't know what to do really

The QPA should probably just handle `ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID` properly


[2/6/2022 9:54 PM] ninuje
I mean, what the kernel does is probably wonky,n but then *none* of the Kobo kernels have sane input reports


[2/6/2022 9:55 PM] tux_linux
Thanks for replying!
Hmm. What would you mean by "handling `ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID` properly"?


[2/6/2022 9:55 PM] ninuje
The H2O has the same quirk: there's no slot 0


[2/6/2022 9:55 PM] ninuje
first contact takes slot 1 instead of 0


[2/6/2022 9:56 PM] tux_linux
So that's the problem


[2/6/2022 9:56 PM] ninuje
Which should be mostly harmless to a sane userland state machine


[2/6/2022 9:57 PM] ninuje
(IIRC, until I hacked around it in KOReader, it basically just ate the firts tap)


[2/6/2022 9:58 PM] tux_linux
Or maybe that could be modified to `0`?


[2/6/2022 9:58 PM] ninuje
As for the build issue, compiler's right, that's a syntax error

👍 

[2/6/2022 10:07 PM] tux_linux
But to work properly, `ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID` should have a value of `-1` at some point, right?


[2/6/2022 10:08 PM] tux_linux
```
 else if (data->code == ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID)
        {
            qCDebug(qLcEvdevTouch) << "EV_ABS TRACKING_ID " << data->value;
            m_currentData.trackingId = data->value;
            if (m_typeB)
            {
                if (m_currentData.trackingId == -1)
                {
                    m_contacts[m_currentSlot].state = Qt::TouchPointReleased;
                    qCDebug(qLcEvdevTouch) << "EV_ABS TRACKING_ID -1 touch point released";
                }
                else
                {
                    m_contacts[m_currentSlot].state = Qt::TouchPointPressed;
                    m_contacts[m_currentSlot].trackingId = m_currentData.trackingId;
                    qCDebug(qLcEvdevTouch) << "EV_ABS TRACKING_ID !-1 touch point pressed";
                }
            }
        }
```
That's what it seems to be in old march commit, `qevdevtouchhandler.cpp`, lines 619-637


[2/6/2022 10:14 PM] ninuje
Yup

`ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID` never becomes `-1`...


[2/6/2022 10:15 PM] ninuje
Because Kobo ;p


[2/6/2022 10:15 PM] ninuje
It never happens on *any* Kobo


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] ninuje
(it should, though)


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] tux_linux
So the QPA relies on something else, I guess?


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] ninuje
So we have to detect contact lifts in other ways


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] ninuje
(usually, a pressure-like event hitting 0)


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] ninuje
Or just doing insane trickery to basically keep track of slots in userland


[2/6/2022 10:16 PM] ninuje
Which is dumb


[2/6/2022 10:17 PM] ninuje
But, oh, well

But Glo HD makes those become `0` and it still doesn't work


[2/6/2022 10:19 PM] ninuje
KOReader uses `ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR` == `0` to fake a lift on those, yeah

N437: Make QT QPA touch input work (finally!) · Kobo-InkBox/kernel@...
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/2ff5ad4af885b79c9b552495532cea9d799b91c8-DA9B5

Ok, Kobo kernels are literal shit.
It does work, but when I try to launch X11, it segfaults everywhere and finally it comes to a general device crash.
I don't doubt it will do that too in other situations within InkBox itself


[2/7/2022 2:24 AM] tux_linux
Well, fine. If it works from time to time, then there must be a way to make it work definitely. I hope it's not some kind of unfixable void that will stay there forever...


[2/7/2022 4:00 AM] tux_linux
Ok, slowly progressing...
When restarting the QPA, I get this, will investigate...

Hello


[2/12/2022 6:50 PM] dr7271
so I have my professor's kobo which is not booting up, I tried flashing the original firmware (.img) file I got on mobilereads but it still doesn't boot up. I tried logging serial messages here they are.

Yes, this is a more appropriate place


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] dr7271
Now after searching I came across your project. Now I would like to port this firmware to AURA HD


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] tux_linux
But we can continue here too


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] tux_linux
oh


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] tux_linux
Model number?


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/12/2022 6:51 PM] dr7271
umm that device was sitting for a while and now it's not booting up


[2/12/2022 6:52 PM] the.mightydill
oh, got it

[2/12/2022 6:52 PM] dr7271
is that a problem?


[2/12/2022 6:52 PM] the.mightydill
nope! just curious


[2/12/2022 6:52 PM] dr7271
I tried win32diskimager


[2/12/2022 6:52 PM] the.mightydill
try balenaEtcher


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] dr7271
but the device is communicating


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] dr7271
I have one question, If this doesn't work, can we port a firmware and try that?


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] tux_linux
For porting InkBox it is *highly* recommended to have a Linux computer/install


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] dr7271
sure doing it riht away.


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] dr7271
I have it man


[2/12/2022 6:53 PM] tux_linux
sure


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] dr7271
I'm into the hardware hacking side


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] tux_linux
The boot logs clearly show this isn't an hard brick


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] the.mightydill
oh, hm. you could also see if the screen is broken. is the light just continuously flashing?


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] dr7271
in ebooks kindles mostly


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] dr7271
screen is not broken


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] the.mightydill

[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] tux_linux
What do you do with them?


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] dr7271
can I screen share?


[2/12/2022 6:54 PM] tux_linux
yes
But a copy-paste of the log would be better


[2/12/2022 6:55 PM] tux_linux
For later consultation


[2/12/2022 6:55 PM] dr7271
I downgraded them and then jailbroke them


[2/12/2022 6:55 PM] dr7271
sure


[2/12/2022 6:55 PM] tux_linux
So you have some Linux knowledge I guess


[2/12/2022 6:55 PM] tux_linux
which is good

nickel problem i guess? reflashing with etcher would be better, just to be sure. nickel shouldn't have a problem but it's always possible

cool


[2/12/2022 6:56 PM] the.mightydill
ah


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
Yeah I also think the same


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
I have one more question


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
should I format the sd card before flashing?


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
and if yes then how


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
btw what's nickle


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] tux_linux
You just flash it


[2/12/2022 6:57 PM] dr7271
okay


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] tux_linux
It overwrites the entire card


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] dr7271
because it caused errors before if I tried without formatting


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] the.mightydill
nickel is the stock firmware


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] dr7271
okayy


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] tux_linux
Did you take the right image for the Aura HD? Not for any other model?


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] dr7271
yeah I requested from mobilereads


[2/12/2022 6:58 PM] dr7271
do you have one which you can give?

[2/12/2022 7:00 PM] tux_linux

Possibilities then are probably corrupted SD card


[2/12/2022 7:00 PM] tux_linux
or permanent hardware damage somehow


[2/12/2022 7:00 PM] dr7271
I tried a different sd card too

If it doesn't work I'll try flashing in ubuntu


[2/12/2022 7:01 PM] dr7271
yeah but battery is full


[2/12/2022 7:01 PM] dr7271

Strange that the kernel doesn't start


[2/12/2022 7:02 PM] dr7271
yeah


[2/12/2022 7:03 PM] the.mightydill
or corrupt download?


[2/12/2022 7:03 PM] dr7271
earlier it used to get stuck at "Starting kernel ... Uncompressing Linux... uncompression error"

oh


[2/12/2022 7:03 PM] dr7271

[2/12/2022 7:03 PM] dr7271

Well, it'll get ported at some point


[2/12/2022 7:40 PM] tux_linux
hopefully


[2/12/2022 7:41 PM] dr7271
I'll do it


[2/12/2022 7:41 PM] tux_linux
I'll create a thread in #porting


[2/12/2022 7:41 PM] dr7271
just need your guidance


[2/12/2022 7:41 PM] tux_linux
You can look at the Libra H2O thread to see how much work it is

It has already been ported, but you need to install it manually. Check out the Libra porting thread for details and feel free to ask questions!

This doesn't mean there are no recovery possibilities


[2/18/2022 1:12 PM] tux_linux
You can trigger download mode within U-Boot or hope it will come up if your wipe the eMMC


[2/18/2022 1:12 PM] szybet
u-boot is on the storage too


[2/18/2022 1:12 PM] szybet
so if we need to update u-boot and it would't work it would be bricked


[2/18/2022 1:13 PM] tux_linux
Yep!

[2/18/2022 1:13 PM] tux_linux

[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] szybet
installing inkbox works by flashing the sd card, but how much storage is the sd card?


[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] tux_linux
Maybe you can short eMMC contacts to trigger download mode too
(Would need @andi opinion on that)


[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] tux_linux
All


[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] szybet
the file has 8Gb, but my kobo nia sd card is 16 Gb


[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] szybet
so i dont think so


[2/18/2022 1:14 PM] tux_linux
Standard InkBox images are for 4G cards


[2/18/2022 1:15 PM] szybet
is it easy to resize it?


[2/18/2022 1:16 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, it's not like Nickel but it's easy


[2/18/2022 1:16 PM] tux_linux
The onboard storage lives in p4/onboard and is a disk image


[2/18/2022 1:17 PM] tux_linux
Maybe you can install the emulator, you'll have a better idea


[2/18/2022 1:19 PM] szybet
good


[2/18/2022 1:20 PM] szybet
how looks installing a new kernel, like 5.*? is it even possible?


[2/18/2022 1:20 PM] tux_linux
The emulator uses 5.15.10


[2/18/2022 1:20 PM] szybet
for the kobo


[2/18/2022 1:20 PM] szybet
psyhical device


[2/18/2022 1:20 PM] tux_linux
But standard devices need vendor kernel or a manually ported mainline kernel


[2/18/2022 1:21 PM] szybet
manually, so only generating the config?


[2/18/2022 1:21 PM] tux_linux
Nothing has been done yet for the Clara


[2/18/2022 1:21 PM] tux_linux
Much, much, much more than that


[2/18/2022 1:21 PM] szybet
not good :(


[2/18/2022 1:22 PM] tux_linux
Creating a DTS, matching the config, adapting the display driver, etc.


[2/18/2022 1:22 PM] szybet
DTS?


[2/18/2022 1:22 PM] szybet
i think point 2 and 3 could be done


[2/18/2022 1:22 PM] tux_linux
Device Tree Source


[2/18/2022 1:23 PM] tux_linux
You can ask @andi , he knows a lot more about it than me


[2/18/2022 1:23 PM] szybet
```The primary purpose of Device Tree in Linux is to provide a way to describe non-discoverable hardware. This information was previously hard coded in source code.```


[2/18/2022 1:24 PM] szybet
could't this be done using the old kernel?


[2/18/2022 1:24 PM] szybet
there isin't new hardware on it


[2/18/2022 1:24 PM] tux_linux
Yes
Vendor kernel has one but maybe it won't work with the newer one


[2/18/2022 1:24 PM] tux_linux
Is your Kobo on 4.1.15?


[2/18/2022 1:24 PM] szybet
there isin't backwards compability?


[2/18/2022 1:25 PM] szybet
yes it is


[2/18/2022 1:25 PM] szybet
and i think there is a bug the usb driver, thats why i want to update


[2/18/2022 1:25 PM] tux_linux
That's not too bad
To give you an idea, some supported InkBox devices run on 2.6.35.3


[2/18/2022 1:25 PM] tux_linux
Patching vendor kernel would probably be easier


[2/18/2022 1:26 PM] szybet
you mean applying git patches?


[2/18/2022 1:26 PM] tux_linux
Well, modifying the code


[2/18/2022 1:26 PM] szybet
that does not sound easy


[2/18/2022 1:27 PM] tux_linux
I did this on the Glo HD to make touch input behave


[2/18/2022 1:27 PM] tux_linux
Then porting mainline yourself is probably the worst nightmare you can have


[2/18/2022 1:27 PM] szybet
i also modified some code that i could compile the kernel

User is `user` and password is `user`
Once you get to the root prompt, start a new shell with `CTRL+SHIFT+T` in gnome-terminal, then do `while true; do vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901; sleep 1; done` and it should come up after some minutes!

Porting to old Kindles would be possible, I just don't have any prior to the PW3 (which serial port is kind of broken).

if a device is not brickable ( like kobos with sd cards ) then there is a green light for it

sorry, i just mash a bunch of random letters when joining discord.  just stopped by to say thanks for developing inkbox and i'm new to ereaders and am looking for something linux friendly.  this project caught my eye.  trying to figure out which kobo to get...looking at a Clara HD.  i see the port is in progress for this device.


[3/8/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
well, maybe you'd be better to get one that is already ported
a Glo HD would be better
(thanks for the review!)


[3/8/2022 4:10 PM] szybet
1 has clara hd a sd card as storage?
2 progress doesn't mean it will ever be done


[3/8/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
We don't know if the Clara HD has some issues similar to the Libra and the Nia, which makes the UI unstable at times


[3/8/2022 4:11 PM] tux_linux
And a Glo HD is basically a Clara HD but from 2015


[3/8/2022 4:11 PM] tux_linux
Same screen ppi, same amount of RAM, and similar CPU


[3/8/2022 4:12 PM] tux_linux
The official image has not been released yet (it will be when 1.9 is) but porting is fully completed for that device


[3/8/2022 4:12 PM] tux_linux
1. Yes
2. We'll see...


[3/8/2022 4:13 PM] sfdsafddfad8661
thanks for the advice.  i'm really just one day into looking at these devices.  i've been partial to real paper books but humble bundle has 31 boss fight ebooks for $18 and i can't turn that down 😉

[3/8/2022 4:46 PM] ninuje
AFAIK, the Clara EPDC quirks are less severe, in that they're mostly limited to rota 0 @ 8bpp, and that's *not* Portrait on that device


[3/8/2022 4:46 PM] ninuje
A Glo HD is *NOT* like a Clara *at all*. Completely different SoC & screen 😉


[3/8/2022 4:46 PM] ninuje
The only similarity is the form factor 😉


[3/8/2022 5:04 PM] tux_linux
Well, I knew about the SoC, but ok, I thought the screen was the same 👍


[3/8/2022 5:05 PM] tux_linux
In practice though, they are quite similar


[3/8/2022 5:06 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, but I'm dreading an UI freeze bug like what happened to the Libra this summer (the QPA would randomly stop printing to the FB for no reason), and it seems to happen on the Nia, so I don't have much hope for the Clara...


[3/8/2022 5:10 PM] ninuje
Wait, the Nia is an actual real device that people actually bought? 😄


[3/8/2022 5:10 PM] ninuje
I've seen like, 2 users since it was released 😄

[3/8/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
this freeze its not the same that on libra, maybe sokmething diffrent


[3/8/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
and i have been using the nia at home for 2 hours now, no freeze


[3/8/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
diffrent books, anything


[3/8/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
the only diffrence is i dont launch apps, like the paint one


[3/8/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
so we will se


[3/8/2022 5:32 PM] tux_linux
Awesome


[3/8/2022 5:32 PM] ninuje
The Libra issues were indeed different (the WAIT_FOR ioctl just timing our for no apparent reason).


[3/8/2022 5:32 PM] ninuje
The EPDC hangs are another matter (check dmesg, it's usually shouting about something at one point).


[3/8/2022 5:33 PM] ninuje
And then some devices just hang, period, on top of that ^^


[3/8/2022 5:33 PM] tux_linux
I think FBInk complains about not being able to trigger a refresh (operation not permitted)


[3/8/2022 5:34 PM] ninuje
Quick successions of refreshes are usually a great way to kill affected kernels/devices (i.e., FBInk's doom demo, or InkVT); and rota 0 @ 8bpp usually exacerbates those because there's less time spent in C-land.


[3/8/2022 5:34 PM] szybet
i saw that the nia has some gpio pins, maybe they are related? maybe the gpio pins controll the e-ink in some way on the libra?


[3/8/2022 5:35 PM] tux_linux
Well, sometimes I was reading a book page, no moving content on the screen and then I wanted to click next and it had hung


[3/8/2022 5:35 PM] ninuje
Since you can both run custom kernels, I'd recommend trying verbose builds w/ the verbose EPDC logging enabled, that might shed some more light on this

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/8/2022 5:35 PM] ninuje
Unless it's like sunxi where enabling verbose logging basically murders the EPDC 😄

{Reactions}
😂 

[3/8/2022 5:36 PM] tux_linux
InkVT actually works well on the Libra with InkBox


[3/8/2022 5:36 PM] tux_linux
It doesn't seem to trigger the kernel bug


[3/8/2022 5:36 PM] ninuje
I don't think I've heard of hangs on the Libra (1, the 2 is a crash-fest, apparently)


[3/8/2022 5:36 PM] ninuje
Just the wait_for timeouts


[3/8/2022 5:37 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/8/2022 5:38 PM] ninuje
`EPERM` is unfortunately what happens when the ioctl handler returns `-1`, a.k.a. '"we were too lazy to implement meaningful return codes on error" ^^


[3/8/2022 5:39 PM] ninuje
(Usually because that's a very early return)


[3/8/2022 5:40 PM] tux_linux
That's fun


[3/8/2022 5:41 PM] tux_linux
I'm thinking that with the Clara HD and 5.16 kernel we might have some luck

@tux-linux what is your qt setup ( toolchain, etc )? you linked https://github.com/Rain92/kobo-qt-setup-scripts and it will propably work, but if not I ask now


[3/12/2022 11:19 PM] szybet
also https://github.com/baskerville/plato has his own implementation for writing to the e-ink. wow


[3/12/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux

Make KOReader and Plato work in InkBox

it makes more sense that making nickel dualboot


[3/21/2022 9:24 PM] tux_linux
It is not the purpose of InkBox


[3/21/2022 9:24 PM] szybet
i dont want, just a better idea


[3/21/2022 9:24 PM] szybet
dualbooting isin't too


[3/21/2022 9:26 PM] tux_linux
The only devices where you can dual boot Nickel and InkBox are the eMMC ones; for a reason, since flashing the entire Nickel firmware back vs swapping out the microSD card is not very practical


[3/21/2022 9:26 PM] tux_linux
And most people won't try InkBox if they can't go back easily afterwards


[3/21/2022 9:26 PM] tux_linux
Which, on standard devices, you can

To everyone, if somehow you happen to stumble on a simple game like this on GH that:
- Is written in C++ w/Qt (no QML);
- Is **not** written in PyQt/PySide2 (Qt bindings for Python);
- Does not have external dependencies;
- Does not seem to be too much hassle to build;
please put your suggestions in this channel!


[3/27/2022 10:56 PM] szybet
maybe a terminal written in QT + keyboard? i cant use the one built in without xorg

doesn't fingerterm fit the bill? (IIRC, that's what the rM peeps are using). (Unless the UI is in QML?)


[3/28/2022 12:55 AM] tux_linux
hmm, yeah. QML is there.

[3/28/2022 12:59 AM] db.qp.db
whats wrong with qml?


[3/28/2022 12:59 AM] db.qp.db
it requires a different qt license?


[3/28/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
no, well, I think it isn't available on the libs that inkbox ship with


[3/28/2022 1:01 AM] tux_linux
or it isn't working

qt-widgets or something


[3/28/2022 1:33 AM] tux_linux
well, it should be in the modules


[3/28/2022 1:33 AM] tux_linux
but it seems it isn't

a clue on this @NiLuJe ?


[3/28/2022 1:47 AM] db.qp.db
epframebuffer is remarkable's library that calls into mxcfb

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/28/2022 1:48 AM] db.qp.db
you need epframebuffer.h and the .so or .a file


[3/28/2022 1:49 AM] db.qp.db
or you can write your own backend / port it using niluje's libraries


[3/28/2022 1:49 AM] db.qp.db
if you are looking at terminal emulators, fingerterm is slow, iirc. it doesn't use DU. yaft does, though


[3/28/2022 1:50 AM] db.qp.db
https://github.com/uobikiemukot/yaft (but you also need to write a backend for it)

Or just plug it into our QPA and make sure it's using DU wherever possible 😉

[3/28/2022 1:59 AM] db.qp.db
yeh, that makes sense


[3/28/2022 1:59 AM] ninuje
The DU bit is easier said than done, since you need to make sure everything involved is pure B&W


[3/28/2022 2:01 AM] db.qp.db
yaft supports it


[3/28/2022 2:01 AM] db.qp.db
at least, timower's port of yaft supports DU on rM


[3/28/2022 2:34 AM] tux_linux
Maybe I could just reuse InkVT

I can send prebuilt binary for you to test with or you can implement from scratch

how do these cases avoid that the magnet doesn't trigger the sensor when the its fully open ( the "flap" is on the back )? i can't figure this out

[4/3/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
Well, the magnet only faces one side, right?


[4/3/2022 11:22 PM] szybet
you mean?


[4/3/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
You never used fridge magnets?


[4/3/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
They are only attractive one one side


[4/3/2022 11:23 PM] szybet
i have never used english a lot


[4/3/2022 11:23 PM] szybet
this is not how a hal sensor works, it works on both sides


[4/3/2022 11:23 PM] szybet
it doest that on the nia


[4/3/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
i'm not talking about the hall sensor


[4/3/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
I'm talking about the magnet itself


[4/3/2022 11:24 PM] szybet
i know, but the hal sensor is triggered by north and south


[4/3/2022 11:25 PM] tux_linux
yes, but maybe the magnet is isolated on one side


[4/3/2022 11:25 PM] szybet
like what isolated?


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
if you put magnet stickers on your fridge, it adheres only one one side, right?


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
i think it's what's happening here


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
here


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
hmm


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
if i turn the magnet its still triggering it


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
oh, you have the case?


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
even if i turn the magnet 90 degrees it still does it


[4/3/2022 11:27 PM] tux_linux
it triggers KEY_F1 anyway?


[4/3/2022 11:28 PM] szybet
i want have made my own


[4/3/2022 11:28 PM] szybet
yes, here is the problem


[4/3/2022 11:28 PM] tux_linux
maybe the case blocks enough of the magnetic field so it works only on one side


[4/3/2022 11:29 PM] szybet
its not thick, i doubt it


[4/3/2022 11:30 PM] tux_linux
i don't know


[4/3/2022 11:31 PM] tux_linux
well, does it trigger any other thing if it's on the other side? (`evtest /dev/input/event0` if it says it's busy, `killall evtest` but you'll probably need to restart to get sleep working again)


[4/3/2022 11:35 PM] szybet
only 
```
Event: time 1649026327.175692, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1649026327.565631, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 59 (KEY_F1), value 1

```


[4/3/2022 11:35 PM] szybet
value 1 is when it detects, 0 when i move the magnet away


[4/3/2022 11:35 PM] tux_linux
then i don't know


[4/3/2022 11:38 PM] szybet
soo can i redesign it for the kobo nia as a setting option that it will:
- *its sleeping*
- value 0 detected
- value 1 ( its on the back )
- value 0 detected
- value 1 detected, the sleep cover is back on the top go to sleep now

this software mod is the only thing i can think of that would work


[4/3/2022 11:38 PM] tux_linux
well, can you test the official case before that?


[4/3/2022 11:39 PM] tux_linux
people are not likely to build their own cases


[4/3/2022 11:39 PM] szybet
its 1/4 the price od the kobo nia, no way ;p


[4/3/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
maybe look up doc online about how to build a case?


[4/3/2022 11:40 PM] tux_linux
like for an ipad, i guess


[4/3/2022 11:40 PM] szybet
1. 3D printing is very popular these days
2. Support for custom cases, which will take up ~2Kb of script code is bad?


[4/3/2022 11:41 PM] tux_linux
will it work for normal cases too?


[4/3/2022 11:41 PM] szybet
normal you mean the official one? idk we need a guy with that case


[4/3/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
well, until we have a guy with that case i won't merge it


[4/3/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
you're welcome to make changes though


[4/3/2022 11:42 PM] szybet
maybe we can ask the second person that is using the kobo nia ;p


[4/3/2022 11:42 PM] tux_linux
is there one here?


[4/3/2022 11:43 PM] szybet
it won't be the default, it will be an if in the script, some code and a config file with false in it :/ i really doesn't want to fork inkbox


[4/3/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
didn't you already fork the rootfs?


[4/3/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
oh


[4/3/2022 11:44 PM] tux_linux
ok


[4/3/2022 11:44 PM] szybet
+ another thing i would want to add are cpu freq goversors, it works ok on the kobo nia, the same thing with an if and condfig file somewhere


[4/3/2022 11:45 PM] szybet
only for making a pull request


[4/3/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux
anyway, this will be for 2.0, I think it will be a LOT of cleanup work to do, either for sleep, Reader engine, UI, file chooser, internals, etc.


[4/3/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux
eta july 2022 ;p


[4/3/2022 11:45 PM] tux_linux
so we have time


[4/3/2022 11:46 PM] szybet
for me its important that it will be in the repo, i make the rootfs itself, the gui bundle in the future too


[4/3/2022 11:47 PM] tux_linux
well there's already a generation script, it's reproducible, on GH: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/gui-bundle
you just need to set up a dev environment

also, wouldn't you want a cover with inkbox logo / text on it ;p?


[4/3/2022 11:48 PM] szybet
this would be great for the community


[4/3/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
you need to specify the location of your build folders named (or symlinked) `build_inkbox`, `build_oobe-inkbox`, etc. and it produces it for you


[4/3/2022 11:48 PM] szybet
everyone can 3d print it


[4/3/2022 11:48 PM] tux_linux
my main goal is to actually get a raspberry pi or banana pi with eink screen running inkbox
then sell it (charge only for hardware + small profit so I can keep motivated)


[4/3/2022 11:50 PM] szybet
hmm... aren't the available e-inks for those devices to low-res?


[4/3/2022 11:50 PM] tux_linux
A complete port for the Banana Pi M2 Zero is already there and working, the only thing missing is the eInk screen
But you can interact with the UI via VNC


[4/3/2022 11:50 PM] tux_linux
they are very expensive


[4/3/2022 11:51 PM] szybet
yea...


[4/3/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
Like, $70US for a 300ppi 6inch screen


[4/3/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
I haven't even got the money to buy one for myself and testing


[4/3/2022 11:51 PM] szybet
the kobo nia is 90$...


[4/3/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
the PCBs are not that expensive I think


[4/3/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
the Banana Pi is like $30 base cost without shipping


[4/3/2022 11:52 PM] tux_linux
and 3D printing the shell is probably like $2-3


[4/3/2022 11:53 PM] szybet
1.5$ i think. 3d printing is cheap


[4/3/2022 11:53 PM] szybet
maybe a patreon / donations would be better for you


[4/3/2022 11:53 PM] tux_linux
i already have liberapay + paypal set up


[4/3/2022 11:54 PM] szybet
a manufacturer that puts inkbox as the default would be a dream


[4/3/2022 11:55 PM] szybet
well for now too less people know about inkbox + its not ready. the average person will like to stay with koreader / plato


[4/3/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
some people make donations, sometimes very high amounts, but then they say "for Kobo Aura H2O support", "for x device support", so I want to respect their wishes and don't use the money for something else (like buying a testing eink screen)


[4/3/2022 11:55 PM] szybet
that makes sense, good


[4/3/2022 11:55 PM] tux_linux
yeah, the fact that it's an entire OS is probably not that nice for them


[4/3/2022 11:56 PM] tux_linux
but now it would be impossible to uncouple InkBox from InkBox OS


[4/3/2022 11:56 PM] szybet
it needs killer features that plato and koreader can't have. kobo nia with audio could be one


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] szybet
it doesn't make sense


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] tux_linux
too many things relying on internal features, named pipes (initrd-fifo, ibxd) and it would have like 10% of the features working


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] tux_linux
before it was like that ;p


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] szybet
inkbox gui isin't that good, and the main feature that its open source, tinker friendly


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] tux_linux
up to inkbox 1.3 I provided Nickel packages


[4/3/2022 11:57 PM] szybet
i know


[4/3/2022 11:58 PM] tux_linux
thanks for destroying my enthusiasm 😂


[4/3/2022 11:58 PM] tux_linux
anyway


[4/3/2022 11:59 PM] tux_linux
Well, I think I did a good job with the design at least


[4/3/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
um sorry but its honest, it needs some work. Compared to plato it works... bad


[4/3/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
yes


[4/3/2022 11:59 PM] szybet
but plato doesn't have games for example, its a match of features here


[4/3/2022 11:59 PM] tux_linux
Well, hehe, I haven't done any degree/study in any field of programming, so you get what you get ;p


[4/4/2022 12:00 AM] szybet
degree / and study in programming are worth nothing, only experience is


[4/4/2022 12:00 AM] szybet
inkbox is going in a good direction, it needs time


[4/4/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
BTW for the kobo nia on inkbox the memory for books is 14.1Gb and on nickel 8Gb


[4/4/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
its another feature you see


[4/4/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
2.0 will probably need a complete overhaul of the reader engine
of the entire reader class
and a lot more contributors for code review, etc.


[4/4/2022 12:01 AM] szybet
well maybe actually 10? still more on the same sd card


[4/4/2022 12:01 AM] tux_linux
how? inkbox takes more space than nickel


[4/4/2022 12:02 AM] szybet
idk


[4/4/2022 12:02 AM] tux_linux
Well, I mean, it could have helped for basic things like that... https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/commit/f683d70f1ce71aaab93e88a20bf998f3d2fae847


[4/4/2022 12:02 AM] szybet
maybe


[4/4/2022 12:03 AM] tux_linux
I was too dumb before to realize that I could just put everyhing in a single var and don't read inkbox_device every time


[4/4/2022 12:03 AM] szybet
its still experience i think


[4/4/2022 12:04 AM] tux_linux
I'm counting on you to stay around and learn Qt ;p


[4/4/2022 12:05 AM] szybet
i'm learning, sanki its on the way


[4/4/2022 12:05 AM] szybet
but learning qt / cpp is PAIN compared to rust


[4/4/2022 12:06 AM] tux_linux
for me it came very progressively
first I had no idea whatever signal/slots were
then I spent months trying to figure out how to properly use them
then I started to learn what `QSomeThing * someThing` really does, `->` vs `.`, etc.
namespaces, QTimers, etc.


[4/4/2022 12:08 AM] tux_linux
A bad thing I kind of don't like about Qt is the fact that it reimplements almost all of the C++ standard library
So when you get to work with real C++ it's like you don't understand anything
No QStrings, no QTimers, no `toStdString()`, no `QString::number()`...


[4/4/2022 12:09 AM] tux_linux
Yet, I still don't understand people who choose to write in PyQt
Like, literally, how to make your program slow


[4/4/2022 12:12 AM] tux_linux
Also, it would nice to convert settings to an sqlite database
but that is also going to be 2.0+


[4/4/2022 12:14 AM] szybet
i was trying yestarday to use QDialog. it took me 4 hours to figure its out, lack of documentation and examples ;/


[4/4/2022 12:15 AM] tux_linux
i would create another class with an ui file


[4/4/2022 12:15 AM] tux_linux
much simpler


[4/4/2022 12:15 AM] szybet
Qt without gui is very similar to rust, very similar


[4/4/2022 12:15 AM] szybet
i did it


[4/4/2022 12:15 AM] tux_linux
maybe look in inkbox code?


[4/4/2022 12:16 AM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/master/brightnessdialog.cpp
That is probably a good example, not too hard to understand


[4/4/2022 12:16 AM] szybet
Python has it pluses, but yea performance


[4/4/2022 12:16 AM] szybet
its hard to find what i look for


[4/4/2022 12:16 AM] tux_linux
what are you looking for?


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] szybet
I know this, i needed the part when i get the value from the QDialog


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] szybet
i already got it


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] szybet
PLS not sql, json is better


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] tux_linux
then why do you use sql in sanki?


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] szybet
i need to, anki decks use it


[4/4/2022 12:17 AM] tux_linux
maybe json
i don't know
but I like sql


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
i would really want json for it


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
but yea i dint't decide it for anki


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] tux_linux
I would use inline variables if you want to get a value from another class


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
its your decision, i hate it ;p


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] tux_linux
check https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/master/functions.h, beginning of the file


[4/4/2022 12:18 AM] szybet
i dont understand a single word :D


[4/4/2022 12:19 AM] szybet
`namespace` a new thing for m


[4/4/2022 12:19 AM] tux_linux
basically, you include a common header, you call the variable from a namespace, e.g. `global::something` and you can get the variable value from any class


[4/4/2022 12:20 AM] tux_linux
like the `global::deviceID` variable


[4/4/2022 12:20 AM] szybet
what if i need a variable before launching a widget?


[4/4/2022 12:20 AM] szybet
and its not there


[4/4/2022 12:21 AM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[4/4/2022 12:22 AM] szybet
how to explain this... i cant launch a widget where it reads a sql database if i need to choose before it the file


[4/4/2022 12:22 AM] szybet
thats what i used Qdialog in short


[4/4/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
`connect(dialog, this, SIGNAL(destroyed(QObject*)), SLOT(openSQLDatabase()));`


[4/4/2022 12:24 AM] tux_linux
Then `openSQLDatabase()` reads an inline variable (like `global::sqlDBPath`) when the QDialog is closed/destroyed and after it has set the `global::sqlDBPath` based on the user selection


[4/4/2022 12:25 AM] tux_linux
Also, did you `dialog->setAttribute(Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose);` on your dialog? Otherwise it may memory leak


[4/4/2022 12:26 AM] szybet
no


[4/4/2022 12:26 AM] tux_linux
Basically, it will delete the class from memory once the dialog is closed


[4/4/2022 12:26 AM] tux_linux
e.g., when you call `this->close()`


[4/4/2022 12:26 AM] szybet
i did this in a similar way... hmm


[4/4/2022 12:27 AM] szybet
i call ui->accept() i think?


[4/4/2022 12:28 AM] tux_linux
where?


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] szybet
in the cpp file


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] tux_linux
Also, advice: everything you create and use an object with `QSomething * someThing` and it uses `->`, call `something->deleteLater()` when you're finished with it otherwise it will memory leak too


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] tux_linux
...which?


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] szybet
choosemode.cpp


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] szybet
modechoose.cpp


[4/4/2022 12:29 AM] szybet
somethink like that


[4/4/2022 12:30 AM] szybet

its actually done()


[4/4/2022 12:31 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
you should call `this->close()` instead


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] szybet
it returns the value to mainwindow


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
And do that


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] szybet
i want to return the value, and i think close() is called with it


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
oh yeah ok


[4/4/2022 12:32 AM] tux_linux
then add this->close separately


[4/4/2022 12:33 AM] szybet
instead if connect i did this: https://github.com/Szybet/sanki/blob/4cf6bc400fd3f33907656c0ae91f97a169392f5f/mainwindow.cpp#L61

[4/4/2022 12:33 AM] szybet
?


[4/4/2022 12:33 AM] tux_linux
i mean, it's ok too i think


[4/4/2022 12:34 AM] tux_linux
also, in Qt/CPP the 'norm' is to use camelCase, not snake_case for variable/classes names
but it's a personal preference


[4/4/2022 12:35 AM] szybet
i use it for UI things, i will need to standarise it to one


[4/4/2022 12:36 AM] tux_linux
initially I used snake case in InkBox, but since this summer it's only camel case


[4/4/2022 12:37 AM] szybet
has inkbox a logo?


[4/4/2022 12:37 AM] tux_linux

Nooo


[4/4/2022 1:42 PM] tux_linux
Yeah I know, it was just missing the stylesheet


[4/6/2022 1:10 AM] tux_linux
@NiLuJe is there something I'm missing here? Whenever I want to put a device to sleep (mk5, mk6, mk7, all of them), even if I `echo 1 > /sys/power/state-extended` and wait 60 seconds in-between before `echo mem > /sys/power/state` just to be sure, touching the screen still wakes up the device. Also, on the Libra, the gyro wakes it too if the physical position/orientation has changed.
I have no clue. I feel like Kobo is not using the same kernel sources as the ones they provided us, because this makes no sense...


[4/6/2022 1:11 AM] tux_linux
Meanwhile, I'll give up for now unless a miracle happens. It will go in 1.9 release, but what do you want, it's like dark magic. Kobo/Netronix kernels have already given me enough brain damage...


[4/6/2022 1:13 AM] tux_linux
Only @Szybet got it to work on his Nia with this commit https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/commit/f215114774b8e85c3feb1f36afc13392bb52e2d2
I tried doing the same with my Glo HD, but it's zForce touch, I didn't get any luck with that...


[4/6/2022 1:16 AM] ninuje
The sources being outdated are definitely an issue in general, possibly not really here though, but it works on stock kernels ;o).


[4/6/2022 1:16 AM] ninuje
So short of testing on a stock kernel, no clue.

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/6/2022 1:17 AM] ninuje
Ought to be tested in a void, too (i.e., absolutely nothing running but a dumb script that tests this).


[4/6/2022 1:18 AM] tux_linux
Ok, thanks anyway...
Though the Libra kernel that was updated this summer was "positioned for the future" as gtalusan said in the commit's comments


[4/6/2022 1:18 AM] ninuje
That FW is out by now (and... A newer build since, too).


[4/6/2022 1:18 AM] tux_linux
The worst thing is that I got it working in interactive mode, maybe just a coincidence...
It never works via script though


[4/6/2022 1:19 AM] ninuje
But the changes are mostly related to usb, IIRC.

{Reactions}
👍 

[4/6/2022 1:20 AM] tux_linux
Quite strange that literally almost all of my devices (haven't tested the Touch yet) trigger the problem


[4/6/2022 1:20 AM] ninuje
It's the same framework since basically forever.


[4/6/2022 1:20 AM] tux_linux
But different touch screens


[4/6/2022 1:20 AM] ninuje
The sysfs file sets a kernel global that ntx patches all over the place.

[4/6/2022 1:22 AM] ninuje
I've only seen races on the other end on stock kernels (old neonode builds sometimes failing to wake on resume).


[4/6/2022 1:23 AM] ninuje
That probably means you're doing it wrong, tbh.

I have some ideas to check, wait for the weekend I will look to it


[4/6/2022 1:29 AM] szybet
The thing that helped me search for the solution were "Linux interfupts" they are mentioned as irq in the source


[4/6/2022 1:29 AM] tux_linux
I can't wait
I just want to publish 1.9 and be done with it...


[4/6/2022 1:29 AM] szybet
I said what you can try out already


[4/6/2022 1:30 AM] tux_linux
The last thing I will test will be to revert to an old rootfs commit where Wi-Fi reconnection didn't exist and see if that is the problem


[4/6/2022 1:30 AM] tux_linux
I did


[4/6/2022 1:30 AM] szybet
I will tomorrow say what you can edit in the source file exactly


[4/6/2022 1:30 AM] szybet
Everything?


[4/6/2022 1:31 AM] tux_linux
Well, I investigated the code, blanked out the suspend and resume functions of the touch screen driver, so like, what can be left to do?


[4/6/2022 1:31 AM] tux_linux
I literally wiped out the part where it (is supposed to) send the resume command
And yet it still resumes


[4/6/2022 1:35 AM] szybet
Here are my ideas: 
1 Disable only "wake up disable irq" lines
2 Disable only "wake up enable irq" Lines
3 with 1 but put wake enable irq at some place in file where it will be executed. Maybe the default is enable, and disable never happens
4 but with 2 etc
5 look for other files / drivers
6 what was the result with:
- compile as module
- wake up interface disable
- binding the driver
- roving the i2c device?

+ look at other irq something in the source code. Interrupt are important. I think kobo uses them for wakeups


[4/6/2022 1:38 AM] szybet
Idk, maybe something more. Change the voltage of the regulator that powers it


[4/6/2022 1:39 AM] tux_linux
At this point, if it doesn't work on all devices, I can't believe it's due to the kernel
In July it will be one year since I implemented the mem sleep framework; I can't believe I let that pass for a so long time, it must have broke because of some nonsensical bug in the rootfs


[4/6/2022 1:40 AM] szybet
Idk what you are talking about


[4/6/2022 1:40 AM] tux_linux
Since we implemented Wi-Fi reconnection


[4/6/2022 1:40 AM] tux_linux
I think that's where it broke


[4/6/2022 1:40 AM] tux_linux
For some unknown reason


[4/6/2022 2:39 AM] ninuje
Can't sleep with wifi loaded


[4/6/2022 2:39 AM] ninuje
FWIW


[4/6/2022 2:41 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, I know, we handle that


[4/6/2022 2:41 AM] tux_linux
See
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/sleep_standby.sh and https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/wake_standby.sh


[4/6/2022 2:43 AM] ninuje
sleep(2) between state-extended and state


[4/6/2022 2:43 AM] ninuje
(because reasons)


[4/6/2022 2:43 AM] ninuje
The 10s beforehand are useless, on the other hand


[4/6/2022 2:43 AM] tux_linux
I tried that too


[4/6/2022 2:43 AM] tux_linux
well, if they aren't there it says 'failure to suspend some devices' and aborts


[4/6/2022 2:44 AM] ninuje
That's because you're doing a whole bunch of crap before, then ^^


[4/6/2022 2:44 AM] ninuje
(e.g., fbink)


[4/6/2022 2:44 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, I display a "Sleeping" splash


[4/6/2022 2:45 AM] ninuje
Yeah, makes sense, although it's a little weird to bunch it in there.


[4/6/2022 2:45 AM] tux_linux
Where would you put it? Qt isn't aware of when the device goes to sleep


[4/6/2022 2:46 AM] ninuje
The idea is to: stop handling input in the GUI, stop stuff, display sleepy time, kill wifi. Then shcedule said script to run in ~15s.


[4/6/2022 2:46 AM] ninuje
Making the script itself sleep is somewhat less elegant 😉


[4/6/2022 2:47 AM] ninuje
and confusing because it's unrelated to the actual delays needed because of kernel fuckery


[4/6/2022 2:48 AM] tux_linux
But then, how in the world does it work when you launch the service from shell?


[4/6/2022 2:49 AM] ninuje
you're not using the GUI ;p


[4/6/2022 2:49 AM] ninuje
(draining the evdev queue before sleep might be necessary, too)


[4/6/2022 2:50 AM] ninuje
(it's also good practice to avoid further fuckery with sleep covers)


[4/6/2022 2:50 AM] tux_linux
yeah, but I trigger sleep from the power button, I never do anything with the GUI
besides, the GUI was running when I launched it from shell


[4/6/2022 2:50 AM] tux_linux
I have given up on sleep covers since a long time ...


[4/6/2022 2:52 AM] ninuje
Power button is an evdev key event 😉 (also, run stuff on key release, not key press)


[4/6/2022 2:52 AM] ninuje
(with a debounce protection)


[4/6/2022 2:52 AM] tux_linux
Maybe I'll have to use some crazy command like this one, launching it without this specific sh sequence didn't work at all: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/6d1f907279c1ba64977c17891f4d2b6c379b865a/etc/init.d/ibxd#L136-L138


[4/6/2022 2:53 AM] tux_linux
Sure, but when it ran from shell I used the power button too


[4/6/2022 2:53 AM] ninuje
:?


[4/6/2022 2:54 AM] tux_linux
Detecting power button events is a dumb evtest watch, I should probably change that somehow: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/evtest_watch


[4/6/2022 2:55 AM] ninuje
:?!


[4/6/2022 2:55 AM] ninuje
(WHy?!)


[4/6/2022 2:56 AM] ninuje
It's a standard EV_KEY, let Qt deal with it?


[4/6/2022 2:56 AM] tux_linux
because... this dates back to march 2021 when I was starting with shell scripts and all


[4/6/2022 2:56 AM] tux_linux
I doubt it is related to the problem though


[4/6/2022 2:57 AM] ninuje
If there's *one* thing on Kobo that spits out sane event streams, it's event0 ;o)


[4/6/2022 2:57 AM] tux_linux
Yeah, but Qt is down when X11/KoBox is running


[4/6/2022 2:58 AM] ninuje
Then write an actual power management daemon ;o)


[4/6/2022 2:58 AM] tux_linux
lots of fun ahead...


[4/6/2022 2:58 AM] ninuje
Because this feels like a series of hacks piled up over each other. You're never going to be able to untangle all this without going back to the basics


[4/6/2022 2:58 AM] tux_linux
i know


[4/6/2022 3:00 AM] tux_linux
you're right, this will be on the todo list for 2.0


[4/6/2022 3:01 AM] tux_linux
write it in c++ or some language that makes sense for this


[4/6/2022 3:35 AM] ninuje
LifeHack: just periodically go back to sleep until you eat an actual meaningful wakeup event (i.e., Power/SleepCover key release)


[4/6/2022 3:35 AM] ninuje
Also, differentiate between touch events *before* suspend that prevent it because EBUSY, from touch events *after* suspend that wakes up because wakeup pins + state-extended 0 😉

Seems that just before suspending, the Glo HD resets state-extended to 0...
Nonsense


[4/6/2022 6:59 AM] tux_linux
IT WORKS!
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/commit/e260f2b7bd4c24c016c6c9ca42dc5f70c7a2dba5
That was really like a rabbit hole to go through; even to understand what those few lines are doing
Something was writing 0 to `state-extended`, I don't know what thing, but now mode 0 is invoked by `echo 2 > /sys/power/state-extended` instead. `echo 1` works as usual and doesn't trigger any issues, the screen doesn't react to touch when sleeping, that's wonderful.
Thanks @NiLuJe and @Szybet  for the suggestions!

[4/6/2022 1:43 PM] tux_linux
Well, according to a while loop, something wrote 0 to state-extended some milliseconds before it went to mem sleep (no idea at all what it is). It explains why the touchscreen reacted and woke up the device.
So now if it writes 0, it triggers nothing, it needs to write 2 to reproduce what 0 did.
So I can set it to 1 and don't worry about it anymore.


[4/6/2022 3:16 PM] szybet
Will it work for every device?


[4/6/2022 3:17 PM] szybet
+ if a device triggers wake up, it will propably also write 0 to extended


[4/6/2022 4:58 PM] tux_linux
We will see


[4/6/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
I don't know, I tested it quite heavily on my Glo HD, it works fine


[4/6/2022 5:00 PM] tux_linux
I will not edit anything in the Nia source for now


[4/6/2022 5:28 PM] tux_linux
No way
2048 literally makes the device short circuit on the Glo HD
This is hilarious


[4/6/2022 5:29 PM] tux_linux
It's only temporary, reboot works fine


[4/6/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
Short circuit?


[4/6/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
Whaaaat


[4/6/2022 5:40 PM] szybet
Could you explain the changes?


[4/6/2022 5:41 PM] szybet
And does it go to sleep when the screen is touched before echo mem state?


[4/6/2022 6:33 PM] tux_linux
Explanation


[4/6/2022 6:33 PM] tux_linux
No it doesn't


[4/6/2022 6:35 PM] tux_linux
It shuts off


[4/6/2022 6:36 PM] tux_linux
Like if it powered down


[4/6/2022 6:55 PM] szybet
CPU overheat?


[4/6/2022 6:55 PM] szybet
But the code


[4/6/2022 6:56 PM] szybet
So its the same lukę on the nią?


[4/6/2022 6:56 PM] szybet
To much power draw?


[4/6/2022 7:02 PM] tux_linux
The code does exactly what I said


[4/6/2022 7:02 PM] tux_linux
No, probably incorrect writes in the EPDC that make it freak out
It's very strange


[4/6/2022 7:43 PM] ninuje
Nothing in the kernel ever writes to `gSleep_Mode_Suspend` (except the sysfs attribute write handler)


[4/6/2022 7:44 PM] ninuje
And being able to set it to 0 is extremely useful (when resuming, for one), but also when suspend fails


[4/6/2022 7:44 PM] ninuje
(i.e., we're back to: not a kernel issue)


[4/6/2022 10:38 PM] tux_linux
In this case, I only have to set it to 2 instead


[4/6/2022 10:40 PM] tux_linux
I don't doubt that, but I was unable to find what it was in my rootfs. Maybe udev for some reason, since it doesn't happen in the initrd.


[4/6/2022 11:51 PM] tux_linux
I don't set it to 0 or 2 after resuming, but the touchscreen works as well as another sleep/wake cycle. Normal?

Evening all from the UK. Just here to read and learn on developments. I was given a Kobo Glo for my daughter. So just checking what it can run software and os wise. Good work on inkbox btw


[4/10/2022 6:59 PM] tux_linux
You installed it? Nice!


[4/10/2022 7:00 PM] szybet
it can run everything, it only depends on your willingness to do it


[4/10/2022 7:00 PM] szybet
well, e-ink display and the cpu is a limitation


[4/10/2022 7:01 PM] szybet
but still


[4/10/2022 7:01 PM] drfunkenbreakz
Yeah it's really good. Only issue i found was if i go into calculator or one of the other "apps", i couldn't figure out how to exit the app with no back, exit or physical hard keys on the glo.


[4/10/2022 7:01 PM] tux_linux
yeah, sorry


[4/10/2022 7:01 PM] tux_linux
Are you on the latest version?

[4/10/2022 7:04 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/10/2022 7:04 PM] tux_linux
1.9 will be out soon

[4/10/2022 7:11 PM] tux_linux
But I mean, like, people actually putting on their ereader for reading, assuming that it will be adequate and up to their expectations


[4/10/2022 7:12 PM] tux_linux
Like they would do with koreader/plato/etc


[4/10/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
yes, im actually suprised that its usable for them without the latest fixes


[4/10/2022 7:12 PM] tux_linux
The Glo was one of the first supported models, since July 2021 in 1.5


[4/10/2022 7:13 PM] tux_linux
So it was heavily tested on that device


[4/10/2022 7:13 PM] szybet
yes, but pdf to epub, global reading settings, etc are bugs for all devices?


[4/10/2022 7:13 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/10/2022 7:14 PM] tux_linux
but they only happen when you trigger them
@DrFunkenbreakz probably just hasn't encountered any of these situations yet ;p

inkbox is  buggy right now, so be patient


[4/10/2022 7:15 PM] tux_linux

I did compile okreader (koreader on debian) and stuck it on a sdcard. It worked ok, but sadly development ended back in 2019. The later versions of koreader need more adjustments due to age of debian being used and some missing dependencies

it works fine alongside nickel

InkBox OS 1.5
InkBox OS is a complete operating system replacement for Kobo eReader devices. It currently runs on the Glo, Touch and Mini models. It is built around Qt 5.15.2 and namely features ePUB rendering. Along that, full KoBox/X11 support is integrated, allowing the user to run X apps natively on the device.
InkBox OS is built around a core concept: se...

That's a wrapper around the "activity" bar (e.g., a spinner), but there's a standard progress bar, too.

😆


[4/10/2022 7:58 PM] tux_linux
no way I missed this

That was a requirement for MRPI, so I'm pretty sure it was in 1.0, possibly even earlier ;p


[4/10/2022 8:00 PM] tux_linux
ooh that's what you're talking about


[4/10/2022 8:00 PM] tux_linux
I think I saw it once but didn't like it


[4/10/2022 8:00 PM] ninuje
It is very shamelessly designed after the Nickel "import" progress bar ;p


[4/10/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
It didn't quite follow the design language


[4/10/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
It's the one used when byte-compiling python?


[4/10/2022 8:01 PM] ninuje
Yeah


[4/10/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, good but more-or-less a good fit for my purpose


[4/10/2022 8:01 PM] tux_linux
no offense ;p


[4/10/2022 8:02 PM] ninuje
None taken, designing a custom one is fairly easy with fbink_cls nowadays 😉


[4/10/2022 8:02 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, I had issues with some devices, I needed to invert with `-H` or it would print strangely


[4/10/2022 8:02 PM] tux_linux
like that https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/f3d5e858b3e60793bde1fce9bc82b7aab0a9e514/initrd/common/inkbox-splash#L51


[4/10/2022 8:04 PM] tux_linux
Also when X11 starts on newer devices than imx507/8 the progress bar is "eaten" by whatever X11 is doing and it just doesn't display anything when at 90%+


[4/10/2022 8:06 PM] ninuje
I'd batch the border + fill rects and do a manual refresh for the full region later, that would at least limit concurrency inside the bar drawing itself


[4/10/2022 8:06 PM] ninuje
(won't work on sunxi, though, but that's another kettle of fish)


[4/10/2022 8:07 PM] tux_linux
But if I batch the calls to fill the rectangle, it would just print it full all at once... no?


[4/10/2022 8:08 PM] ninuje
Actually, if the bar never go backwards and the design is simple enough, you'll only need to batch the first tick, since succeeding ticks will only touch the fill bar


[4/10/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
isn't that what it already does?


[4/10/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
the `BOUNDARY_DRAWING_DONE` variable should account for that bit


[4/10/2022 8:09 PM] ninuje
batched (draw border + draw fill + [draw %]) -> refresh


[4/10/2022 8:09 PM] tux_linux
oh, so draw the border every time


[4/10/2022 8:09 PM] ninuje
Or not, depending on the design ^^


[4/10/2022 8:10 PM] tux_linux
I wouldn't mind that, but I'm wondering if it would not actually make things worse by calling even more the EPDC


[4/10/2022 8:10 PM] ninuje
That's the whole point of batching


[4/10/2022 8:11 PM] ninuje
only doing a single refresh


[4/10/2022 8:11 PM] tux_linux
hmm
ok


[4/10/2022 8:11 PM] ninuje
c.f., `-b, --norefresh`


[4/10/2022 8:11 PM] tux_linux
aah


[4/10/2022 8:12 PM] ninuje
You can even micro-optimize it by only refreshing the previous fill pos -> new fill pos rectangle


[4/10/2022 8:12 PM] ninuje
But that's mostly what will happen in practice automatically unless you use GC16 😉


[4/10/2022 8:12 PM] tux_linux
so... remove gc16?


[4/10/2022 8:13 PM] ninuje
Which you really shouldn't for a progress bar ;p


[4/10/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
I put it because it was in the rectangle drawing example


[4/10/2022 8:13 PM] tux_linux
But yeah, ok


[4/10/2022 8:14 PM] ninuje
While DU/A2 would be optimal, remember you can't use it if there's gray levels involved (and that involves what's on screen *behind* the bar the first time you refresh it)


[4/10/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
There's nothing
or it is something I don't know lol


[4/10/2022 8:14 PM] tux_linux
There won't be any gray levels there, so good


[4/10/2022 8:15 PM] tux_linux
A2 won't work on older devices, or am I mistaken?


[4/10/2022 8:15 PM] ninuje
It's there on Mk. 5


[4/10/2022 8:15 PM] ninuje
Possibly earlier, can't recall


[4/10/2022 8:15 PM] tux_linux
I have a Touch B, should be Mk 4


[4/10/2022 8:16 PM] ninuje
But if there's concurrent refreshes, A2 isn't necessarily a good idea

xboard is using better chess engines than ai-chess

Unfortunately that would dry out eventually. Wonder if that magnetic putty would work good says it doesn't dry out.

Quicksilver - Magnetic Thinking Putty
Commonly known as quicksilver, mercury is the only metallic element that is a liquid at room temperature. It’s a heavy, silver-colored metal that has been historically used for temperature gauges and electrical applications because of its conductive properties. Just like its namesake, Quicksilver Thinking Putty® is a s

[4/27/2022 4:05 PM] nonasuomy
why would you talk about mercury...


[4/27/2022 4:05 PM] nonasuomy
You want to associate your product with a toxic substance?


[4/27/2022 4:13 PM] nonasuomy
With these non through-hole probe points they are really meant for pogo pins. If you solder stuff to them you are at risk of ripping the pad off the board. Just the same as you risk shorting out something in a non permanent method of holding the wire there. For both methods just put the device some place safe that won't get knocked around and it will be fine. Even remote into the device that's plugged into it so you don't have to be near it 😄


[4/27/2022 4:14 PM] nonasuomy
You could also put kapton tape around the probs so they don't touch anything else.


[4/27/2022 4:22 PM] nonasuomy
My boards probe points also lay flush with this cast surface. With like 0.1mm gap tolerance. If I put anything on those pads and don’t clean them off properly I’m at risk of the IR touch sensors not aligning properly or the board shorting out.


[4/27/2022 4:24 PM] nonasuomy
I would have to have some super thin magnetic wire to get that working with solder proper.

It really doesn't. Everyone just tries to make a walled garden to dig out a niche. Instead of collaborating. Then you have multiple organizations spinning their tires creating more eWaste. Reinventing the wheel multiple times. Instead of just focusing on making one really great solid base.

As I remember: basically you use the usb2serial on the board (and "bypass" the chip). You can do it removing the chip or coding "something something" which I do not recall.

You may want to consider changing your git repo to just Inkbox instead of kobo-inkbox to prevent confusion if you keep porting endless devices 🙂


[5/8/2022 4:41 AM] tux_linux
i can't
it was already taken

The last time it was used was 2013 for basically nothing. Message GitHub to recover it for you!

[5/9/2022 6:48 PM] raycast_
No


[5/9/2022 6:49 PM] raycast_
128gb was rated as U3


[5/9/2022 6:50 PM] raycast_
64gb was rated as U1 A1 class 10


[5/9/2022 7:09 PM] nonasuomy
Apparently U1 = 10MB/s U3 = 30MB/s


[5/9/2022 7:10 PM] nonasuomy
The internal device controller though would also have to support that.


[5/9/2022 7:42 PM] raycast_
Getting around 64mb/s with U3 (using a cheap USB 3.0 card reader)


[5/9/2022 7:42 PM] raycast_
U1 seems to be limited to around 34mb/s

[5/9/2022 9:03 PM] nonasuomy
"UHS is a definition of the bus the card uses, not the speed of the card directly. However, the speed is going to be at least partly dependent on the bus-type used."


[5/9/2022 9:04 PM] nonasuomy
"So, that’s all a bit confusing in itself, but even the specifications for the individual UHS types are a bit hard to grasp sometimes. The UHS-I definition is a bit... nebulous. Originally it was a 100mhz bus at 50MB/s peak, but now it has provisions for a faster bus allowing up to 104 MB/s. But really, the best way to think of it is that UHS-I just means whatever max speed they can pull most recently from the standard microSD pin layout."


[5/9/2022 9:05 PM] nonasuomy
"UHS-II, defined in 2011, has a different physical pin layout compared to UHS-I. The extra row of pins increases the available bandwidth to 150-300ish MB/s. To be able to use a UHS-II card to its fullest, you’ll need a reader or device that has the extra pins and corresponding bus. Right now no phones have that, and some users have actually reported slower speeds with UHS-II cards in UHS-I devices compared to UHS-I cards."


[5/9/2022 9:05 PM] nonasuomy
"UHS-III is pin-compatible with UHS-II, but with double the bus speeds compared to UHS-II, so a theoretical max somewhere in the range of 300-600MB/s."

I've never bought any SD cards yet with a double row of pins

its hard to port things


[5/27/2022 8:48 PM] szybet
but nothing is impossible


[5/27/2022 10:38 PM] tux_linux
It is already ported
Only difficult to install


[5/27/2022 10:39 PM] tux_linux
And risky too


[5/27/2022 10:39 PM] raycast_

you can contribute and help to not make it risky

isint there a download mode?


[5/27/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
yes


[5/27/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
yes and no


[5/27/2022 11:16 PM] tux_linux
there's no (known) way to trigger it unless you blank the MMC/U-Boot
well, yes, there are `mw` commands in U-Boot to trigger it, but it isn't useful at all in this case


[5/27/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
and it has been tested on only one board, not mine


[5/27/2022 11:17 PM] szybet
you mean?...


[5/27/2022 11:17 PM] szybet
blank?


[5/27/2022 11:17 PM] tux_linux
yes


[5/27/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
andi1 did `cat /dev/zero > /dev/mmcblk0` and download mode was triggered on reboot


[5/27/2022 11:18 PM] tux_linux
I don't know if it triggers it if it can't find U-Boot or if it is something else


[5/27/2022 11:19 PM] szybet
what if on the beggining there was 111 not 000?


[5/27/2022 11:19 PM] szybet
or a corupted u-boot?


[5/27/2022 11:19 PM] tux_linux
we don't know


[5/27/2022 11:19 PM] tux_linux
maybe @andi has more insight


[5/27/2022 11:19 PM] szybet
and the chip IC is?


[5/27/2022 11:20 PM] szybet
serial code


[5/27/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
can't tell you right now
it's an imx6sll


[5/27/2022 11:21 PM] szybet
the solid state memory chip


[5/27/2022 11:21 PM] szybet
not cpu


[5/27/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
oh


[5/27/2022 11:21 PM] tux_linux
iirc it's some samsung thingy


[5/27/2022 11:22 PM] szybet
if there is a download mode then you can read it from the datasheet


[5/27/2022 11:22 PM] szybet
samsung should have it


[5/27/2022 11:22 PM] tux_linux
download mode isn't implemented in the cpu?


[5/27/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
you don't need an emmc to have a download mode


[5/27/2022 11:23 PM] tux_linux
in our case, the "download mode" will only be able to load a working U-Boot to RAM from USB


[5/27/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
With U-Boot we can then do everything, so this is great


[5/27/2022 11:24 PM] szybet
it could. i dont see a problem that the chip itself couldnt have one


[5/27/2022 11:24 PM] szybet
but if so - then the cpu datasheet


[5/27/2022 11:24 PM] tux_linux
at least sunxi download mode (FEL mode) is implemented directly in SoC/CPU


[5/27/2022 11:25 PM] szybet
interestingly datasheets available on the internet are nothing worth


[5/27/2022 11:25 PM] szybet

I use it in my Lichee Pi Zero for a serial board
all is loaded from USB: U-Boot, kernel, initrd, minicom, picocom, microcom, g_ether, etc. so there is no need for any SD card


[5/27/2022 11:29 PM] szybet
this board has so much potential and you use it to read serial

Hello, thanks for the welcome. I usually avoid Discord, but I wanted to thank you for your project! I love that Kobo is going open source thanks to you! Once I pass my final exams, I want to install InkBox on my Kobo Glo HD and my brother's Kobo Glo! But I have a question. Are manga (comics) supported natively or do I need to install an extension like UltimateMangaReader?


[5/29/2022 2:20 PM] tux_linux
If your mangas are in pdf, then yes


[5/29/2022 2:21 PM] szybet
you can install UltimateMangaReader if you want too


[5/29/2022 2:21 PM] raycast_
Use kindlecomicconverter to make epubs if your mangas are PNG files


[5/29/2022 2:22 PM] koboglohduser5419
The manga would be in cbz format. But it would be no problem for me to convert the manga to a PDF. ^^


[5/29/2022 2:22 PM] koboglohduser5419
Thank you, I will do it :D


[5/29/2022 2:23 PM] raycast_
Cbz is just a zip file if I remember correctly


[5/29/2022 2:23 PM] koboglohduser5419
Yes


[5/29/2022 2:24 PM] szybet
inkbox has user apps coming soon, so porting it and launching will be a no problem


[5/29/2022 2:25 PM] koboglohduser5419
Looking forward to installing InkBox soon ^^ Would a faster SD card offer any advantages over the original SD card?


[5/29/2022 2:25 PM] koboglohduser5419
Nice :D


[5/29/2022 2:26 PM] szybet
if you have a faster sd card, yes sure. but buing one specially for inkbox is not worth it


[5/29/2022 2:26 PM] szybet
remember to do a backup of you built in sd card before doing anything


[5/29/2022 2:29 PM] koboglohduser5419
Great, then I will definitely use a faster SD. Because I need more memory for my manga and the SD card is slow to load my mangas on the original system


[5/29/2022 3:04 PM] koboglohduser5419
Many Thanks! I just tried it out and I'm thrilled! I can finally read my manga from right to left! ^^ And the picture quality is much better :)

yes


[6/13/2022 12:21 AM] tux_linux
do you have an rpi? arduino?

do you know how to set up a serial connection from your arduino?


[6/13/2022 12:21 AM] commutativity
i do not


[6/13/2022 12:22 AM] tux_linux
you will need to open your Kobo


[6/13/2022 12:22 AM] tux_linux
there are three ports you need to connect:
```
Kobo Tx -> Arduino Rx
Kobo Rx -> Arduino Tx
Kobo GND -> Arduino GND
```


[6/13/2022 12:23 AM] commutativity
seems simple enough


[6/13/2022 12:23 AM] commutativity
do i just use a credit card?


[6/13/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
Might need a precision knife first
After that you can use a credit card


[6/13/2022 12:23 AM] tux_linux
Do not apply to much pressure, it can damage the screen


[6/13/2022 12:24 AM] tux_linux
Less if it's on the edges like in that case, but not if you are putting pressure on the back or on the main screen

We are dealing with an eMMC, a different SoC and a completely different framebuffer API
Do you really, really, really want to port it? It will be hard
But it is possible


[6/14/2022 11:07 PM] djhardrich
I’ve got NiLuJe’s kobo toolchain up and running, and did a -lot- of sunxi stuff in the past (worked on CHIP/PocketCHIP)


[6/14/2022 11:07 PM] tux_linux
Ok very good


[6/14/2022 11:07 PM] tux_linux
People like that are rare


[6/14/2022 11:07 PM] djhardrich
Even a chrooted environment with the xdamage-fbink would be great


[6/14/2022 11:07 PM] tux_linux
That's kobox


[6/14/2022 11:08 PM] djhardrich
That was my thought (only saw kobox/inkbox last night)


[6/14/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
You also know how to setup a serial connection I assume?


[6/14/2022 11:10 PM] tux_linux
You're not afraid of bricking? Actually, we should have FEL mode in there
But still


[6/14/2022 11:10 PM] djhardrich
Yes but not on the elipsa (I have a spare, can take it apart to wire an ftdi chip to it)


[6/14/2022 11:10 PM] tux_linux
A spare elipsa?


[6/14/2022 11:10 PM] djhardrich
And apparently FEL isn’t documented on the a50, but *shrug*


[6/14/2022 11:10 PM] djhardrich
Yes 🙂 and an rm2 if you ever want that supported as well


[6/14/2022 11:11 PM] tux_linux
We need to see if it's possible
Then we can be a lot less careful


[6/14/2022 11:12 PM] tux_linux
FB API is closed source, it's handled in userspace
Maybe once the reverse engineering team finish their project


[6/14/2022 11:12 PM] djhardrich
I’m guessing a kernel rebuild is necessary for stuff like otg host but I’ll know more in 2 days (have a power splitter cable coming, may be able to just power vbus and have otg working)


[6/14/2022 11:12 PM] djhardrich
Ahh for some reason I thought fbink supported it


[6/14/2022 11:13 PM] tux_linux
Rm1 I think


[6/14/2022 11:13 PM] djhardrich
got it


[6/14/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
on all kobos i know usb otg is working only when the ereader is being charged


[6/14/2022 11:13 PM] szybet
maybe the elipsa is diffrent


[6/14/2022 11:13 PM] djhardrich
Which is fine if it works like that on the elipsa, I wouldn’t lose sleep over using the stock kernel with a mechanical keyboard/otg with small battery


[6/14/2022 11:14 PM] djhardrich
It definitely doesn’t work without external power


[6/14/2022 11:14 PM] djhardrich
the other hack is to just pair/trust a bt keyboard and mouse using hcitool and be done with it 😉


[6/14/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
There is kterm in KoBox
Don't know if you prefer that to inkvt
Both are nice


[6/14/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
There's also a VNC viewer


[6/14/2022 11:15 PM] djhardrich
Probably, I’m super interested in using it (and also a vnc viewer)


[6/14/2022 11:15 PM] tux_linux
Not sure how it will behave on such a large screen though


[6/14/2022 11:16 PM] djhardrich
Basically ssh/vscode (even if remote)/maybe awesomewm/i3 would be perfection 🙂

[6/14/2022 11:18 PM] djhardrich
I’ll start an actual thread later on tonight, wanted to ask NiLuJe if I was somehow doing something wrong for fbink/inkvt elipsa builds, since he’s built koreader/plato for elipsa


[6/14/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
What's the elipsa's model number?


[6/14/2022 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Ok n604 it seems


[6/14/2022 11:21 PM] djhardrich
I’ve got root if you need any more info/files pulled, really the only thing that doesn’t seem 100% as far as crossbuilds is the way inkvt (my build with fbink) is drawing to the elipsa’s screen (very slowly, “ls” takes like 40 seconds to draw 20 items (and doesn’t display 90% of the characters)

{Reactions}
👍 

[6/14/2022 11:26 PM] djhardrich
Weird because “ls” is the only command I’ve found so far that draws like that, if I do cat /proc/cpuinfo it isn’t as slow/character by character


[6/15/2022 1:37 PM] ninuje
I don't recall testing inkvt more than "whelp, echo works, I'm done" :p


[6/15/2022 1:38 PM] ninuje
The weird collision handling on the Elipsa might not be entirely playing ball with it


[6/15/2022 1:38 PM] ninuje
Without switching pen mode on


[6/15/2022 1:39 PM] ninuje
Which has its own set of drawbacks (like, err, very easily crashing the EPDC :D


[6/15/2022 1:39 PM] ninuje
(definitely start from my fork, though, it probably has a few fixes, and a mostly up to date fbink dép)


[6/15/2022 5:28 PM] djhardrich
Wish I wrote more C and not Verilog these days 😵‍💫😵‍💫 A little out of my depth patching it, but will take a closer look and see what I can come up with


[6/16/2022 10:32 PM] tux_linux
Anyways, we will probably have to look at it, InkBox is using FBInk in a lot of areas of the system


[6/16/2022 10:33 PM] djhardrich
I’m willing to chip in to the bounty jar, I just know I’m out of my element a -hair- as far as hacking on fbink……


[6/16/2022 10:34 PM] djhardrich
Also had a thought; maybe the rm2 port of yaft (https://github.com/timower/rM2-stuff/tree/master/apps/yaft ) would be a good candidate for a minimal terminal with an ok on-screen-keyboard that can be hidden easily when using hardware keyboards…. Would need to be ported to use fbink; it’s a framebuffer terminal already… advantage is that people moving from rm2 would also feel at home

[6/17/2022 12:09 AM] djhardrich
Note: the issue I’m running into seems to be inkvt-specific, or rather; Plato/KoReader on Elipsa work -perfectly- when drawing to the screen, as does KoReader’s built in terminal (apart from missing keyboard support etc)


[6/17/2022 12:16 AM] ninuje
I don't think you've actually *described* the issue yet, though, did you? ;o)


[6/17/2022 12:17 AM] ninuje
(yaft should be doable, it just happens to do its own fb drawing, but that can be arranged)


[6/17/2022 12:18 AM] djhardrich
I can film a video, doing “ls” in inkvt doesn’t draw to the screen properly (90% of the characters aren’t drawn, and it’s refreshing character by character, making “ls” take 20-60 seconds depending on the size of the file list)


[6/17/2022 12:19 AM] ninuje
Okay, yeah, definitely sunxi collision handling being broke as fuck


[6/17/2022 12:19 AM] ninuje
and even more broken on the Elipsa than on the Sage


[6/17/2022 12:19 AM] ninuje
pen mode might help, or it might just murder the epdc


[6/17/2022 12:19 AM] djhardrich
inkvt would be really usable with a keyboard otherwise (tested with keyboard paired to phone via bt and ssh’ed into elipsa, running inkvt and sending keys)

Screen doesn’t always corrupt like that, but also probably worth noting 😅 *never* experienced that in your releases of KoReader/Plato, if that helps

Command was `ls /usr/bin`


[6/17/2022 1:09 AM] ninuje
Oh, nickel is running.

(as in, it's never going to work on an Elipsa. Might be slightly less worse on a Sage, but I wouldn't count on it)


[6/17/2022 1:12 AM] djhardrich
Excuse my not knowing a -ton- of the inner workings as they regard to kobo-specific stuff, only started getting ereaders once the 10.3” ones came out 😅; killall nickel from ssh? So far all I’ve installed was the KoReader+Plato installer, your dev extras with ssh/other tools and this build of inkvt (just trying to give you as much info as possible)


[6/17/2022 1:14 AM] djhardrich
Or better; am I supposed to have nickel on here?


[6/17/2022 1:23 AM] djhardrich
No corruption with nickel killed, but same issue and inkvt crashed before it finished the `ls /usr/bin`

InkVT relies *extremely* heavily on both of those things actually working ;o)


[6/17/2022 1:29 AM] ninuje
(As well as dealing with a storm of tiny refresh ioctls, which ties into the whole "collision handling is broken" thing)


[6/17/2022 1:29 AM] ninuje
Which is also why pen mode might 'help' (because it essentially disables collision merges)


[6/17/2022 1:30 AM] ninuje
But it's also extremely finicky (it pegs a core to 100% cpu because it's a busy-looping kernel thread (sigh)), and has a tendency to just plain murder the epdc if you don't appease it every now and then.

[6/17/2022 1:36 AM] djhardrich
Bigger question: would chrooting and using fbink-xdamage with a different shell help/fix it? Or does the lack of solid collision handling break that as well? I’m not tied to any particular program outside of the chroot


[6/17/2022 1:45 AM] ninuje
Nope, it's a kernel issue.

{Reactions}
😣 

[6/17/2022 1:47 AM] djhardrich
Is it because the kernel (4.19.x) is so old, or hasn’t been implemented in sunxi-linux (which I guess is mainline now?)


[6/17/2022 1:47 AM] ninuje
the display driver is just a horrible, horrible mess

Some early work to get pmOS running on the Kindle 4/5 devices from 2011ish. It's based on the work located here and here: ...

[6/27/2022 3:11 PM] nonasuomy
"This is starting with a very hobbled mainline kernel, because I dunno, I don't think downstream is an option? The Amazon GPL dumps are a metric barfload of Freescale patches mingled with Lab126 drive-by-hackery on kernel internals, based off 2.6.x. That seems too old to be useful, and I'm not particularly eager to try and rebase that code into 3.x land. So, mainline it is. Luckily, all the i.MX5xx SoC bits and pieces seem pretty well mainlined by this point. The Tequila board in the Kindle 4 uses a PMIC that also appears to have quite a lot of mainline kernel code already. So .."

This guy should write comedy... "the hacked up U-Boot from 2009 that currently boots these devices does support fastboot, it's that strange one that makes everybody in the family kinda look at the floor when it comes up. You know?"

[6/27/2022 3:18 PM] tux_linux
Almost all eReaders <= 2016 I know run U-Boot 2009.08


[6/27/2022 3:21 PM] nonasuomy
"The way the initramfs is unceremoniously smooshed into some grey-market eMMC space is also gross, and doesn't really line up with any existing patterns for existing device ports. It's kinda like the isorec trick, but there's no actual spare partition to use, just random barely-legit-looking memory addresses that magically happen to have some gzipped cpio initramfs living there :)"

Sounds like another device we know...

[6/27/2022 3:23 PM] nonasuomy
"I'm getting to a point here though. From what I can tell, the bootloader on these devices is completely unlocked and open. U-Boot seems to just be living at 0x0 on partition 1 of the eMMC. I don't believe Amazon rolled out signed booting until the i.MX6+ based devices."

[6/27/2022 3:30 PM] nonasuomy
what does it mean that he can't port kernel 3 but can use mainline which is 5?


[6/27/2022 3:32 PM] tux_linux
The 3.x port might have been easier to do than 5.x but since the Kindle kernel source is so heavily patched, it would just be too complicated to implement those patches in 3.x
In 4.x the kernel switched to DTS/DTB files for describing hardware to the kernel, so patching is not really present anymore because DTBs cover pretty much all of the required info

I think it's what he meant?


[6/27/2022 3:33 PM] nonasuomy
So that makes it easier to use a newer kernel?


[6/27/2022 3:33 PM] nonasuomy
He's using kernel 5


[6/27/2022 3:34 PM] tux_linux
Yeah, but harder to port first because you have to reverse-engineer a lot of memory addresses to tell the kernel where your memory, MMC, display, i2c, SPI components are


[6/27/2022 7:57 PM] nonasuomy
I just thought newer kernels would be even more far away from the original kernel used so nothing would be close to working or porting easily.

[7/29/2022 5:09 PM] szybet
well, he can help with it


[7/29/2022 5:10 PM] nabakolu
Currently don't own a device. I'm checking what device with an open source OS to buy


[7/29/2022 5:10 PM] nabakolu
InkBox uses mupdf right?


[7/29/2022 5:10 PM] tux_linux
90% of the members of this server join, then maybe say hi, then maybe stay here for a day or so, then lose interest and don't ever come back
(In response to Szybet)


[7/29/2022 5:10 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] nabakolu
I might lose interest. But that's gonna take a while


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] szybet
we will see


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Szybet has been here for 6 months


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] nabakolu
Does that mean all mupdf supported formats are supported, or only epub pdf and plaintext?


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] tux_linux
I am here since 1 1/2y


[7/29/2022 5:11 PM] tux_linux
Only PDF and Epub


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
txts are supported too?


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Plaintext is handled by quirky python


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
not python.


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Which we didn't fix yet


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
rust


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
it is fixed


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Yes but it doesn't work


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
what?


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] tux_linux
Remember?


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
no?


[7/29/2022 5:12 PM] szybet
why?


[7/29/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
instead of reading books on an ereader i buyed i develop software for it


[7/29/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
🥴


[7/29/2022 5:14 PM] nabakolu
Why exactly the Glo and not the mini, touch, aura or nia?


[7/29/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
*Glo HD


[7/29/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
All other ones have less RAM and are slower


[7/29/2022 5:15 PM] szybet
its ok on the nia


[7/29/2022 5:16 PM] tux_linux
Yes too


[7/29/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
But you get half the RAM and half the screen resolution


[7/29/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
And it might actually be more expensive


[7/29/2022 5:17 PM] szybet
the price is stupid tho


[7/29/2022 5:18 PM] nabakolu
Also how hard is it to remove the cover to get to the sd card?


[7/29/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
on the nia? really hard


[7/29/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
i cant do this without an ifixit tool


[7/29/2022 5:19 PM] nabakolu
is it easier on the glo hd?


[7/29/2022 5:19 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[7/29/2022 5:19 PM] nabakolu
I'm *really* bad with hardware. Just a software guy


[7/29/2022 5:19 PM] szybet
i created a case replacement for the nia, and a replacement for the stock back, its 3d printable


[7/29/2022 5:20 PM] szybet
you can use a sd card expander with it and never open the device again


[7/29/2022 5:20 PM] nabakolu
with a cable to outside the case?


[7/29/2022 5:21 PM] szybet
yes


[7/29/2022 5:21 PM] szybet
you need some really good soldering skills


[7/29/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
its an option, only saying


[7/29/2022 5:23 PM] nabakolu
In the end the maximum I could brake was the case right?


[7/29/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
on the nia its solid, too solid so no worries for that


[7/29/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
there is a flex cable going near the edge, you need to look for it


[7/29/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
also the case gets ugly and destroyed if you open it too many times


[7/29/2022 5:25 PM] szybet
thats the reason for the 3d print


[7/29/2022 5:28 PM] szybet
the nia has currently also battery issues with the kernel we got


[7/29/2022 5:29 PM] szybet
you will be safe with the glo HD, its older and everything propably works on it


[7/29/2022 5:30 PM] nabakolu
Are they even being sold anymore? Can only find one for 300€


[7/29/2022 5:30 PM] szybet
thats the issue propably


[7/29/2022 5:34 PM] nabakolu
Meaning?


[7/29/2022 5:34 PM] szybet
its worse than on the stock os

Nia kernel sources are outdated · Issue #117 · kobolabs/Kobo-Reader
The kernel shipped with nickel is different in many ways ( battery consumption, touchscreen wake up calls ). Could we get an updated version in the repo, Please?
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/117-09D3F


[7/29/2022 5:35 PM] szybet
becouse they dont update it


[7/29/2022 5:37 PM] nabakolu
ah


[7/29/2022 5:55 PM] nabakolu
Welp guess I'm buying a glo hd


[7/29/2022 5:55 PM] tux_linux
good


[7/29/2022 5:55 PM] szybet
at what price?


[7/29/2022 5:55 PM] nabakolu
100€


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] szybet
thats acceptable


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
no...


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
i bought mine for $30


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] nabakolu
It is used, but apparently in good condition


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] tux_linux
well, if the screen is ok then the device should be ok


[7/29/2022 5:56 PM] nabakolu
Well the nia would be 100€ and the other glo hd 300€


[7/29/2022 5:57 PM] szybet
its sad how ereaders are so expensive


[7/29/2022 5:57 PM] szybet
the hardware could be from 2010 android smartphones


[7/29/2022 5:57 PM] nabakolu
Isn't eink quite expensive?


[7/29/2022 5:58 PM] szybet
~70% of the cost of the nia costs a similar worse eink screen, a screen module without anything else


[7/29/2022 5:58 PM] szybet
even more


[7/29/2022 5:59 PM] tux_linux
true


[7/29/2022 5:59 PM] szybet
and its bec***au***se of... monopoly? idk english


[7/29/2022 6:00 PM] tux_linux
because


[7/29/2022 6:00 PM] tux_linux

[7/29/2022 6:14 PM] nabakolu
apk package manager exists right?


[7/29/2022 6:14 PM] tux_linux
yes but don't count on using it


[7/29/2022 6:14 PM] tux_linux
eventually inkbox itself should separate completely from alpine
and use a reproducible rootfs build tool


[7/29/2022 6:15 PM] tux_linux
because we are already stuck in 2019 with Alpine


[7/29/2022 6:15 PM] tux_linux
since... old kernels on 10+ years old devices


[7/29/2022 6:15 PM] szybet
never count on alpine


[7/29/2022 6:15 PM] szybet
but i have used many i2c debug binaries and they worked, i installed them


[7/29/2022 6:15 PM] szybet
so some things are working


[7/29/2022 6:16 PM] tux_linux
oh, things work


[7/29/2022 6:16 PM] tux_linux
but they are outdated


[7/29/2022 6:16 PM] szybet
its better than building everything from scratch


[7/29/2022 6:16 PM] tux_linux
if I want to put a new program in the rootfs, I try to compile it from source before resorting to apk if it really doesn't want to build


[7/29/2022 6:17 PM] tux_linux
90% of the time I put a compiled program with its most recent version


[7/29/2022 6:17 PM] szybet
and then ntpd stops working, lights turn off and there is silence


[7/29/2022 6:17 PM] szybet
but i understand


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
I think I will use `time.google.com` for ntpd


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
or `time.apple.com`


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
these seem to work


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] szybet
☹️


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
then find something non-proprietary that works


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] szybet
***p r i v a c y***?


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
it's... a time server


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] szybet
really?


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
i don't think you get any privacy issues with time servers


[7/29/2022 6:18 PM] tux_linux
yes, tried them

it worked with ntpdate at least


[7/29/2022 6:20 PM] tux_linux
but pool.ntp.org didn't work with ntpdate


[7/29/2022 6:20 PM] tux_linux
only time.apple.com


[7/29/2022 6:20 PM] tux_linux
and maybe google


[7/29/2022 6:20 PM] tux_linux
wait I'll send the binary


[7/29/2022 6:20 PM] szybet
dont use apple

[7/30/2022 12:40 AM] nabakolu
I was wondering about git + gcc


[7/30/2022 12:42 AM] szybet
why git? git would be slow, its using compression

gcc is provided by the distro... we have 3 diffrent toolchains


[7/30/2022 12:42 AM] szybet
but git sure, you can use it


[7/30/2022 12:54 AM] nabakolu

[8/4/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
well, i dont


[8/4/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
there are some issues


[8/4/2022 9:47 PM] szybet
but i wont tell you about them ;p


[8/4/2022 9:50 PM] nabakolu
Going to a chapter doesnt work right?


[8/4/2022 9:51 PM] szybet
chapter in what way? book chapter?


[8/4/2022 9:51 PM] nabakolu
Yes


[8/4/2022 9:51 PM] szybet
there isin't an option for it at all


[8/4/2022 9:52 PM] nabakolu
Okay


[8/4/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
maybe some day


[8/4/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[8/4/2022 9:53 PM] nabakolu
And saving where I left?


[8/4/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
works


[8/4/2022 9:53 PM] szybet
but i had issues with it


[8/4/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
it will be rewrited soon


[8/4/2022 9:54 PM] nabakolu
Man you guys are amazing


[8/4/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
@tux-linux is


[8/4/2022 9:54 PM] szybet
im here only for 6~ months


[8/4/2022 9:55 PM] szybet
i dont have really done many things


[8/4/2022 10:14 PM] nabakolu
Me too :D


[8/4/2022 10:20 PM] tux_linux
which ones


[8/4/2022 10:20 PM] szybet
global reading settings


[8/4/2022 10:20 PM] szybet
thats all you need to know :D

You need to disable global reading settings in settings


[8/5/2022 5:35 PM] tux_linux
Why
What issues


[8/5/2022 5:36 PM] szybet
text to slider
save phrases not words
bugs bugs


[8/5/2022 5:36 PM] szybet
maybe not rewritted, but changed for sure


[8/5/2022 5:36 PM] tux_linux
text to slider?


[8/5/2022 5:36 PM] szybet
fit enough text that the slider isint needed


[8/5/2022 5:36 PM] tux_linux
Oh


[8/5/2022 5:37 PM] szybet
but this will go for 2.1 propably

[8/5/2022 5:38 PM] tux_linux
Ideally we ought to get 2.0 out before the end of August so people don't think we vanished


[8/5/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
after i finish *niAudio* pcb i will do the library widget folders, and wifi panel

[8/5/2022 5:39 PM] tux_linux
Cool


[8/5/2022 5:40 PM] tux_linux
I could implement highlighting in reader


[8/5/2022 5:40 PM] tux_linux
But I should probably wait for your rewrite before


[8/5/2022 5:41 PM] szybet
if you implement saving phrases i wont rewrite much, i will add the slider text match to the existing code


[8/5/2022 5:41 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/5/2022 5:42 PM] szybet
but if no, i will simply rewrite it


[8/6/2022 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
Post that you are working on 2.0 and also post a list of 2.0 features


[8/6/2022 3:18 AM] nabakolu
Ah nice. What is Global Reader settings supposed to do/represent?


[8/6/2022 9:41 AM] szybet
Something to do with saving reading progress. I'm here for 6 months and I don't know exactly anyway🥴


[8/7/2022 1:29 AM] szybet

We have Wi-Fi on Glo everyone
bcmdhd is crap
but it works

you wanted wifi


[8/7/2022 1:36 PM] tux_linux
Firmware issue


[8/7/2022 1:38 PM] szybet
you mean?


[8/7/2022 1:38 PM] szybet
further explanation?


[8/7/2022 1:40 PM] tux_linux
Basically in /lib/firmware in the stock root filesystem there are firmware files for Wi-Fi
In 2021 it seems I only tested with WC121 and not WC121A2
Maybe that and a bit flip

Works on Mini


[8/7/2022 3:03 PM] szybet
nice


[8/7/2022 3:03 PM] szybet
does iwlist eth0 scan work?


[8/7/2022 3:08 PM] tux_linux
yes


[8/7/2022 3:08 PM] tux_linux
You don't seem to handle if the led option is enabled or not when initially turning the led on if the device is charging


[8/7/2022 3:10 PM] szybet
i dont understand?


[8/7/2022 3:47 PM] tux_linux
When the device is charging, is powered on but led option is disabled
The led still turns on


[8/7/2022 3:48 PM] szybet
when you disconnect / connect the charger it still turns on?


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux
It seems to


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] szybet
impossible...


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux
I'm testing it on the mini


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux
Yes it's possible


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] szybet
```
void ledManager() {
  if (ledUsage == true) {
    if (occupyLed.try_lock() == true) {
      occupyLed.unlock();
      if (getAccurateChargerStatus() == true) {
        if (ledState == 0) {
          setLedState(true);
        }
      } else {
        if (ledState == 1) {
          setLedState(false);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] tux_linux
What's newSleepCondition exactly?


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] szybet
the first if


[8/7/2022 3:59 PM] szybet
how


[8/7/2022 4:00 PM] szybet
it says what caused the suspend


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] szybet
isint used for anything, but can be usefull in the future


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] szybet
leave it, its only one variable and one mutex


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] tux_linux
So it seems it doesn't notifySend when it's idle


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] tux_linux
I use it


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] szybet
for what?


[8/7/2022 4:01 PM] szybet
????


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] tux_linux
limited internet access
rg notifySend


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] szybet
it seems like your entire config is flipped over what you think it is


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] szybet
i still dont understand


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] szybet
can you show me the config dir?


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] tux_linux
rg = ripgrep


[8/7/2022 4:02 PM] tux_linux
So you can see where it is


[8/7/2022 4:03 PM] szybet
what...


[8/7/2022 4:03 PM] tux_linux
In watchdog.cpp:59


[8/7/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
what are you doing there>


[8/7/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
why.........


[8/7/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
why only show this when idle?


[8/7/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
you have broken it completly


[8/7/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
you dont use a mutex


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
say what is needed to be done and i will do it, dont break things


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] tux_linux
When not idle


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] tux_linux
It works on every other device


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] tux_linux
Except mini


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
oh


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
show me you config dir


[8/7/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
cat it

[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] tux_linux
Yeah and?


[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] szybet
led is enabled


[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] szybet
idle sleep is off


[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] szybet
and you are complaining about them


[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] tux_linux
The notify send toast doesn't show up any time, whether idle sleep is enabled or not


[8/7/2022 4:28 PM] tux_linux
The led is not powering on


[8/7/2022 4:29 PM] szybet
only on the mini?


[8/7/2022 4:29 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[8/7/2022 4:32 PM] tux_linux
And it's the same path


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] szybet
you have broken some things


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] szybet
i will fix them later


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] tux_linux
Which are


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] szybet
mutexes for sure


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/7/2022 4:36 PM] tux_linux
But why is the led not powering on


[8/7/2022 4:37 PM] tux_linux
And why does it work on the Glo
Which literally has the same path


[8/7/2022 4:37 PM] szybet
try it on the shell?


[8/7/2022 4:37 PM] szybet
echo it?


[8/7/2022 4:43 PM] tux_linux
Yes I did


[8/7/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
weird


[8/7/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
is write status 0?


[8/7/2022 4:46 PM] szybet
i mean `write(dev, "100", 3);`


[8/7/2022 4:46 PM] szybet
get an int from that and log it, what it is


[8/7/2022 4:46 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/7/2022 4:50 PM] tux_linux
Now it powers on
Nonsense


[8/7/2022 4:50 PM] szybet
maybe you had an outdated version od ipd?


[8/7/2022 4:50 PM] tux_linux
I doubt it


[8/7/2022 4:51 PM] szybet
try the led too


[8/7/2022 4:58 PM] tux_linux
Repacked rootfs with newly built binary, no led again


[8/7/2022 4:58 PM] tux_linux
Even after stop/start ipd


[8/7/2022 4:58 PM] szybet
you mean?


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
The led never lights up


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] szybet
wait 30s?


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
Unless I go to suspend


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
Why


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] szybet
just do it


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
Ok it works after 30s


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] tux_linux
But why is it like that


[8/7/2022 4:59 PM] szybet
the charger detection propably doesnt wo... okay


[8/7/2022 5:00 PM] szybet
becouse inkbox.sh is turning it off


[8/7/2022 5:00 PM] szybet
and after some time at first boot ipd checks one more time the led to be sure


[8/7/2022 5:00 PM] szybet
on the nia its instand, the mini is slower? faster?


[8/7/2022 5:00 PM] tux_linux
So could you handle turning it off or not at startup and I remove those lines from inkbox.sh?


[8/7/2022 5:00 PM] szybet
sure


[8/7/2022 5:01 PM] tux_linux
Caution, for some devices there is a specific sequence to follow initially it seems


[8/7/2022 5:01 PM] szybet
???


[8/7/2022 5:02 PM] szybet
couldn't you turn the led off when the initrd starts openrc services?


[8/7/2022 5:02 PM] szybet
not in the last stage?


[8/7/2022 5:02 PM] tux_linux
I could too


[8/7/2022 5:03 PM] tux_linux
Check inkbox.sh


[8/7/2022 5:03 PM] szybet
earlier


[8/7/2022 5:03 PM] szybet
its too late


[8/7/2022 5:13 PM] tux_linux
Ok now the toast shows up


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] szybet
without any change?


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
Please fix what you said was to fix


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] szybet
later


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] szybet
outdated ipd version 🥴


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
No
It didn't show up at launch


[8/7/2022 5:14 PM] tux_linux
Only now


[8/7/2022 5:15 PM] szybet
so i have only to do the mutex and idle sleep time chooser?


[8/7/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
Oh no
It shows up right after restarting it now


[8/7/2022 5:15 PM] szybet
?


[8/7/2022 5:15 PM] tux_linux
Wait I'll reboot to be sure


[8/7/2022 5:16 PM] tux_linux
But why do I need to deal with mutexes if I only check the value of an enum


[8/7/2022 5:16 PM] szybet
well, bec***AU***se thats how mutexes work


[8/7/2022 5:17 PM] szybet
read about them


[8/7/2022 5:17 PM] szybet
pretty cool things


[8/7/2022 5:17 PM] tux_linux
because


[8/7/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
***AU***


[8/7/2022 5:18 PM] tux_linux
Well now it works
after restarting


[8/7/2022 5:19 PM] tux_linux
You should try it on the Nia
I don't see what could be broken


[8/7/2022 5:19 PM] szybet
what works?


[8/7/2022 5:20 PM] tux_linux
Toast


[8/7/2022 5:21 PM] szybet
if you break mutexes, things can break randomly


[8/7/2022 5:21 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/7/2022 5:21 PM] tux_linux
But why wasn't there anything related to mutexes there in the first place


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
there is


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
everywhere


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] tux_linux
Then what's wrong in my commit


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
you dont lock the mutex


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
before checking


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] tux_linux
Oh ok


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
i will do it


[8/7/2022 5:22 PM] szybet
dont touch


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
It's one line?


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
3


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
4


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
5


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
5 exactly


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
5 if you do it right, so let me do it


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] tux_linux
Test if it still works before pushing


[8/7/2022 5:23 PM] szybet
i always test


[8/7/2022 5:24 PM] tux_linux
Ok
So I move led things to initrd rcS?


[8/7/2022 5:24 PM] tux_linux
Wouldn't it be simpler to just turn it off from ipd service before it starts?


[8/7/2022 5:24 PM] szybet
your decission


[8/7/2022 5:24 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/7/2022 5:30 PM] tux_linux
After that we don't need to change anything in ipd source code?


[8/7/2022 5:50 PM] tux_linux
Ok now after moving led turnoff to ipd service, it doesn't work until I suspend


[8/7/2022 5:51 PM] tux_linux
Actually it isn't realizing that it's charging


[8/7/2022 5:51 PM] szybet
decide what solution you want and i will implement it


[8/7/2022 5:51 PM] tux_linux
First find the problem


[8/7/2022 5:51 PM] szybet
what is the problem?


[8/7/2022 5:52 PM] tux_linux
Why does it know it's charging when trying to sleep but not when it needs to light the led up


[8/7/2022 5:53 PM] szybet
it doesnt


[8/7/2022 5:53 PM] tux_linux
?


[8/7/2022 5:53 PM] szybet
what is the problem


[8/7/2022 5:53 PM] szybet
without goind to sleep


[8/7/2022 5:54 PM] tux_linux
It knows how to turn on the led on suspend and wake up
But not when it's charging
E.g. it turns it on on wake up but then it immediately turns it off even if it's charging


[8/7/2022 5:55 PM] tux_linux
Maybe it's actually all related?


[8/7/2022 5:55 PM] tux_linux
Also we need to move to #dev


[8/7/2022 5:56 PM] szybet
maybe

[8/9/2022 12:44 AM] szybet
what did you actually changed?


[8/9/2022 12:45 AM] tux_linux
I compiled the dhd.ko module and I added the correct firmware files


[8/9/2022 12:45 AM] szybet
separate compiling of a kernel module?


[8/9/2022 12:45 AM] the.mightydill
> I compiled the dhd.ko module
***WHAT***


[8/9/2022 12:45 AM] szybet
shouldnt it be just `make modules`?


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] the.mightydill
did it...


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] the.mightydill
work?


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
no, first I had to integrate it in the tree


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] szybet
@dill


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
with some random script from a MR guy


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] szybet
what...


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
then fiddle with random issues


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
and random issues
and more random issues


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] szybet
so kobo shared an uncomplete kernel again?


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
and more random issues


[8/9/2022 12:46 AM] tux_linux
(almost) always


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] tux_linux
they provided the wifi module source separately


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] szybet
😂


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] szybet
its propably the IC manufacturer fault


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] the.mightydill
iiiiiiiiiiiiloveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] tux_linux
try it


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] the.mightydill
jkjk


[8/9/2022 12:47 AM] tux_linux
and learn how the os works at the same time


[8/9/2022 12:48 AM] the.mightydill

[8/9/2022 12:48 AM] tux_linux
update it manually yourself


[8/9/2022 12:48 AM] tux_linux
yes


[8/9/2022 12:48 AM] the.mightydill
alright when i hvae time

"Ok give me some time, i will rewrite it from 0"


[8/9/2022 12:49 AM] szybet
;p


[8/9/2022 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
yeah what i mean is, i'm on a mini and im very busy


[8/9/2022 12:50 AM] szybet
it *should* work on the mini


[8/9/2022 12:50 AM] the.mightydill
alright i'll do it when i get home hopefully


[8/9/2022 12:50 AM] the.mightydill

Could this be the next Kobo Clara HD or Nia iteration? Kobo Reader


[8/10/2022 2:22 PM] szybet
no sense


[8/10/2022 2:22 PM] szybet
but


[8/10/2022 2:22 PM] szybet
tolibo has some contracts with a german internet supplier, maybe because of that


[8/10/2022 4:33 PM] aryetis
I mean why not ? it makes sense to me, direct access to any library anywhere, at anytime.
Now, would I invest more for it ? No. But if it's there and my phone provider can provide a second sim card for free.... Meh why not.


[8/10/2022 4:34 PM] szybet
it will be propably like that:
no sim card but one day, you will lose the 5G because the contract runned out ( just like it was on kindles )


[8/10/2022 4:35 PM] aryetis
5g access simless ? That I've never seen before.


[8/10/2022 4:36 PM] aryetis
still I wouldn't fight for nor against it. I don't really care, I don't read enough to burn throught all my books in between each time I have access to some wifi.


[8/10/2022 4:37 PM] szybet
also 5G... i dont think its very power efficient + 5G towers have really low range ( because thats from where the speed comes from ) so outside of cities, lets say on a beach you wont get any signal

why didnt they used 4G LTE? its everywhere, and the speeds are too good to transfer... books


[8/10/2022 4:37 PM] szybet
i doubt there vere sim cards inside kindles


[8/10/2022 4:37 PM] szybet
for me putting 5G in a ereader is stupid, its not a technology for that


[8/10/2022 4:39 PM] aryetis
<https://www.devicespecifications.com/en/comparison/2e3a19c0f2> looks like kindles do have micro sim


[8/10/2022 4:39 PM] aryetis
and yeah 4g lte might makes more sense. Even mangas/comics/cbz are around 100Mb so it doesn't take that long to download using 4g


[8/10/2022 5:15 PM] ninuje

this also


[8/19/2022 3:08 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet has a Nia and contributes a lot to my code


[8/19/2022 3:08 AM] tux_linux
he is asleep right now but he will be able to guide you if you run into problems for the Nia


[8/19/2022 3:08 AM] tux_linux
TBH, you would be better off flashing the image and then compiling only the parts you want to change


[8/19/2022 3:09 AM] tux_linux
have you read about the security features this OS has?


[8/19/2022 3:09 AM] nwroot

[8/19/2022 3:10 AM] tux_linux
you ... can't really (well, if you do, I will not accept the PR ^^)
but you can build and sign all packages yourself if you want
which we can guide you through


[8/19/2022 3:11 AM] tux_linux
it is designed with the possibility that one day it could be implemented on a custom device that could sell like a kobo


[8/19/2022 3:11 AM] tux_linux
**one day**


[8/19/2022 3:12 AM] tux_linux
you can also obtain a developer key, which eases signature verification a bit


[8/19/2022 3:14 AM] nwroot
haha ofc


[8/19/2022 3:14 AM] nwroot
I am talking about building without it


[8/19/2022 3:14 AM] tux_linux
what if you built it with your own keypair?


[8/19/2022 3:14 AM] tux_linux
this removes all the restrictions


[8/19/2022 3:15 AM] nwroot
That would also work


[8/19/2022 3:15 AM] tux_linux
except you can't update it without compiling packages yourself


[8/19/2022 3:15 AM] tux_linux

ye


[8/19/2022 4:10 AM] nwroot
Lmao


[8/19/2022 4:10 AM] nwroot
deleted everything and retried


[8/19/2022 4:10 AM] nwroot
it worked now


[8/19/2022 4:10 AM] tux_linux
good


[8/19/2022 4:11 AM] nwroot
Btw I need both the linaro toolchain *and* the koxtoolchain right?


[8/19/2022 4:11 AM] nwroot
or just the kox one


[8/19/2022 4:11 AM] tux_linux
the linaro toolchain is included in the kernel repo


[8/19/2022 4:11 AM] tux_linux
so you just need to compile the kox one


[8/19/2022 4:11 AM] nwroot
Alright

https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/kernel/config/config-n306#L130


[8/19/2022 5:26 AM] nwroot
is it me or this hardcoded path is just wrong


[8/19/2022 5:26 AM] tux_linux
you need a symlink


[8/19/2022 5:30 AM] nwroot
Oh, alright

[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] nwroot
Alright so managed to build the kernel and the rootfs


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] tux_linux
congratulations


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] nwroot
however I can't figure out how to actually compile inkbox


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] nwroot
qmake?


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] tux_linux
yes


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] tux_linux
`qmake && make`


[8/19/2022 6:06 AM] nwroot
any qmake? it seems to be using my arch compiler


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] tux_linux
the qmake you compiled


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] nwroot
or will it use the toolchain automagically


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] tux_linux
you did compile qt?


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] nwroot
Uh


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] nwroot
I did the koxtoolchain script


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] tux_linux
that's only half the way


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] nwroot
that doesn't have qt doesnt it


[8/19/2022 6:07 AM] nwroot
oh well


[8/19/2022 6:08 AM] nwroot
do I want a specific version of Qt?


[8/19/2022 6:08 AM] nwroot
or do I just grab the latest and compile


[8/19/2022 6:08 AM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/blob/main/apps-on-kobo/qt-setup.md


[8/19/2022 6:08 AM] tux_linux
grab 5.15.2


[8/19/2022 6:09 AM] tux_linux
good luck


[8/19/2022 6:09 AM] nwroot
thanks


[8/19/2022 6:09 AM] tux_linux
if it doesn't work I can send you my binaries
but you seem to want to learn all of this yourself
so go ahead


[8/19/2022 6:09 AM] nwroot
Yeah


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] nwroot
I wanted to compile the kernel, boot and userspace


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] nwroot
rootfs uhhh


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] nwroot
no thanks


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] tux_linux
you don't have to compile the platform plugin


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] tux_linux
(here https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/blob/main/apps-on-kobo/qt-setup.md#install-your-custom-qt-to-kobo)


[8/19/2022 6:10 AM] tux_linux
it's already on the gui-bundle and should work


[8/19/2022 7:01 AM] nwroot
sorry to keep bothering you, but I finished compiling Qt and inkbox's bin

[8/19/2022 7:01 AM] nwroot
however the release scripts pulls these blobs


[8/19/2022 7:01 AM] nwroot
what are they?


[8/19/2022 7:12 AM] tux_linux
U-Boot+firmware blobs we don't have control over


[8/19/2022 7:12 AM] nwroot
Oh


[8/19/2022 7:12 AM] tux_linux
e.g. waveform


[8/19/2022 7:12 AM] nwroot
alright


[8/19/2022 7:13 AM] tux_linux
For the waveform, maybe you should take the one from your backup


[8/19/2022 7:14 AM] nwroot
what is waveform?


[8/19/2022 7:15 AM] nwroot
I'm googling and its some magic partition


[8/19/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
https://misc.andi.de1.cc/kobo/extract-waveform.pl


[8/19/2022 7:16 AM] tux_linux
Run that on your sd card backup


[8/19/2022 7:16 AM] nwroot
ok


[8/19/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
Then you need to reflash it to InkBox sd card
I think it's at offset 14336 but I don't remember for sure


[8/19/2022 7:17 AM] tux_linux
Maybe Szybet can help, it's 1.17am here


[8/19/2022 7:17 AM] nwroot
It's alright


[8/19/2022 7:17 AM] nwroot
thanks for the help

{Reactions}
👍 

[8/19/2022 7:18 AM] tux_linux
Normally it shouldn't be a problem but on some Kindles if you don't have the appropriate waveform for your device exactly the screen can stop working


[8/19/2022 7:18 AM] tux_linux
I never saw that happen on Kobos with my InkBox images


[8/19/2022 7:19 AM] tux_linux
So I think Kobos are ok with that


[8/19/2022 7:19 AM] tux_linux
But the best thing is to have your own waveform


[8/19/2022 7:20 AM] nwroot
I extracted the waveform

https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/emu/blob/main/sd/user.sqsh.a


[8/19/2022 7:20 AM] nwroot
Is this buildable?


[8/19/2022 7:21 AM] nwroot
or should I just use it


[8/19/2022 7:23 AM] tux_linux
Use it


[8/19/2022 9:21 AM] szybet
Heyyy


[8/19/2022 9:22 AM] szybet

[8/19/2022 5:46 PM] nwroot
maybe I missed where all the root features where


[8/19/2022 5:46 PM] nwroot
are they on settings?


[8/19/2022 5:46 PM] tux_linux
You need to enable usbnet

Ohh

is it just fat32?

Once I get back to my house I will send a picture


[8/19/2022 6:07 PM] tux_linux
Ok


[8/19/2022 6:59 PM] nwroot
Btw, some apps require a physical back button to exit


[8/19/2022 6:59 PM] nwroot
but the nia doesnt have one


[8/19/2022 6:59 PM] nwroot
How do I get around this


[8/19/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
which ones


[8/19/2022 7:12 PM] szybet
none ereader does


[8/19/2022 7:15 PM] nwroot
calculator, for example


[8/19/2022 7:15 PM] nwroot
or if I tell it to go to USB mode


[8/19/2022 7:15 PM] nwroot
I can't tell it to return unless in plug in the usb


[8/19/2022 7:16 PM] szybet
calculator needs a rewrite, i will do this one day
( @tux-linux please put the source on github )


[8/19/2022 7:16 PM] tux_linux
false


[8/19/2022 7:16 PM] tux_linux
reboot


[8/19/2022 7:16 PM] szybet
thats because there is no way to detect if you umounted the usbms. if you find a solution, let us know. kobo uses some kernel hacking propably


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] nwroot
no I mean


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] nwroot
if I for example accidentally press it


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] tux_linux
You need to unplug


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] tux_linux
Press what


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] nwroot
Let's say that I'm to settings page and fatfinger the "enable usb"


[8/19/2022 7:17 PM] nwroot
other than rebooting can I tell it to leave in some other way


[8/19/2022 7:18 PM] nwroot
also interestingly my kobo has a 16gb sdcard


[8/19/2022 7:18 PM] nwroot
yet the partitions all end on 8gb


[8/19/2022 7:18 PM] szybet
maybe we may implement it? its cool


[8/19/2022 7:18 PM] szybet
the kobo nia on inkbox has some free space


[8/19/2022 7:19 PM] szybet
you can use more than on stock


[8/19/2022 7:20 PM] nwroot
is there something like a terminal emulator inside inkbox?


[8/19/2022 7:20 PM] nwroot
other than SSH'ing in


[8/19/2022 7:21 PM] tux_linux
Yes there is


[8/19/2022 7:21 PM] nwroot
where


[8/19/2022 7:21 PM] tux_linux
But I need to update the user app


[8/19/2022 7:21 PM] tux_linux
Or you can just use kterm in x11


[8/19/2022 7:23 PM] szybet
it doesnt work?


[8/19/2022 7:23 PM] szybet
yet


[8/22/2022 10:55 PM] aryetis
Finally pulled the trigger and got a proper case replacement (and SD card extension) for my Glo, now I can finally properly test InkBox.


[8/22/2022 10:55 PM] aryetis
And somehow the touchpad is now fully working, no more deadzones.... I guess the little IR blockers or whatever on the side of the screens were broken / bent too.


[8/22/2022 11:09 PM] tux_linux
Great, did you install it?


[8/22/2022 11:45 PM] aryetis
Not yet but very soon ™️ I'll post some glamour shot when done.

[8/23/2022 4:41 PM] tux_linux
me too


[8/23/2022 4:41 PM] tux_linux
nheko seems like a nightmare to compile


[8/23/2022 4:41 PM] tux_linux
and to run

matrix is hackable as ... 
making a simple client would be easy


[8/23/2022 4:42 PM] tux_linux
probably


[8/23/2022 4:42 PM] szybet
without encryption but yes


[8/23/2022 4:42 PM] tux_linux
i once ran the official telegram client on my libra


[8/23/2022 4:42 PM] tux_linux

really well


[8/23/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
telegram is

bad


[8/23/2022 4:44 PM] szybet
worce than discord


[8/23/2022 4:44 PM] tux_linux
why


[8/23/2022 4:45 PM] szybet
better in privacy than fb? no
better for security than matrix? no
as many features as in discord? no

nheko is great I use it


[8/23/2022 6:13 PM] Deleted User
I talk to the guy who created it on a regular basis haha


[8/23/2022 6:14 PM] tux_linux
it might be great but not so great to cross-compile for an ereader

we could have a simple irc client on kobo


[8/23/2022 6:14 PM] Deleted User
there are various suckless irc clients that are a few hundred lines of c


[8/23/2022 6:15 PM] Deleted User
you could always use something like weechat


[8/23/2022 6:15 PM] Deleted User
that has a matrix addon


[8/23/2022 6:15 PM] Deleted User
its all terminal based so it should be fine


[8/23/2022 6:16 PM] szybet

[8/23/2022 9:44 PM] patchworkgarden
irc is ok


[8/23/2022 9:45 PM] patchworkgarden
i use irc and similar on pubnixes or the likr

[8/23/2022 9:47 PM] patchworkgarden
hell combined with something like bitlbee you can combine multiple protocols under just an irc client


[8/23/2022 9:48 PM] patchworkgarden
but first things first, getting an actual client running

weird question but I have a device that is supported and it says that it needs 4gb of space for the sd card


[8/24/2022 1:29 AM] Deleted User
what happens if I have less than that and try to dd the image


[8/24/2022 1:29 AM] Deleted User
it wont work I know but like what error message will show


[8/24/2022 1:29 AM] Deleted User
because I been trying it so far and like I just have the dd process running for like 30 mins now


[8/24/2022 1:29 AM] Deleted User

[8/24/2022 1:31 AM] Deleted User

[8/24/2022 1:31 AM] Deleted User
the device is the n905b


[8/24/2022 2:24 AM] Deleted User
anyway so I put an external 8gb card to the device and yeah finished dd into it but nothing happens


[8/24/2022 2:25 AM] Deleted User
it just tells me to please set up my ereader


[8/24/2022 2:36 AM] tux_linux
you need to replace the internal SD card

[8/24/2022 8:39 AM] szybet
because its c


[8/24/2022 8:39 AM] tux_linux
Like posix spawn doesn't want to wait for process


[8/24/2022 8:40 AM] tux_linux
Is fakePid an actually valid implementation?


[8/24/2022 8:40 AM] szybet
i think so?


[8/24/2022 8:40 AM] szybet
maybe the posix spawn in c has a diffrent usage


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] szybet
well syntax


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] szybet
but


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] szybet
there is wait for process below


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] szybet
you know?


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] szybet
can you show me the code?


[8/24/2022 8:41 AM] tux_linux
I don't know
I just have the feeling that waitpid isn't waiting on the right pid


[8/24/2022 8:42 AM] szybet
that wpuld create many zombie processes you know?


[8/24/2022 8:42 AM] szybet

if you wanna give it a try you can install it the hard way <https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-to-run-stable-diffusion-locally-to-generate-images/>
or pick one of the many "all included" package, eg for windows I use this one <https://grisk.itch.io/stable-diffusion-gui>

Get Stable Diffusion running on your AMD GPU without needing CUDA.
Note: Tested on Radeon RX68XX and 69XX series GPU's with Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and ArchLinux.  User reports indicate this method is working on several other GPU's including Radeon VII, Vega 56/64, 6700XT. Should theoretically work on RX470/480/570/580 GPU's with at least 8GB of ram ...

On my RTX 2070s depending of the setting I'd say i'm having in between 2.5 and 5 iteration/s


[8/26/2022 8:41 PM] aryetis
and it takes at least 50 iterations to get a descent results.


[8/26/2022 8:42 PM] aryetis
150 iterations being the point of diminishing return. The AI seems to go too abstract after that or focus on details too much.

There's also a version for stable-diffusion https://promptomania.com/stable-diffusion-prompt-builder/ but I'm not sure if `Stable Diffusion GRisk GUI 0.1` is passing the information correctly. I'd have to compare the results in between using the gui and command-line.

What freaks me out about stable-diffusion is that it's open-source
So no matter how good it is with invisible picture watermarking or NSFW content filter, people will always find workarounds and (possibly) lead to ... major ... society problems
This is probably the one and only time I'm saying a software should not have been released as open-source ^^


[8/29/2022 4:43 PM] szybet
thats what society needs to learn about, you wont avoid it with closed source software

simply every picture should be signed, to proof its truth from a legit source

something like nft but for veryfying truth and without a blockchain, and not scamming people

Some tool like that was inevitable. It was bound to happen one day or another. I think having it closed-source and therefore only accessible to one party/country/enterprise would have been even more worrying.


[8/29/2022 4:46 PM] tux_linux
well, yes and no


[8/29/2022 4:46 PM] aryetis
Now that it' s open, everyone is forced to acknowledge it and deal with it, learn how to recognize those images, etc

Honestly it's 2022 and I'm still baffled that there is no "digital hygiene" course of some sort.


[8/29/2022 4:47 PM] aryetis
Just like there should be "mental hygien" overall.


[8/29/2022 4:47 PM] tux_linux
will take another 50 years for it to be implemented...


[8/29/2022 4:47 PM] aryetis
Learn to think, learn to search, recognize dark pattern, recognize manipulation, etc

closing source is like in a space - level civilisation trying to avoid unauthorized star ships weapons

Take your notes with `vi` in a tty, instead of a graphical desktop. Maximum confusion from others looking over your shoulder.

[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] tux_linux
I used archinstall last time
messed up my whole drive


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
and i am VERY familiar with the arch installation process


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] tux_linux
couldn't understand the partition layout


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] szybet
what is archinstall?


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
this has NORTON installed on it...


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
why


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] the.mightydill
official arch guided installer

[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] tux_linux
suggestion: do a clean windows 11 install


[9/4/2022 11:03 PM] tux_linux
your pc can handle it


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
so this is a ryzen 7 5700U


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux
even if it may say it's not supported


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] szybet
why 11?...


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] szybet
do 10


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux
it **can** handle it


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
no i'm comfortable with 10


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] szybet
and unbloat it


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] szybet
get a pro n version


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
11 is unfamiliar


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux
the ideal would be: uninstall it completely


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
i have windows 10 home i think


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] tux_linux
but of course you have school


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] szybet
home is disgusting


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
honestly i just want functionality


[9/4/2022 11:04 PM] the.mightydill
for school


[9/4/2022 11:05 PM] the.mightydill
and arch isn't stable so i might just get ubuntu or fedora

I wouldn't even use arch (i did before)


[9/4/2022 11:31 PM] Deleted User
and don't go using artix either thats more cringe cause a lot of stuff won't work


[9/4/2022 11:32 PM] Deleted User
I would choose void over arch as it actually brings stuff to the table


[9/4/2022 11:32 PM] Deleted User
but albeit the install process would be more difficult than the just works arch

In 1985, a state-of-the-art radiation therapy device called the THERAC-25 started blasting holes through patients' bodies, leading to the world’s first death by radiation treatment overdose. It killed two more people before anyone knew what was going wrong. Why?

currently its only 1GB


[9/10/2022 6:58 PM] szybet

well maybe bigger images then?

on a side note i love it when our customers blame the hosting for something the webdev did with a htaccess file


[9/10/2022 8:59 PM] tux_linux

with the "storage" issue, for me to resolve that within windows without a arduino at the moment is 0% right ?


[9/10/2022 9:02 PM] tux_linux

via usb


[9/17/2022 7:14 PM] szybet
extract it, so there is a sanki folder and everything else inside it

yes

also @ManuXD32 if you can, build everything inside a debian docker container ( distrobox is cool ) to avoid problems


[9/17/2022 7:31 PM] szybet
yea... sad that the authour left


[9/17/2022 7:31 PM] manuxd32
Didn't know i could break something by compiling it outside a docker hahahah


[9/17/2022 7:32 PM] tux_linux
well, still around sometimes
and he was really invested into the Sony
like, more than I could ever be on any device
one day, I will get the courage to fix it


[9/17/2022 7:32 PM] szybet
i learned it the hard way. cross compiling is weird, it can cause problems from machine to machine


[9/17/2022 7:34 PM] szybet
still sad that he completly left the project after it


[9/17/2022 7:35 PM] tux_linux
as (almost) everyone does, but it was a record time
Daboone72 also stayed for somewhat long but never came back since ~feb 2022

so I am not saying that you are not welcome to be here, not at all, we are happy to help you but if you don't contribute or anything or leave it's a bit sad for us

[9/21/2022 3:48 PM] nonasuomy
Ideally it's generalized information


[9/21/2022 3:56 PM] nonasuomy
You can apply the information processes with pretty much dumping any firmware.


[9/21/2022 3:58 PM] nonasuomy
Hopefully they continue with the series


[9/21/2022 3:59 PM] nonasuomy

"they" is a common way to refer to someone in a genderless fashion. (disclaimer nothing to do with "woke" mindset, please don't start this debate). As I don't know if you're a guy/girl even tho I have strong suspicions I use "they".

as a non english native speaker, its confusing

gsm connection?


[9/27/2022 9:14 PM] szybet
the point is, another chip uses uart to communicate with the cpu

for the nia its bluetooth, but the chip isint soldered

[9/27/2022 9:57 PM] szybet
you have issues with suspending your app right?


[9/27/2022 9:58 PM] aryetis
yes


[9/27/2022 9:59 PM] szybet
why not leave it to the inkbox power daemon, and focus on whats truly matters :D?


[9/27/2022 9:59 PM] aryetis
That's on the roadmap ^^


[9/27/2022 10:00 PM] aryetis
Anyways, once in minicom "print screen" / ctrl A C should print a bunch of logs whenever I'm pressing buttons ?


[9/27/2022 10:00 PM] aryetis
cause now it's still dead silent


[9/27/2022 10:00 PM] szybet
its more complicated


[9/27/2022 10:01 PM] szybet
maybe now, focus on getting anything on the screen


[9/27/2022 10:01 PM] szybet
shut down your ereader / turn it on


[9/27/2022 10:01 PM] szybet
you should get u-boot logs on the screen


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] aryetis
wait isn't there something about the dialout user group


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] aryetis
damn it


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] aryetis
that might be it


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
obviously run it with sudo?...........


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
run it with root


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
the group might be uucp too


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
ls -l /dev to be sure


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] aryetis
meh if sudo is ok sure


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
maybe from bare root


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
to be sure


[9/27/2022 10:03 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[9/27/2022 10:04 PM] aryetis
I mean my uart usb interface is there 
`crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 sept. 27 22:01 /dev/ttyUSB0`


[9/27/2022 10:05 PM] szybet
at least this


[9/27/2022 10:05 PM] aryetis
but then nothing in minicom

nah, u-boot logs are in english


[9/27/2022 10:06 PM] szybet

I'm starting to question the damn uart dongle


[9/27/2022 10:08 PM] szybet
if its the one you send me, its okay


[9/27/2022 10:08 PM] szybet
you can try shorting rx to tx, then you will se your own messages


[9/27/2022 10:14 PM] aryetis
welp nothing when shorting rt to tx together


[9/27/2022 10:15 PM] szybet
toggle hardware flow in minicom


[9/27/2022 10:15 PM] aryetis
looks like I can buy another uart usb key


[9/27/2022 10:15 PM] aryetis
oh ok


[9/27/2022 10:18 PM] aryetis
still nothing


[9/27/2022 10:18 PM] szybet
try other program


[9/27/2022 10:18 PM] szybet
are you shorting only rx tx of the usb adapter?


[9/27/2022 10:19 PM] szybet
are the diodes on the usb - uart adapter even flickering?


[9/27/2022 10:19 PM] aryetis
No USB leds to check

it has no cristal oscilator


[9/27/2022 10:25 PM] szybet
that it shows up for the pc is a miracle already


[9/27/2022 10:26 PM] aryetis
I swear I've managed to flash OpenWRT with that """thing"""


[9/27/2022 10:26 PM] szybet
with what baud rate


[9/27/2022 10:26 PM] aryetis
don't remember that was years ago


[9/27/2022 10:26 PM] aryetis
anyways I'm off to amazon getting a new one


[9/27/2022 10:26 PM] szybet
try 1280 baud rate and then short the pins / try to type something


[9/27/2022 10:27 PM] szybet
if it doesnt work, toggle hardware flow once more


[9/27/2022 10:27 PM] szybet
if it still doesnt work, its trash

[9/27/2022 10:30 PM] szybet
showed up?


[9/27/2022 10:31 PM] aryetis
no i rage typed in it


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
when you're telling me to type something


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
you mean in another terminal ?


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] szybet
no, in this one


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
just to be extra sure


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
ok


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
so yeah I type ls in it


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] szybet
does klklkl show up even if you disconnect rx tx?


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
and then nothing so I spammed


[9/27/2022 10:32 PM] aryetis
nope


[9/27/2022 10:33 PM] aryetis
gonna short it right on the freaking board to be sure it's not the wires


[9/27/2022 10:34 PM] szybet
so it showed up only when they are connected?


[9/27/2022 10:34 PM] aryetis
it showed up when I type it in minicom


[9/27/2022 10:34 PM] aryetis
but it did nothing


[9/27/2022 10:35 PM] szybet
thats the point


[9/27/2022 10:35 PM] szybet
yes or no


[9/27/2022 10:35 PM] aryetis
yes it showed up when I typed it


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] aryetis
in the minicom console


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] aryetis
I type ls in minicom


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] aryetis
it shows up ls


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] szybet
so when you disconnect it, it doesnt show up?...


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] aryetis
that's indeed not happening if I'm not shorting things up


[9/27/2022 10:36 PM] aryetis
so shorting rt and tx allows me to type things in minicom


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] aryetis
so it's not totally dead yet


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
yes, its working


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
wow


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] aryetis
ok sorry


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] aryetis
really sorry


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
now try this with a higher baud rate


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
nah no need to be


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] aryetis
still shorting rx to tx ?


[9/27/2022 10:37 PM] szybet
yes


[9/27/2022 10:38 PM] aryetis
I can type using 115200


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] szybet
so its working


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] aryetis
gonna hook it back up to glo and see if I can type things


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] aryetis
then I'm gonna probably RTFM again


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] szybet
it will not work


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] aryetis
why ?


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] szybet
first get anything on the screen


[9/27/2022 10:39 PM] aryetis
ok


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] szybet
when you send a letter to kobo, kobo needs to send the latter back to you


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] szybet
the kobo doesnt seem to live


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] szybet
soo


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] szybet
try to reboot it when connected


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] aryetis
honestly it might have been responding and I was dumb


[9/27/2022 10:40 PM] aryetis
maybe I typed ls and expected it to respond when hitting enter


[9/27/2022 10:41 PM] szybet
if it was rebooting when you were connected, it should output a lot of thins


[9/27/2022 10:41 PM] szybet
you would notice that


[9/27/2022 10:42 PM] aryetis
ok


[9/27/2022 10:43 PM] aryetis
btw I rehooked it and the kobo responds, I can type things in minicom


[9/27/2022 10:43 PM] aryetis
it still only shows what I'm typing so it's useless


[9/27/2022 10:43 PM] aryetis
but it's something


[9/27/2022 10:45 PM] szybet
reboot the kobo


[9/27/2022 10:45 PM] szybet
with the power butto


[9/27/2022 10:48 PM] aryetis
led is blinking green but nothing shows up on the kobo screen


[9/27/2022 10:51 PM] aryetis
one reboot later it works again but still nothing shows up


[9/27/2022 10:51 PM] aryetis
one character showed up


[9/27/2022 10:53 PM] aryetis
I'm gonna stop spamming for now and read some manuals

next chapter tomorrow. I'm honestly worried that I've destroyed the pad with this iron.


[9/28/2022 12:40 AM] aryetis
so what you're saying is that J1 is definetly not the one to be used


[9/28/2022 12:40 AM] aryetis
I'm longing for that J5


[9/28/2022 12:41 AM] aryetis
but that's the one with a big gaping hole instead of a ground at this point. Not that it really matters there's ground everywhere


[9/28/2022 12:52 AM] aryetis
Also that ground wire wasn't shorting when placed face down. It looks like it s shorting there because I was holding it weirdly for the pic


[9/28/2022 12:53 AM] aryetis
Hopefully tomorrow will be better with proper gear. Otherwise I ll crack open the glo hd and move on to it


[9/28/2022 9:45 AM] aryetis

... nevermind now it does... I'm gonna resit the sd card ribbon (even tho it boots just fine when serial isn't connected) just to be safe and try to mess around with baudrate to get rid of those weird characters

So just for fun I wanted to try to make it work on my WSL2 setup. Because I like pain.
And turns out : 
1/ you still can't connect usb devices to WSL2 => solved, you can connect them through ip using usbipd  <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support>. Pretty easy.
2/ the debian kernel provided by microsoft does not have the `pl2303.ko` module required to use my specific USB-UART device. And you can't add compile and add modules to it. Therefore I have to recompile a kernel. 🤡 

I will not spam here about this don't worry. I just wanted to share my experience so far as I think I'm pretty much the only mad enough to use WSL2 around here. I'll come back to share if I succeeded. see ya all.

[9/28/2022 8:53 PM] aryetis
XD I know


[9/28/2022 8:53 PM] aryetis
I just want to see if it can be done.


[9/28/2022 10:14 PM] aryetis
That was quite easy actually.

Some instructions if someone crazy enough wants to give it a try somehow :
```
// Assuming you're already running a WSL2 (debian) 

//**************** How to serial connect in WSL2  ****************
1/ install usbipd on windows's side to share usb device through IP with WSL2, more info here : https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support

2/ install bunch of necessary software in WSL2 (might be some unnecessary ones depends of your needs, distrib) with : 
sudo apt install linux-tools-5.10 usbip hwdata usbutils usbserial setserial

3/ In some Admin Powershell (urgh), lis usb devices busids with : usbipd wsl list

4/ link usb device to WSL2 with usbipd wsl attach --busid [BUS_ID]

5/ check if /dev/ttyUSBxxx shows up. If not ... guess what ... WSL2 kernel probably doesn't have your device's driver. To be sure, check it out with ls -l /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers. You'll have to build your own kernel then.

//**************** How to build custom WSL2 kernel  ****************

1/ sudo apt install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev git dwarves

2/ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel.git

3/ cd WSL2-Linux-Kernel

4/ cp Microsoft/config-wsl .config (might as well change CONFIG_LOCALVERSION in it while you're at it so you can differentiate your kernel later on)

5/ Make menuconfig

6/ Enable your driver : Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB Serial Converter support -> [whatever device you're using]

7/ make -j xxx  (xxx being how many cores you want to build with)

8/ cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /mnt/c/[USER_NAME]/wsl_kernel

9/ Create the following file C:\Users\<UserName>\.wslconfig with this content : 
[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\Users\\aramir\\wsl_kernel

10/ in powershell/cmd wsl --shutdown (just to be sure)

11/ relaunch your WSL2 and check out your new kernel with : uname -a and voila !
```

If I had to do it from scratch it'd probably take me 20 minutes including kernel's compilation.


[9/28/2022 10:16 PM] aryetis
so 5 minutes following the instructions and 15 minutes sitting on my chair and watching youtube.


[9/28/2022 10:18 PM] aryetis
but honesty I discovered that  "make menuconfig" step during wsl2's kernel compilation have been quite eyes opening. I've seen ways to enable multiple things that I've been missing until now. So I'm glad I did it, I learned some things.

[9/28/2022 10:25 PM] aryetis
not really, but that's the only way to add driver (and other useful options) 
I don't usually mess around compiling my own kernel. I've probably done it 10 times max including when I add to compile Android's kernel.

I'm still reading and taking notes, I'll get my hands on a real device in a few days (probably three days from now). I definitely want to get involved in the implementation and testing for the Clara HD


[10/31/2022 4:18 PM] atro_atro
Just so you know, I tried some embedded programming a few times (but I'm far from good), I did study C++ and am a Rust developer as of now, I'm also a GNU/Linux user so I'm able to write bash


[10/31/2022 4:19 PM] atro_atro
I think that I can help but I may need some guidance


[10/31/2022 4:22 PM] atro_atro

[10/31/2022 6:35 PM] szybet
for 90% yes

kobo nia is cheap too, and its fully supportefd


[10/31/2022 6:36 PM] szybet
there simply were cases that we couldnt port inkbox to a device, it depends on many people so, if you want to contribute, then buy a device that already the low level stuff is done


[10/31/2022 6:36 PM] szybet
thats my opinion and suggestion, your decission can be diffrent


[10/31/2022 6:37 PM] atro_atro
Yes, Nia is cheaper than the Clara but the resolution is too low for my taste

Does this mean that once Kobo Clara is ported, other Kobo devices will be able to use the same kernel?

not the same, but use the same custom drivers / code

in a perfect scenario only the device tree and config would need to be changed

Hey folks. I used to be a lead of OpenInkpot project. Nice to see new project with "build from ground up" idea.

Hi, truly an honour to have you here. Would not have expected an ancient OpenInkpot developer at any time, it was a really great project


[11/3/2022 4:15 PM] dottedmag
Thanks. I look back at it with a bit of a shame, it was so mismanaged :)


[11/3/2022 4:15 PM] dottedmag
Anyway, after a long spell with Kindle I'm interested again in hacking on more open e-book readers.

wow cool


[11/3/2022 4:45 PM] szybet
so @tux-linux maybe buy another device?


[11/4/2022 12:10 AM] andi15701
with good chances the same kernel but different device tree. Configuration can be probably simplified, since kernel interfaces are more standard, e.g. clear patterns for button/led names, avoiding dealing with usb power supply falsely declared as battery (as in ntx 4.1.15 kernels) . And if configuration files are suffixed with a compatible string from /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/compatible, so they can coexist in the same image, so in the end we have waveform + uboot + devicetree as a difference in the device images.


[11/4/2022 12:10 AM] andi15701
some crazy idea I have:


[11/4/2022 12:17 AM] andi15701
what about creating an update file for kobos which puts them into that lowlevel download mode (by doing the ```eBR-1A # mw 20d8040 30
eBR-1A # mw 20d8044 10000000
reset
``` sequence via /dev/mem) once so then a uboot can be loaded which exposes the emmc/sdcard via usb, so backups can be done easily?

[11/4/2022 12:20 AM] andi15701
That is a bit less instrusive than that bootenv flash method I proposed for the Kobo Libra H2O


[11/4/2022 12:22 AM] andi15701
the update file could probably be created an such a way that it happens only once, so no permanent changes are done


[11/4/2022 12:22 AM] andi15701
downside is that a uboot configured for that task is needed


[11/4/2022 12:24 AM] szybet
thats the way i plan to inkbox be installed without dissasembling the device, with an installer that will exist... one day


[11/4/2022 12:27 AM] szybet
but how do you do that without everwriting uboot


[11/4/2022 12:29 AM] andi15701
well, that download mode is hardcoded in the SoC itself, uboot is then loaded from usb into ram


[11/4/2022 12:32 AM] andi15701
until now I triggered that download mode only from uboot cmdline


[11/4/2022 12:33 AM] andi15701
but yesterday I successfully triggered a similar mode on a omap4 device I am trying to hack via /dev/mem and rebooting via /proc/sysrq-trigger


[11/4/2022 12:44 PM] tux_linux
But then what about if this update goes wrong 😬


[11/4/2022 12:44 PM] tux_linux
Oh great
No MMC write


[11/4/2022 1:58 PM] szybet
are ntx cpus programmable? like they have a flash with settings or something


[11/4/2022 4:11 PM] aryetis
Yes please, non intrusive inkbox installation would give it a much bigger adoption rate.


[11/4/2022 4:35 PM] szybet
and im planning here to swap cpus on kindles to unlock them ;P


[11/4/2022 4:56 PM] andi15701
afaik they are programmable


[11/4/2022 4:56 PM] andi15701
the imx6sl (not the ll) support some kind of secure boot


[11/4/2022 4:57 PM] andi15701
so they can cryptographically check the bootloader and reject it


[11/4/2022 5:00 PM] andi15701
called High assurance boot


[11/4/2022 5:01 PM] szybet
yea, and replacing the cpu will fix the problem?

unsigned bootloaders This requirements can be lifted on devices with the following System On a Chip, if they were made before July 2017: 
NXP I.MX6 Quad

NXP I.MX6 UltraLite
NXP I.MX6 ULL

This is because such chip contains a hardware security flaw enabling to execute your code nevertheless.

CVE-2017-7932)


[11/4/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
```
it is possible to bypass the signature verification by using a specially crafted certificate leading to the execution of an unsigned image.
```


[11/4/2022 5:13 PM] szybet
i think swapping the cpu would be easier ;p


[11/4/2022 5:14 PM] andi15701
depends on your skills


[11/4/2022 5:14 PM] andi15701
and the amount of devices


[11/4/2022 5:14 PM] andi15701
you need to create such a certificate once


[11/4/2022 5:15 PM] andi15701
but you need to swap cpus on every device


[11/4/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
cpu swap will work on every one


[11/4/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
and this, not really


[11/4/2022 5:18 PM] szybet
also i plan this only as a proof of concept to free a ereader


[11/4/2022 5:19 PM] szybet
and a opportunity to solder some big bga chips


[11/4/2022 5:24 PM] andi15701
well, I think you need only one certificate per chip type


[11/4/2022 5:25 PM] andi15701
so if there is a proper installation process, people repeat it without soldering skills


[11/4/2022 5:59 PM] andi15701
well, if the cpu is old enough


[11/4/2022 6:00 PM] andi15701
but please, before soldering something new in, try to find out as many connections as possible


[11/4/2022 6:00 PM] andi15701
so everything wihch can be more easily figured out without cpu


[11/4/2022 6:28 PM] szybet
sure


[11/4/2022 6:29 PM] szybet
but in the far future


[11/5/2022 1:44 PM] tux_linux
you forgot one factor: average human stupidity


[11/5/2022 1:48 PM] szybet
i dont expect anyone to swap out a bga cpu


[11/5/2022 1:48 PM] szybet
but in theory every laptop repair service could do it if you ask gently, they have special bga swap machines

Ahahah, yeah I usually go with the USB adapter because I'm scared of the SD card getting stuck


[11/19/2022 5:58 PM] the.mightydill
oh yeah that's why i use a usb adapter as well

[11/19/2022 6:00 PM] atro_atro
I only opened the back for now, do I also need screwdrivers to open everything or is it okay, I can already see the 4 pins where I'll probably have to connect the serial-usb

so dd if=/dev/sdX of=kobo-image.img  (where X is replaced by the letter for your sdcard reader).  losetup -r -P -f backup.img produces some /dev/loopXp1 and so on and that can be mounted?

[11/30/2022 10:53 PM] andi15701
just a side note: I trying to convince the bt200 (not an ebook reader) to accept newer stuff (it has Android 4.0.4).  It  has eMMC and uSD, I try to keep the eMMC mostly intact and put the new stuff on uSD. It is a bit hacking unfriendly. I need to short a soldering jumper to have access to u-boot over 1.8V serial or have any serial output on standard kernel. I had the impression, that it would boot from USB, UART and then uSD if eMMC fails. But I wanted to "dry-test" it before,  So what did I: I put a 470 ohm resistor between the DAT0 line of the eMMC and ground. That was enough so that the eMMC could not be properly detected. So I could check whether the boot order was as expected


[11/30/2022 10:55 PM] andi15701
luckily I even did not need to solder it, because DAT0 was available at a via. the wired resistor got some hold there


[11/30/2022 10:56 PM] andi15701
That might also be a recovery option for some ebook readers without uSD, but you have to find the lines...


[11/30/2022 11:23 PM] szybet
So in short: you disabled the emmc so it would boot from other things?


[11/30/2022 11:24 PM] andi15701
yes


[11/30/2022 11:25 PM] szybet
i also thought about it, but whats the point of it when you cant overwrite the eemc then


[11/30/2022 11:26 PM] andi15701
disable it temporarlly until bootloader from uSD starts


[11/30/2022 11:26 PM] szybet
uSD?


[11/30/2022 11:26 PM] andi15701
or USB


[11/30/2022 11:26 PM] andi15701
or whatever recovery option there is


[11/30/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
if you disable it, it will wait for another recovery and then it will wait for it, and you can reenable the eemc?


[11/30/2022 11:27 PM] andi15701
yes


[11/30/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
wow


[11/30/2022 11:27 PM] szybet
cool


[11/30/2022 11:28 PM] szybet
i though the eemc wouldn't work after that


[11/30/2022 11:28 PM] andi15701
it must be  working at probing time


[11/30/2022 11:29 PM] andi15701
so the boot rom in the SoC probes it, u-boot probes it, the kernel probes it


[11/30/2022 11:29 PM] szybet
good then


[11/30/2022 11:29 PM] szybet
but on most devices we dont know the pinout


[11/30/2022 11:30 PM] szybet
what about cutting a pcb line, to make it not working? of course not GND and VCC because it would be bad, but some others


[11/30/2022 11:31 PM] andi15701
depends on what is available, here it might be sufficient to short GND+VCC, because separate regulator and short-circuit proof


[11/30/2022 11:31 PM] szybet
apart from that that a bit of solder on the data line can make it go *woooo* because of fast speed transfers...


[11/30/2022 11:31 PM] andi15701
thet main point is getting information out of it


[11/30/2022 11:31 PM] szybet
we dont know if there is a short protection too


[11/30/2022 11:32 PM] andi15701
well, you have to do some research before doing too risky opertions


[11/30/2022 11:33 PM] andi15701
here I played around with pullup/down settings


[11/30/2022 11:33 PM] andi15701

Hey!


[12/11/2022 2:52 PM] szybet
What is your goal here? 😄


[12/11/2022 5:25 PM] slalamander
Ahh I bought a cheap ereader myself, in part for use with home assistant. I saw someone mention it in regards to inkbox, and after trying it out (I have a tolino shine, but it's analogous to a Kobo Glo) I really liked inkbox. At least here so I don't forget to update, but perhaps if needed I'm keen to do some testing on my device as well :)


[12/11/2022 5:39 PM] szybet
you are the guy from mobile read forums?


[12/11/2022 5:40 PM] szybet
well for testing your initiative is needed


[12/11/2022 5:40 PM] szybet
you would need to compile inkbox for root edition, and then compile things when developers want you to test


[12/11/2022 5:42 PM] szybet
i can create for you a Tester role if you want, but i doubt you will want to do it, its a lot of work ( well it depends, just software testing ), and 95% of people give up


[12/11/2022 5:43 PM] szybet
as for updating inkbox, there are a lot things in mainline and not in 2.0, so if you want the latest version you need to compile them yourself ( there are A LOT of things ), if you want to test, start with 2.0 features


[12/11/2022 7:41 PM] slalamander
Ah no that was someone else haha


[12/11/2022 7:42 PM] slalamander
I think for testing in that case I may not be the right person indeed 😅 At least, for testing more of the backend stuff. If needed I can at least try images out on my device tho :)

well first you need to compile inkbox for yourself, i can instruct you on #quill how to do it, after that i can give you the role


[12/11/2022 9:15 PM] slalamander
Is it okay to do that tomorrow? It's a bit too late for me right now to still get started with that 😅


[12/11/2022 9:19 PM] szybet
its a long process for unexperienced people, it will take time


[12/11/2022 9:20 PM] szybet
also i dont have time 24/7, so its okay, its just important to not give up


[12/11/2022 9:20 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[12/11/2022 10:30 PM] slalamander
If you have time tonight, I suppose a basic set of starting points/resources can help me get started tomorrow, and I'll update you on how far I get


[12/11/2022 10:30 PM] szybet
i dont


[12/11/2022 10:30 PM] szybet
but


[12/11/2022 10:31 PM] szybet
look up #porting clara hd thread, it says a bit about porting not testing, but still the knowledge **links** there are usefull


[12/11/2022 10:31 PM] szybet
also in #chat and #quill was a guy who compiled inkbox for himself, i cant remember, but tux-linux helped him do it

here, here is the guy


[12/11/2022 10:34 PM] szybet
the steps are indentical almost, but you dont need to partition the sd card for example, just the kernel and rootfs


[12/11/2022 10:34 PM] szybet
feel free to ask me at #quill even if im not active, i will answer as soon as i can

[12/24/2022 2:00 PM] tux_linux
@Szybet ideas?


[12/24/2022 2:04 PM] szybet
for this christmas? how are you supposed to ship it


[12/24/2022 2:05 PM] tux_linux
For future Christmases


[12/24/2022 2:05 PM] tux_linux
Something that would only show on 25th of December


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] szybet
the app menu could have a diffrent icon composed of stars for christmas, or eggs for... the second one


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] szybet
for now its only dots


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] tux_linux
Oh I know


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] szybet
and maybe for a long click ( 2s ) a message would appear


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] tux_linux
I will replace the home icon by a Christmas tree


[12/24/2022 2:07 PM] tux_linux
Yes that too probably


[12/24/2022 2:08 PM] szybet
well thats my idea but


[12/24/2022 2:08 PM] szybet
well lets replace all icons with similar ones but themed


[12/24/2022 2:08 PM] tux_linux
You can implement it
Just follow code standards and icon sizes (512x512) and I will accept it


[12/24/2022 2:09 PM] tux_linux
It can be just one icon or many ones


[12/24/2022 2:09 PM] szybet
i have diffrent priorities... but sure, i will write it on the second to do list

{Reactions}
👍 

[12/24/2022 2:10 PM] tux_linux
Would have been cool to see it for Christmas but anyways I understand


[12/24/2022 2:10 PM] szybet
no chance to ship it today


[12/24/2022 2:11 PM] tux_linux
Then maybe I will do it
I've got to fix init first though


[12/24/2022 2:11 PM] szybet
i mean, you wont make a release today


[12/24/2022 2:12 PM] tux_linux
C is a bit like Qt: sometimes something randomly breaks on one device and segfaults the program and you're never able to figure out why, so you implement questionable alternatives

Yesterday I spent almost half an hour trying to wake up my Kindle which seemed stuck somewhere between being alive and dead


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
Then I connected it to serial and magic, it worked


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] szybet
did u-boot work?


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
Not sure


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] tux_linux
Now it does


[12/24/2022 2:18 PM] szybet
disconnect the battery / check serial


[12/24/2022 2:18 PM] szybet
the first things to check


[12/24/2022 2:18 PM] tux_linux
A bit complicated to disconnect the battery in there I think


[12/24/2022 2:18 PM] szybet
nah


[12/24/2022 2:20 PM] szybet
it happened again after second going to sleep

we have already sketch ( rusty ), and i will integrate it into a qt app that will be a notebook

how will you do that

[12/28/2022 3:29 PM] szybet
the qt whiteboard will be horrible anyway


[12/28/2022 3:29 PM] szybet
do you remember why we dropped sketch ( qt ) ?


[12/28/2022 3:31 PM] tux_linux
because you said it was horrible?


[12/28/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
no


[12/28/2022 3:32 PM] szybet
because it was horrible


[12/28/2022 3:32 PM] szybet

[12/28/2022 3:33 PM] tux_linux
that's why i was searching for alternatives yesterday (today)


[12/28/2022 3:34 PM] szybet
qtpaint is not working great, thats a fact


[12/28/2022 3:34 PM] szybet
and you cant avoid that


[12/28/2022 3:34 PM] szybet
what will happen with the sketch app now? will you replace it with rusty one, and on kindle say "sorry no"?


[12/28/2022 3:34 PM] tux_linux
there are better ones


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
that's why I was searching for alternatives


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] szybet
as good as platos?


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
well, depends on the PoV


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
but certainly better than qtsketch


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
scribble


[12/28/2022 3:35 PM] tux_linux
i think


[12/28/2022 3:36 PM] szybet
until you figure out something more smooth than platos, i **want**  it to be used at default


[12/28/2022 3:37 PM] tux_linux
it won't until it actually exists 😉


[12/28/2022 3:37 PM] szybet
what?


[12/28/2022 3:38 PM] tux_linux
well you haven't programmed the app yet


[12/28/2022 3:38 PM] szybet
it is there


[12/28/2022 3:38 PM] szybet
in the future, for now we have bare plato's sketch


[12/28/2022 3:38 PM] szybet

nooo, because 1 i cant, you are the fork and 2 we had completly separate code 3 i cant make a pr to a fork


[12/28/2022 3:50 PM] tux_linux
then can you submit a patch that will work for this repo?


[12/28/2022 3:50 PM] tux_linux
thanks


[12/28/2022 3:50 PM] szybet
not really


[12/28/2022 3:51 PM] szybet
just discard your commits and pull the changes


[12/28/2022 3:51 PM] szybet
for the future the main repo should be on the inkbox organisation, this is now a mess


[12/28/2022 3:51 PM] tux_linux

[12/28/2022 3:52 PM] tux_linux
i can't discard my commits

[12/28/2022 3:52 PM] szybet
pull changes from main repo


[12/28/2022 3:52 PM] szybet
it will overwrite


[12/28/2022 3:52 PM] tux_linux
but how do you expect it to work like before if it isn't even the same code inside


[12/28/2022 3:57 PM] szybet
from what i can remember there was a overwrite / discard commit button


[12/28/2022 3:57 PM] szybet
idk, just copy the code then


[12/28/2022 4:03 PM] tux_linux
can you try to submit a patch for it today? I wanted to work on lockscreen


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
what im supposed to do


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
get your repo, overwrite your code with mine, send a patch?


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] tux_linux
take the main repo and try to integrate your changes


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] tux_linux
yes, sort of


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
thats stupid a bit


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] szybet
just copy the code?...


[12/28/2022 4:04 PM] tux_linux
we also don't have the same commits


[12/28/2022 4:05 PM] tux_linux
i think you are going to run into more issues


[12/28/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
not really, the patch will ignore everything else


[12/28/2022 4:05 PM] szybet
also if we want to resolve this, the fork needs then


[12/28/2022 4:08 PM] tux_linux
needs what?


[12/28/2022 4:09 PM] szybet
pull changes, overwrite, something


[12/28/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
well, yes, and this is what you should have done since the beginning


[12/28/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
before starting to work on it


[12/28/2022 4:10 PM] tux_linux
i will add it to code standards


[12/28/2022 4:12 PM] szybet
i cant im from the main repooooo


[12/28/2022 4:12 PM] szybet
i cant make a pr, or pull changes from a fork


[12/28/2022 4:12 PM] szybet
the fork needs to make a pull request

it will ask you to merge or smth


[12/28/2022 4:18 PM] szybet
yea


[12/28/2022 4:18 PM] szybet
and it will be a mess


[12/28/2022 4:18 PM] tux_linux
it is already a mess


[12/28/2022 4:18 PM] tux_linux
otherwise, integrate changes manually


[12/28/2022 4:19 PM] szybet
it will be more


[12/28/2022 4:19 PM] szybet

might be the best option


[12/28/2022 4:20 PM] szybet
but you need to use my code


[12/28/2022 4:20 PM] szybet
not i yours


[12/28/2022 4:21 PM] tux_linux
then maybe just start with my repo, inspect yours for changes that aren't there (shouldn't be long, it's just one rust file) and change what you need to


[12/28/2022 4:21 PM] tux_linux
to be sure you didn't commit a merge, delete your repo locally and clone it again


[12/28/2022 4:22 PM] szybet
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo


[12/28/2022 4:22 PM] szybet
i looked up your repo, mine, integrated both, added new and it works


[12/28/2022 4:22 PM] szybet
its the final code


[12/28/2022 4:22 PM] szybet
nothing to change

Happy new year everyone
May 2023 bring you more things that work instead of ones that you need to reverse engineer or rewrite to make work...
(Yes, thinking about you, Qt)

When it comes to getting a kernel for inkbox built for a new device what are the main roadblocks?


[1/9/2023 5:25 PM] tux_linux
not only the kernel...


[1/9/2023 5:25 PM] tux_linux
everything? almost?


[1/9/2023 5:26 PM] tux_linux
how much knowledge do you have in linux things?


[1/9/2023 5:26 PM] szybet
getting? you mean preparing from a new device?


[1/9/2023 5:26 PM] szybet
if so, tux-linux has this knowledge but doesn't shared it

I will tell you a little story : 90% of people who want to port InkBox to their devices surrender at some point or just disappear like it never happened

I mentioned inkbox  to him in another server and found this server and linked it to him


[1/9/2023 5:31 PM] szybet
hmm cool


[1/9/2023 5:34 PM] beaglebark
I'm guessing that inkbox runs a newer version of the kernel  than what the devices originally shipped with,  in the case of the libra 2 being a newer device than the ones that are currently supported would that make things more difficult or easier in that case?


[1/9/2023 5:34 PM] tux_linux
it's often the same kernel but modified a bit


[1/9/2023 5:35 PM] beaglebark
And as far as I can tell the kobo kernel  sources do not have commit histories which is fun


[1/9/2023 5:35 PM] tux_linux
for Kindle Touch (a 2011?) device, I had to fake 2.6.35 version while it was 2.6.31 actually, but I also had to backport things such as devtmpfs support and ppoll syscall to make it work with the existing system

[1/20/2023 2:20 PM] szybet
Looking for nia image?


[1/20/2023 2:21 PM] tea_bot_
I was, I mean I am, but i could not help but notice that you are working on an... OS(?) that would run on kobo HW ?


[1/20/2023 2:22 PM] tea_bot_
some kind of software to put on the HW at least. Cards on the table I'm not super good with software.


[1/20/2023 2:23 PM] tea_bot_
I am however an electronics tech so i can understand and do basic things at least


[1/20/2023 2:23 PM] tea_bot_
just more of a HW guy


[1/20/2023 2:23 PM] tea_bot_
I've got a Nia that was stuck in some kind of boot loop after an update


[1/20/2023 2:24 PM] tea_bot_
i took out the SD card but its now lost. For... reasons


[1/20/2023 2:24 PM] tea_bot_
So Ive got HW empty of soft


[1/20/2023 2:25 PM] tea_bot_
I'm willing to try some shenanigans to get some other soft than the original one running on it. I just don't know how trustworthy the HW is.


[1/20/2023 2:26 PM] tea_bot_
it was working before i took out the SD so I'm hopeful


[1/20/2023 2:27 PM] andi15701
does it appear on the USB bus?


[1/20/2023 2:27 PM] andi15701
without SD card


[1/20/2023 2:27 PM] andi15701
or empty sd cad


[1/20/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
with an empty i think? what would it show without any sd card


[1/20/2023 2:33 PM] andi15701
with nothing which looks like a bootloaer, it should show the raw hid device specific to IMX processors


[1/20/2023 2:34 PM] andi15701
regardsless whether card is in or not


[1/20/2023 2:34 PM] andi15701
just to do some basic hardware check


[1/20/2023 2:34 PM] andi15701
before proceeding


[1/20/2023 2:36 PM] tea_bot_
So when I plug it in I've got zero reaction from the HW. No lights no nothing not sure if that is supposed to be the case without sd.
How do I go and check this on windows? Where do i look?


[1/20/2023 2:37 PM] andi15701
check wether something in the device manager appears


[1/20/2023 2:38 PM] andi15701
lights are software-controlled, so there need to be some software setting it on


[1/20/2023 2:40 PM] tea_bot_
Not seeing anything change in the device manager


[1/20/2023 2:41 PM] szybet
well i would now:
- measure power consumption on usb
- connect serial, if no sd card is attached, the cpu on boot splits out a single 0 bit


[1/20/2023 2:41 PM] szybet
to see if cpu is alive


[1/20/2023 2:41 PM] tea_bot_
That makes sense actually.


[1/20/2023 2:42 PM] tea_bot_
Ah, so upon plugging it in, it sends a 0 bit on the Tx pin then?


[1/20/2023 2:42 PM] andi15701
the is also a boot rom in the SoC controlling the boot process, so that would be what loads stuff from sd card or start the usb recovery mode


[1/20/2023 2:43 PM] andi15701
probably press power button for 15s to turn it off


[1/20/2023 2:43 PM] szybet
after clicking power button if its off


[1/20/2023 2:45 PM] tea_bot_
So even without sd i should see some sort of activity when I turn it on or off ?


[1/20/2023 2:45 PM] szybet
the one we described, yes


[1/20/2023 2:47 PM] tea_bot_
Because the thing is white screen and didn't react whatsoever to the button press back when it was working. The button is broken and I've soldered two wires that I'm connecting together to simulate press. 
Am i wrong in assuming the button was a NO that just connected both side upon press?


[1/20/2023 2:47 PM] tea_bot_
Sorry for being a dumb dumb guys, I'm fairly new to tinkering like this


[1/20/2023 2:49 PM] szybet
did it worked with those wires


[1/20/2023 2:50 PM] tea_bot_
Nope, same as with the button when it clicked, no visible reaction from the thing


[1/20/2023 2:50 PM] tea_bot_
I'll have to try and measure the USB cable and see if I can catch something on serial


[1/20/2023 2:57 PM] tea_bot_
How hard is it to transfer a Nia Image with the stock Kobo SW ? Cause that'd tell us right quick if the HW is okay or not


[1/20/2023 3:10 PM] szybet
nia image? you mean inkbox?


[1/20/2023 3:16 PM] tea_bot_
No I mean the original soft on the Nia, if you've got a backup, and if it's not too much work to send it to me, i could flash another sd i have and try it


[1/20/2023 3:21 PM] tea_bot_
Maybe inkbox would work. Just a software that would make it so the power button will visibly turn it on and off so that we can see if it works. Not sure I'm being clear lol


[1/20/2023 3:29 PM] szybet
first, make a backup ofyour original sd card just to be sure


[1/20/2023 3:29 PM] tea_bot_
I'm gonna use another SD card, the original one is... Safe but unavailable


[1/20/2023 3:30 PM] szybet
second, i dont have time today to send you my image, so if you want grab inkbox 1.9 image and flash it


[1/20/2023 3:31 PM] szybet
well on the original sd card are unique things for your device, so dont lose it


[1/20/2023 3:33 PM] tea_bot_
I won't lose it, it is stuck between the SD slot and the frame of one of my computers. 
Turns out the slot wasn't properly centered and when I pushed in the card i did not check properly... It slid nicely into the PC. It hasn't moved so it's not going anywhere


[1/20/2023 3:34 PM] tea_bot_
Oh there is no hurry, sorry if I gave the impression! I'll grab the inkbox 1.9 tonight and try that


[1/20/2023 3:34 PM] tea_bot_
Thank you both for your help, i really appreciate it


[1/20/2023 3:35 PM] tea_bot_
If the Nia is still alive i'd be happy to help for Kobo related endeavors and use it to test things if y'all need !


[1/20/2023 3:38 PM] szybet
Hmmm


[1/20/2023 3:38 PM] szybet
there is a mainline kernel ready for testing for the Nia


[1/20/2023 3:38 PM] szybet
a bit risky it is, could burn thr device


[1/20/2023 3:41 PM] tea_bot_
Intense! Why would it burn ?


[1/20/2023 3:41 PM] tea_bot_
Anyhow, if my Nia is alive i can test that maybe


[1/20/2023 3:42 PM] tea_bot_
Would it damage the SD ? Or is it only the chip at risk ?


[1/20/2023 3:42 PM] szybet
wrong voltages on power regulators


[1/20/2023 3:42 PM] szybet
everything


[1/20/2023 3:44 PM] tea_bot_
Oh my, yeah that sounds like a good way to fry everything


[1/20/2023 3:48 PM] tea_bot_
Are y'all familiar with Linux ?


[1/20/2023 3:49 PM] szybet
yes


[1/20/2023 3:49 PM] tea_bot_
I've got a Chromebook set with Lubuntu, and I've been using etcher on it to flash SD, USB etc.. is there a simpler, command line way to do it?


[1/20/2023 3:49 PM] szybet
dd


[1/20/2023 3:50 PM] szybet
but i like gnome disks gui


[1/20/2023 3:50 PM] tea_bot_
Okay thanks, i'll look into that


[1/20/2023 3:54 PM] tea_bot_
Ah this looks like something that'll help me. Managing all disks sounds good. Thanks !

@TeaBot
I am the principal maintainer of this project, if you want to know who I am
Here's a download link for 1.9 : http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/n306/inkbox-1.9-n306.xz
With my help (and probably @Szybet's too) you should update it to 2.0 development version ASAP
1.9 is terribly outdated


[1/20/2023 6:30 PM] tux_linux
`xzcat inkbox-1.9-n306.xz | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress`
Assuming `mmcblk0` is your SD card's device node
This image runs a modified stock Kobo kernel, so there shouldn't be any problems with voltage regulators


[1/20/2023 6:52 PM] szybet
ummm for now he could just check if it works

[1/20/2023 7:38 PM] tea_bot_
Hello! Nice to meet ya.
I'm interested in trying the project for sure ! So far the question of the HW status is still very much open, I'm trying to find a easy-ish way to get it do something if it's still operational. I'm gonna try the 1.9, and see if the HW is ok 🙂

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/20/2023 9:44 PM] tea_bot_
Aaaaaand it doesn't work


[1/20/2023 9:44 PM] tea_bot_
I think the power supply hw is dead


[1/20/2023 9:44 PM] tea_bot_
The thing doesn't turn on whatsoever


[1/20/2023 9:48 PM] tea_bot_
I successfully flashed a sd with inkbox 1.9


[1/20/2023 10:04 PM] andi15701
hmm, one try : disconnect battery and try usb plug in again


[1/20/2023 10:04 PM] andi15701
no sd card


[1/21/2023 9:07 AM] tea_bot_
Nevermind I'm dumb, it does work


[1/21/2023 9:07 AM] tea_bot_
I un plugged the battery, plugged it back in and connected USB. I connected my cables together and it turned on


[1/21/2023 9:08 AM] tea_bot_
Just did the setup, had kobox activated and now it's showing me an empty library


[1/21/2023 9:08 AM] tea_bot_
Great success, thank you so much for your help


[1/21/2023 9:09 AM] tea_bot_
I didn't exactly do that but thanks for the inspiration for battery unplugging to start off anew


[1/21/2023 9:23 AM] tea_bot_
So, i originally planned to give it to my wife once it works. 
I'm willing to help y'all do some testing, cause I'm no developer but I'd be sad if we fried the thing when testing


[1/21/2023 9:24 AM] tea_bot_
I gotta say i like the UI on this thing


[1/21/2023 9:24 AM] tea_bot_
Straightforward, clean


[1/21/2023 9:25 AM] tea_bot_
Is it compatible with Calibre ?


[1/21/2023 9:25 AM] tea_bot_
Or is it drag&drop to put books on it


[1/21/2023 9:43 AM] tea_bot_
Ah it says connected to computer but windows doesn't see it.


[1/21/2023 10:39 AM] tea_bot_
Mmh linux doesn't see it either, there must be some kind of kink to work out

[1/21/2023 10:51 AM] andi15701
I get something like that on devices without SD card


[1/21/2023 10:52 AM] andi15701
I would expect to see something similar on the Nia


[1/21/2023 10:52 AM] andi15701
so, maybe you have a problem with usb data lines (in the cable, in one of the sockets or plugs)


[1/21/2023 11:07 AM] tea_bot_
Dang, maybe both cables ive got right now are just power lines. I noticed that it said detection of computer when I plugged into the wall to charge battery. So it recognize power line, not data


[1/21/2023 11:07 AM] tea_bot_
I'll try and find other cables


[1/21/2023 6:50 PM] tea_bot_
Okay i found a cable that works managed to put two epubs on it


[1/21/2023 7:56 PM] tea_bot_
So there was question of a version 2.0? Because obviously my HW works


[1/21/2023 8:01 PM] tea_bot_
@tux-linux


[1/21/2023 8:43 PM] andi15701
does the device appear on usb without sdcard? It is not important for the nia itself, but good to have a clear picture of recovery options, especially for devices with just internal eMMC. So if that door is for some reason closed at any kobo device it is good to be alert for trouble. So in summary: for science


[1/21/2023 8:44 PM] szybet

[1/21/2023 8:50 PM] tea_bot_
And sorry for pinging


[1/21/2023 8:50 PM] szybet
its not ready, but there are many improvements


[1/21/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
so if you want it, you need to recompile everything yourself


[1/21/2023 8:51 PM] tea_bot_
I will check without SD, see where i stand. I'll let you know what I find

[1/21/2023 8:55 PM] szybet
i learned almost everything from scratch, its just about dedication


[1/21/2023 9:00 PM] tea_bot_
Yeah, i just gotta look at it enough that it snaps into place and starts making sense to me. I've got HW know-how so i just have to link it to the firmware and software


[1/21/2023 9:00 PM] tea_bot_
Or rather look into the hardware so that i understand what the soft is doing


[1/21/2023 9:15 PM] szybet
here are 2 types of people:
1. one that will solder even spider heresy to make it work
2. the group that refuses to solder anything, even serial wires

no middle ground, so no help is needed in case of hardware


[1/21/2023 9:15 PM] szybet
also as you have a nia and into hardware, i share this:
https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio

[1/21/2023 9:26 PM] szybet
i mean, low level software + hardware is needed most of the time

you also have seen that on the Libra H2O when we experimented with bootloader


[1/23/2023 12:57 PM] andi15701
some words about all that regulator stuff: Settings vary not too much between readers with same SoC, just because the specifications of the regulators meet specific use cases, of course everyone would use the dcdc regulators for the cpu, and things must match with the initial power-up state, so that at least the cpu runs to execute code that can configure regulators.


[1/23/2023 12:57 PM] andi15701
but there is always a little risk remaining


[1/23/2023 12:58 PM] andi15701

[1/23/2023 9:45 PM] andi15701
I bought a tolino vision second hand


[1/23/2023 9:45 PM] andi15701
interesting is that it has internal eMMC


[1/23/2023 9:45 PM] andi15701
and also an accessible uSD slot


[1/23/2023 9:46 PM] andi15701
I have not checked yet boot order, but if that uSD slot has priority over eMMC


[1/23/2023 9:46 PM] andi15701
than anything can be booted without opening the case


[1/23/2023 9:47 PM] andi15701
but what is strange: usb


[1/23/2023 9:47 PM] andi15701
connecting to usb while running the stock system


[1/23/2023 9:47 PM] andi15701
mass storage appears shortly


[1/23/2023 9:47 PM] andi15701
than disappears


[1/23/2023 9:48 PM] andi15701
and will not appear again until I reload xhci_pci module on the host


[1/23/2023 9:48 PM] andi15701
nor fastboot will


[1/23/2023 9:48 PM] andi15701
after that module reloading things are better


[1/23/2023 9:49 PM] andi15701
I can access fastboot


[1/23/2023 9:50 PM] andi15701
and than happily boot mainline and load debian via nfs via usb network


[1/23/2023 9:50 PM] andi15701
without any trouble


[1/23/2023 9:56 PM] andi15701
until I agan try to communicate with the stock system


[1/23/2023 9:56 PM] andi15701

Hey @Szybet, when you have time, could i trouble you for the Nia stock software image? I'd like to get it in the hand of someone who archives all model to help other people on the mobile read forum. I see a lot of people looking for one. Lemme know if you're too busy and I'll look for it somewhere else


[1/24/2023 9:38 AM] szybet
i will provide it in the weekend


[1/24/2023 9:39 AM] szybet
but first i will overwrite the serial number there


[1/24/2023 9:39 AM] szybet
well find a way i can send you it, its 7GB i think


[1/24/2023 9:40 AM] szybet
also you will need to flash it and clean it, there are my books🥴


[1/24/2023 10:11 AM] tea_bot_
Yeah. It's a big boy. Compressed archive maybe ? 
I will flash it and clean it, no worries. Will do a factory reset and make an image of that


[1/24/2023 10:11 AM] tea_bot_
Is there something I need to modify with the serial number? Or is a dummy SN good to go?


[1/24/2023 10:12 AM] andi15701
there are tools to zero-out empty space


[1/24/2023 10:12 AM] andi15701
then it would be more compressible


[1/24/2023 10:12 AM] andi15701
e.g. data partition should be compressable to almost zero


[1/24/2023 10:27 AM] szybet
i will do it


[1/24/2023 10:27 AM] szybet
it is already compressed wirh xz


[1/24/2023 10:29 AM] tea_bot_
Oof that's a swol archive


[1/24/2023 10:29 AM] tea_bot_
Mmh i'm not sure how to do the transfer, gotta think for a minute


[1/24/2023 10:32 AM] andi15701
well, to make things small, create a file full of zeros on each partition and delete it afterwards, and then compress the image


[1/24/2023 12:18 PM] szybet
hey, just let them install inkbox ;p


[1/24/2023 12:44 PM] tea_bot_
Lol would probably be simpler tbf


[1/24/2023 1:09 PM] szybet

@Szybet i might have found a Nia Image somewhere else! If you haven't already done some stuff regarding transferring, hold off; if it works I'll send it to the forum and you won't need to do anything


[1/27/2023 9:13 AM] szybet
i didnt do anything yet, i said in the weekend


[1/27/2023 9:13 AM] szybet
sure


[1/27/2023 9:40 AM] tea_bot_
I know, just making sure that nothing was started just in case. Thanks!


[1/27/2023 6:44 PM] tea_bot_
@Szybet well no luck on the Nia Image lead. So whenever you've got time, be it this weekend or later, I'd test it and send it on to the forum


[1/27/2023 6:45 PM] szybet
im short on time actually... we will see


[1/27/2023 6:46 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[1/27/2023 6:47 PM] tea_bot_
No worries, if you don't have the time for it, you don't 🙂 maybe some other time if i can't find one elsewhere

@NiLuJe you worked with einks, those ports are available? like on mouser / digikey?

not hd, it's rakuten branded


[1/30/2023 10:45 PM] tux_linux
There's a diagonal unequal line
It's not a port problem

but in Belgium there is afaik still 7 days


[2/2/2023 7:36 PM] szybet
okay sure, i was only curious


[2/4/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
@TeaBot are you still waiting for the image


[2/4/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
you have like 20 hours to tell me if so, if yes, i will upload it somewhere


[2/4/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
bonus points if you find some place to store it


[2/4/2023 8:58 PM] tea_bot_
I haven't found one yet, yes I'm still in the market to get one


[2/4/2023 8:58 PM] tea_bot_
Like an upload space for it ? Or storage on my side ?


[2/4/2023 8:59 PM] szybet
those are the same thing, yes


[2/4/2023 9:00 PM] tea_bot_
Oh I meant storage on my side, but like on HDD or something. I can look into it. I think I've got Dropbox but i don't know about the space i can get


[2/4/2023 9:00 PM] szybet
if you want to share it only, we can use syncthing


[2/4/2023 9:01 PM] szybet
but if you want to distribute it in any way, you need to find a public storage space


[2/4/2023 9:03 PM] tea_bot_
I was just gonna share it with people here and there. There's someone on mobile read forum that has a bunch of images and shares them. I was gonna share with them


[2/4/2023 9:04 PM] szybet
okay


[2/4/2023 9:04 PM] szybet
so prepare syncthing or just find another solution like dropbox / mega


[2/4/2023 9:27 PM] tea_bot_
I've got my Dropbox open


[2/4/2023 9:27 PM] tea_bot_
Want me to send you a shared folder and you upload in there?


[2/4/2023 9:28 PM] tea_bot_
Ah I've only got two Gigas of space though


[2/4/2023 9:28 PM] szybet
first i need to find my spare sd card to prepare the image


[2/4/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
i want to clear it & add inkbox add


[2/4/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
its 2.2


[2/4/2023 9:30 PM] szybet
well maybe if andi says that booting off USB is easy for even nickel then i can go for it


[2/4/2023 9:30 PM] tea_bot_
I can try an upgrade for 30 days


[2/4/2023 9:30 PM] szybet
you better find a permanent solution


[2/4/2023 9:33 PM] tea_bot_
Dang, for 0.2 that's too bad


[2/4/2023 9:35 PM] tea_bot_
Ok mega gives 20 Gigs


[2/4/2023 9:36 PM] szybet
the inkbox add is the deal i share this image, it will just be a book that says who's the author and about inkbox. do you accept it?


[2/4/2023 9:37 PM] tea_bot_
A book in the image with like, info on inkbox and everything? That sounds only fair


[2/4/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
yea


[2/4/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
and further info about the image


[2/4/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
technical things


[2/4/2023 9:39 PM] tea_bot_
Yeah, sounds very fair to me, absolutely


[2/4/2023 9:45 PM] tea_bot_
You should have access to this normally


[2/4/2023 9:45 PM] szybet
then don't share this link publicly


[2/4/2023 9:45 PM] szybet
write access to it at least


[2/4/2023 9:46 PM] szybet
i will upload it next week, i lost the sd card which is sad


[2/4/2023 9:47 PM] tea_bot_
Good point, I'm a dummy


[2/4/2023 9:48 PM] tea_bot_
No problem, I'm not in a hurry. Thank you for helping with this 😃

[2/6/2023 9:14 PM] tux_linux
For time / clock?


[2/6/2023 9:14 PM] szybet
obviously almost every IC has a timer circuit in it, which can be a crystal oscilator

but doesnt need to be

Thanks! Will check booting from external SD works in the meantime. My timezone: GMT+8


[2/17/2023 3:48 AM] emulti_
Well it doesn't work. All that happens is a factory reset to a 2012 firmware version from the recovery partition. Interestingly the wifi network is non-functional on that firmware too. I need to find a way to interrupt the boot process and point u-boot at a different kernel/rootfs. I guess I need a serial cable which will take a few days to arrive.


[2/17/2023 10:58 AM] szybet
yes you need a serial cable for sure

Starting from this week I will try to be more productive, I will start by checking once again the status of my SD card installation and where I need to go from there, once I get there I'd like to actively contribute to the project to complete the N249 porting


[2/28/2023 7:55 PM] atro_atro
If everything goes well I would like to make a contribution that is substantial enough to speak about this project at the Chaos Communication Camp conference in a 30 min or 1h talk. @Szybet do you think that this is feasible in ~5 months?


[2/28/2023 7:56 PM] szybet
in a week 8h a day lol


[2/28/2023 7:56 PM] szybet
even porting the clara is enough


[2/28/2023 7:57 PM] szybet
if you really want to contribute, please speak to @tux-linux to give someone else ( me?... ) permissions to all repos. He doesn't have time lately, and my pull request wait and wait

not propably, for sure

[2/28/2023 8:04 PM] tux_linux
But Clara HD isn't even ported yet


[2/28/2023 8:05 PM] tux_linux
Forget it


[2/28/2023 8:05 PM] szybet
the problem is, if we 2 start to work, those pull request will stack up and no one will want to merge them


[2/28/2023 8:05 PM] tux_linux
You don't have any other compatible device?


[2/28/2023 8:06 PM] atro_atro
I don't, however if you want we can have a call and we may try make this porting way faster


[2/28/2023 8:06 PM] tux_linux
I merged one yesterday


[2/28/2023 8:06 PM] tux_linux
I think


[2/28/2023 8:06 PM] szybet
okay then, is this a reason to close the entire restaurant for x months because the main cheff left?


[2/28/2023 8:06 PM] atro_atro
I'm not very experienced at electronics or embedded


[2/28/2023 8:07 PM] szybet
i want you to see when you merge 10 commits that are at the same time in inkbox repo


[2/28/2023 8:07 PM] tux_linux
Tell me you know how to connect a serial port


[2/28/2023 8:07 PM] szybet
no one needs this madness


[2/28/2023 8:07 PM] tux_linux
You said sound isn't ready


[2/28/2023 8:08 PM] szybet
it isin't priority, you are offline mainly so i shifted my focus to keyboard. i need it for school


[2/28/2023 8:08 PM] atro_atro

[2/28/2023 8:08 PM] tux_linux
So what is there to merge apart from gui-bundle that I don't want to merge


[2/28/2023 8:08 PM] tux_linux
Good


[2/28/2023 8:08 PM] szybet
god, i mean imagine the future


[2/28/2023 8:09 PM] tux_linux

it isin't bad. in code quality he means only 
```
if {

else if
```
and camelCase sometimes


[2/28/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
What is there to merge currently


[2/28/2023 8:10 PM] szybet
sometimes english too


[2/28/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
And English


[2/28/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
And design


[2/28/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
And a lot more things


[2/28/2023 8:11 PM] szybet
is this really a reason to not give me permissions that i can approve attro work? i will do mine with pull request anyways, just to speed things up

This week I will do update system redesign
I don't know if it is worth looking into x11


[2/28/2023 8:13 PM] szybet
it


[2/28/2023 8:13 PM] szybet
it is


[2/28/2023 8:13 PM] tux_linux
I consider folders completed


[2/28/2023 8:14 PM] szybet
yes


[2/28/2023 8:14 PM] szybet
im waiting


[2/28/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux
Well, general things, like where to put files, tmpfs-minded design, signature verification, things you forget or don't want to implement


[2/28/2023 8:19 PM] szybet
1. who decided where ipd configs are, new ereader configs... bruh
2. ???
3. where i said "nah dont verify it"


[2/28/2023 8:19 PM] szybet
;_;


[2/28/2023 8:19 PM] tux_linux
User apps? Maybe?


[2/28/2023 8:20 PM] szybet
I dont think so


[2/28/2023 8:21 PM] tux_linux
2 is for updateConfig or smth


[2/28/2023 8:21 PM] tux_linux
Like, writing to the MMC each time is ... wrong


[2/28/2023 8:21 PM] szybet
i explained it alreadyyyy


[2/28/2023 8:22 PM] tux_linux
what's preventing you from putting this in a tmpfs?


[2/28/2023 8:22 PM] tux_linux
well, maybe we did it already


[2/28/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
1. it's to avoid creating another thread
2. this file is created ONLY if config is changed anyway


[2/28/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
yea.........


[2/28/2023 8:23 PM] tux_linux
ok, i was just saying I usually need to remind you about the necessity of using a tmpfs


[2/28/2023 8:24 PM] szybet
this isint a reason to restrict access


[2/28/2023 8:24 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/28/2023 8:25 PM] tux_linux
it's because if you push a huge amount of commits over the span of, say, two months, it might take even more time for me to actually review it and understand what you did
the PRs are better for this because it's for relatively small changes compared to the big project and it forces me to try to understand what you wrote before accepting it so I can at least have an idea of how it works


[2/28/2023 8:27 PM] tux_linux
I also do not feel comfortable at the idea of having code that I didn't review or check in my project


[2/28/2023 8:29 PM] tux_linux
this is why I'm not sure I want to give you, or anyone else, write access


[2/28/2023 8:29 PM] szybet
here and here you have file changes to review? but with me with access, it will be in the repo and other contributions can easily be added, a dev version of inkbox easily created. If not, everything is a mess inside pull request waiting. 

+ there is a reviewed commit button i think


[2/28/2023 8:29 PM] szybet
im here for a year.


[2/28/2023 8:29 PM] szybet
you know it will happen one day anyway?...


[2/28/2023 8:31 PM] szybet
if you want the project to grow and have sense, you need to give write access to someone else because you have a life and are not always active


[2/28/2023 8:34 PM] tux_linux
then what is the difference between a dev branch and a waiting pull request?


[2/28/2023 8:35 PM] szybet
there is order, if me and atro both will wait for approval, it will be bad


[2/28/2023 8:36 PM] szybet
i can review his commit and then push me. no problems, no merge things


[2/28/2023 8:36 PM] szybet
and no wait time


[2/28/2023 8:38 PM] szybet
i dont know if i talked about it before, but the reason im contributing to inkbox, learning qt and cpp for it is only because plato creator is not welcoming, so open about his project


[2/28/2023 8:38 PM] szybet

Hi all, I have a Kobo Touch N905C and came across this OS yesterday. I downloaded v1.5 and copied it across to an SD card using Balena Etcher. My Kobo just boots into the normal OS? Please can someone advise?

Are you the guy from github?


[3/1/2023 10:41 AM] szybet
Welcome


[3/1/2023 10:42 AM] szybet
Does the n905c have an internal emmc?


[3/1/2023 10:42 AM] szybet
Is the sd card the main storage?


[3/1/2023 10:45 AM] szybet
Write it using the way as described in the download page


[3/1/2023 10:46 AM] szybet
Make sure ypu write to the correct storage


[3/1/2023 10:50 AM] charlton22
I haven't posted anything on Github no, and thank you


[3/1/2023 10:51 AM] charlton22
It has a 256mb boot drive and a 1.3gb internal chip (States 2gb online)


[3/1/2023 10:51 AM] charlton22
When I try and write the image to the internal chip, it says it doesn't have enough space


[3/1/2023 11:04 AM] szybet
What boot drive?


[3/1/2023 11:04 AM] szybet
Is it really a n905c?...


[3/1/2023 11:04 AM] szybet
Wait for @tux-linux


[3/1/2023 11:20 AM] charlton22
Definitely a N905C yes. Ok, thank you


[3/1/2023 11:24 AM] charlton22
I may have mistaken the boot drive for another device plugged into my machine


[3/1/2023 12:16 PM] szybet
Sounds most likely


[3/1/2023 2:02 PM] tux_linux
You can't use the external SD slot

There is another one inside the device

but its another sd card


[3/1/2023 8:49 PM] tux_linux
we don't support external sd cards


[3/1/2023 9:26 PM] charlton22
It's the internal one, but it's only created a storage partition of 500mb


[3/1/2023 9:26 PM] tux_linux
then do this

[3/4/2023 2:19 PM] tux_linux
we have 2 big things remaining to do before we release v2.0


[3/4/2023 2:19 PM] tux_linux
1. finish update system redesign
2. fix xorg


[3/4/2023 2:19 PM] tux_linux
third one is actually have the GUI to launch again, see #dev

[3/4/2023 2:20 PM] dobamuffin
Hopefully the font size issues and not being able to close out of a menu are fixed.


[3/4/2023 2:20 PM] tux_linux
what exactly are they


[3/4/2023 2:20 PM] szybet
File chooser menu?


[3/4/2023 2:20 PM] tux_linux
what version of OS


[3/4/2023 2:21 PM] dobamuffin
The newest release on GitHub. I have an issue where when I open up a menu or something with the x button on the tip right, it gets cropped off the screen and I can't click it.

Hey thanks! I saw this project while digging for some projects to tinker with. 

Have a kobo libra 2 so not in the supported devices yet but I would be interested in testing and doing what little I can to help. Not much on the software development side (yet) but have spent some time administering Linux networks

I have some pdf comics that have been scanned double page per page is there a good easy way to batch process them to cut them so they fit nicely on the kobo screen?


[3/7/2023 10:06 PM] nonasuomy
I tried Calibre but not sure if it knows how to do that.


[3/7/2023 10:07 PM] szybet
i dont think cutting will be better than just using it native, with zoom adjustments / scrolling


[3/7/2023 10:08 PM] nonasuomy
For some reason when you zoom the text is still garbage or the page doesn't scale properly so its difficult for a young reader.


[3/7/2023 10:09 PM] szybet
you mean inkbox?


[3/7/2023 10:17 PM] nonasuomy
So I wasn't waiting long enough for the zoom pass over but still would like to cut the pages as zooming around the page is rough on eink


[3/7/2023 10:18 PM] szybet
it does the job - it should refresh after the moving though


[3/7/2023 10:19 PM] nonasuomy
Guess I have to find some automated pdf cutter


[3/7/2023 10:20 PM] nonasuomy
that just cuts ever page down the center and puts it into two separated pages


[3/7/2023 10:22 PM] nonasuomy
Most software seems to split the pages into multiple pdfs but not actually  take one of the pages and split it into two.

So after looking through all the pages it randomly would cut pages half way through. Using mutool first did well splitting everything right down the middle `mutool poster -x 2 in.pdf out.pdf` though it cuts the cover as well 😄

in Germany

so you have to use more expensive things

DHL small parcels starts at 6 euros to Poland, with insurance and tracking it is 14 euros, so if there is some distrust, then probably sellers will try to use something with tracking

[3/15/2023 10:38 PM] ninuje
There are usually (very strong) rules about shipping stuff that's a fire hazard via air, yeah


[3/15/2023 10:39 PM] ninuje
Even via road, getting alcohol shipped to a pharmacy usually requires a separate delivery


[3/15/2023 10:39 PM] tux_linux
Well here in Canada I don't seem to have got problems about road shipping eReaders


[3/15/2023 10:40 PM] ninuje
(that's half because fire hazard, and half because weird legacy custom rules about alcohol because moonshine days ;p)

On the upside, I have access to medical grade isopropyl alcohol, which is kind of a bitch to get otherwise in france

Any diffrences from regular one?


[3/15/2023 10:47 PM] ninuje
fun fact (probably because of even more weird EU/FR  rules): it has an expiry date (of ~5 years)


[3/15/2023 10:47 PM] ninuje
it's basically pure (99.99%, or ~200 proof for our US friends)

As you are here, could you look up #dev with my usb libs compiling problem?

missed what you were trying to build


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] ninuje
saw the log but don't know what it's from


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
libusb needs libudev, libudev needs usb utils, usb utils needs libusb


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
Basically that


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
Whole problem in one sentence


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] ninuje
I'm pretty sure I've built libudev in the past w/o libusb


[3/15/2023 10:50 PM] ninuje
might be a configure (or meson?) flag to disable


[3/15/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
Well i hadnt found one yet

And im not the only one with the problem, someone trying to compile it for android had similar issues and solved it with rust hackery i dont understand yet


[3/15/2023 10:52 PM] ninuje
Which doesn't appear to depend on libusb at all, so, there you have it? 😄

I looked into it and yyyyyyyy i have some concerns it will work


[3/15/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje
It was forked by Gentoo devs originally, yeah


[3/15/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje
And as such is still used on Gentoo if using OpenRC instead of systemd


[3/15/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje
But it's not really Gentoo-specific


[3/15/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje
I used it to test libinput, FWIW


[3/15/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje

[3/15/2023 11:25 PM] andi15701
that looks very different


[3/15/2023 11:25 PM] szybet
its this


[3/15/2023 11:26 PM] szybet
`--disable-programs -disable-selinux --disable-manpages` worked


[3/15/2023 11:26 PM] andi15701
you can compile libusb without libudev dep


[3/15/2023 11:26 PM] andi15701
that way around


[3/15/2023 11:27 PM] andi15701
so I disabled udev dep in compiling libusb by specifying --disable-udev in libusb configure


[3/15/2023 11:27 PM] szybet
there isin't something like that but it worked, but --disable-FEATURE is propably that


[3/15/2023 11:28 PM] szybet
well anyway i want libudev to work in qt


[3/15/2023 11:28 PM] szybet
so i think disabling it is not a way


[3/15/2023 11:36 PM] ninuje
That's just old kernel headers


[3/15/2023 11:37 PM] ninuje
I may have just fed it a bunch of -D defines via CPPFLAGS, but up-to-date kernel headers would also do the trick


[3/15/2023 11:37 PM] ninuje
Event if they're not the TC's, but just in another location appended to search paths


[3/15/2023 11:44 PM] ninuje
e.g., it's similar in spirit to this mess I use when doing input stuff: https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk/blob/6572b5f393f810785e382104391d177120da46f6/fbink_button_scan.h#L35-L66

[3/15/2023 11:44 PM] ninuje
Because the 2.6.whatever kernel headers I use for the kobo TC are too old to declare these evdev events and/or keys


[3/15/2023 11:44 PM] ninuje
And that stuff is just numbers, so it's entirely safe to fake

What issues are you experiencing, specifically?


[3/22/2023 12:17 AM] joyh
Well, I'm sure it's things that are my fault haha. I installed it, booted it up, looking great, but I can't go into the SD card at all on my pc. It's unreadable/unviewable, and I can't resize the partitions (I had installed it on a 32gb SD card.) That said, I haven't updated everything yet, and it's an old version, so I still have things I can try before I bother anyone too much!

[3/22/2023 10:24 AM] joyh
Ooh, it's not possible on windows?


[3/22/2023 10:28 AM] szybet
Not my fault windows partition manager is crap


[3/22/2023 10:31 AM] joyh
I was able to partition the same SD cards with miniToolPartition Wizard before flashing, so it seems odd to be locked out of that option now, but I'll try it, thank you


[3/22/2023 10:34 AM] joyh
Can inkbox read ebooks with drm protection?

[3/22/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
what


[3/22/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
😆


[3/22/2023 6:01 PM] szybet
inkbox has sanki - my anki compatible flash card app


[3/22/2023 6:01 PM] szybet
its outdated, i will update it ~~soon~~


[3/22/2023 6:07 PM] szybet
remarkable doesnt have any


[3/22/2023 10:50 PM] carol12321.
I downloaded balenaetcher for windows and and flashed inkbox-1.5-n905c onto my kobo forma… When it was completed, my device reset and was wiped clean, going through all the intro kobo setup again. How can I fix this? How do I properly set up inkbox on the kobo forma?


[3/22/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
is kobo forma the n905c? no? its the kobo touch? are you insane? writing and incompatible device image... anyway **kobo forma is not supported, no one ported it + you need to flash it with the sd card in it, not by connecting the ereader to your pc. ( DONT DO IT ITS NOT SUPPORTED )**


[3/22/2023 10:54 PM] szybet
you could eassly destroy it by writing a RANDOM IMAGE to it. STOP


[3/22/2023 10:58 PM] carol12321.
Not everyone is as knowledgeable as you on this… I thought n905c was the name of a software update. I asked about kobo forma and you replied with inkbox, so I tried to download it.


[3/22/2023 10:59 PM] szybet
> Not everyone is as knowledgeable as you on this
I understand. Thats why you always ask before doing something you dont understand?


[3/22/2023 10:59 PM] carol12321.
I did lol


[3/22/2023 10:59 PM] szybet
i did not respond with "Write this image"...


[3/22/2023 11:00 PM] carol12321.
It’s fine, it’s still working so no problem


[3/22/2023 11:00 PM] szybet
yea... like cats have 9 lives, apparently your ereader has 2 at least


[3/22/2023 11:00 PM] carol12321.
I wasn’t too attached with what was on it


[3/22/2023 11:01 PM] szybet
i mean completly destroying the device - it wouldn't do anything

[3/22/2023 11:02 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/22/2023 11:02 PM] carol12321.
So only devices with removable sd cards work?


[3/22/2023 11:02 PM] szybet
no, its more complicated


[3/22/2023 11:03 PM] szybet
only devices that a person found time to port inkbox to it work


[3/22/2023 11:03 PM] carol12321.
But only certain kobo models


[3/22/2023 11:04 PM] szybet
only because noone ported it


[3/22/2023 11:04 PM] carol12321.
I don’t even know what porting is


[3/22/2023 11:04 PM] szybet
making sure it works on a new device


[3/22/2023 11:05 PM] carol12321.
Is it impossible for it to work on kobo forma?


[3/22/2023 11:05 PM] szybet
it is possible, as i said


[3/22/2023 11:05 PM] carol12321.
But a lot of work for someone


[3/22/2023 11:06 PM] szybet
most of the time "someone" enjoys it

Yes


[3/23/2023 2:51 PM] tux_linux
Someone did run android on Kobo Glo


[3/23/2023 2:51 PM] tux_linux
But mainly useless now because it was android 2.x

like another eBook reader program made to be used on linux


[3/24/2023 6:22 PM] dominiac
is it possible to install without much fuss?


[3/24/2023 6:23 PM] dominiac
I'm really impressed by the project and I'm inclined to get one kobo to tinker with this👀


[3/24/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
define much fuss


[3/24/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
cross compiling almost always is much fuss


[3/24/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
+ xorg + app is always heavier than a native app, so not a good idea in a long run


[3/24/2023 6:26 PM] szybet
1 core cpu and not too much ram, its less than a RPI 0


[3/24/2023 6:27 PM] szybet
+ xorg does a bit of refreshes that are unneceserry, so that doesnt look as great too


[3/24/2023 6:29 PM] dominiac
I see


[3/24/2023 6:30 PM] dominiac
so the lighter the program the better


[3/24/2023 6:32 PM] dominiac
btw did you guys make that scribbler program?


[3/24/2023 6:32 PM] dominiac
where u make drawings and stuff on the screen


[3/24/2023 6:41 PM] szybet
which one


[3/24/2023 6:42 PM] szybet
the problem is xorg uses ram / resources, a program that write to the screen by itself ( QT ones ) are native, better


[3/24/2023 6:46 PM] dominiac
so if I got a program thats runs with QT does it work better? of even if I made a program with QT gui?

InkBox OS is a complete operating system replacement for Kobo eReader devices. It currently runs on the Glo, Touch and Mini models. It is built around Qt 5.15.2 and namely features ePUB rendering. Along that, full KoBox/X11 support is integrated, allowing the user to run X apps natively on the device.

[3/25/2023 3:08 AM] .ccache
Buying 2nd hand devices is always kind of a gamble. If you’re in a place where these things are really common, might be able to just pick one up locally.


[3/25/2023 3:08 AM] .ccache
This way you would be able to inspect the device before actually paying for it


[3/25/2023 12:24 PM] dominiac
I was thinking in getting one from cex


[3/25/2023 12:25 PM] dominiac
its 2nd hand but hey inspect it and stuff to see if its in good condition

I have been discovered


[3/26/2023 1:49 PM] szybet
You are the guy who asked about plato


[3/26/2023 1:49 PM] szybet
well welcome


[3/26/2023 1:49 PM] kuratius
just opened my nia and took out the 16GB sd card, now trying to figure out what I need to do to get a OS I can actually run my own software with


[3/26/2023 1:50 PM] kuratius
yeah


[3/26/2023 1:50 PM] kuratius
(bit confused that they hide 8GB of capacity but eh)


[3/26/2023 1:50 PM] szybet
1. clone the sd card, make a backup
2. https://inkbox.ddns.net/downloads.html flash the nia image


[3/26/2023 1:51 PM] szybet
its for system, but with inkbox you get arround 3Gb~ more out of it


[3/26/2023 1:52 PM] kuratius
I think mine had 6.7 GB  free out of 8 GB when I got it, so I assume that's not the the whole story


[3/26/2023 1:52 PM] kuratius
would make more sense if those 1.3 GB were the OS and the rest is product stack segmentation


[3/26/2023 1:53 PM] kuratius
8GB sd cards are probably similar in price to 16GB ones


[3/26/2023 1:53 PM] tux_linux
P1 is boot flags
P2 is recovery system
P3 is root filesystem
P4 is UI components, X11 and user data


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] kuratius
this doesnt work for custom software right?


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] tux_linux
You need to root it


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] szybet
you mean?


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] szybet
yea, rooting it is needed


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] tux_linux
And update to 2.0-dev


[3/26/2023 1:54 PM] kuratius
wiki says I need to recompile the kernel first


[3/26/2023 1:55 PM] tux_linux
Yes, good way to familiarize you with build process


[3/26/2023 1:55 PM] kuratius
I cant do that on the kobo directly right?


[3/26/2023 1:55 PM] tux_linux
You can compile everything for 2.0 and you will have learned most of what you need to do for your user app


[3/26/2023 1:56 PM] tux_linux
It would take 10^100 years and probably not be finished even then


[3/26/2023 1:56 PM] tux_linux
You have access to a Linux PC?


[3/26/2023 1:56 PM] kuratius
ya


[3/26/2023 1:56 PM] kuratius
but I have to reboot first


[3/26/2023 1:58 PM] tux_linux
How much time would you have for this ?
>90% of people registering here say hello, maybe ask some questions, sometimes want to do something for the project but then they disappear and never come back


[3/26/2023 1:58 PM] kuratius
is the clone needed if I use a different sd card for inkbox?


[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] tux_linux
Well, It's always good

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] tux_linux
But no


[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] tux_linux
Not mandatory


[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] szybet
at least backup the first 100Mb then


[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] szybet
of the sd card


[3/26/2023 1:59 PM] szybet
its the most important


[3/26/2023 2:00 PM] tux_linux
Yes
Contains eink and kernel magic


[3/26/2023 2:00 PM] kuratius
I'm primarily interested in compiling plato for inkbox


[3/26/2023 2:00 PM] kuratius
Not really planning anything fancy beyond that


[3/26/2023 2:00 PM] tux_linux
You don't like the default reader without even having tried it?


[3/26/2023 2:01 PM] szybet
you dont even need to compile - just pack it - make a launch script and maybe improve gui apps permission giving


[3/26/2023 2:01 PM] kuratius
I don't have an opinion on plato either, I just want to try it and see what the interface and performance is like


[3/26/2023 2:01 PM] tux_linux
Ok

[3/26/2023 2:02 PM] tux_linux
"minor"


[3/26/2023 2:06 PM] szybet
plato apart from pdf is better than the inkbox reader *for now*


[3/26/2023 2:06 PM] szybet
~~in my opinion~~


[3/26/2023 2:07 PM] kuratius
Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but do the inkbox reader and plato work with vertical text?


[3/26/2023 2:07 PM] kuratius
Iirc koreader still crashes when opening a book with it


[3/26/2023 2:07 PM] tux_linux
?


[3/26/2023 2:07 PM] kuratius
Japanese text is vertical


[3/26/2023 2:07 PM] tux_linux
No idea


[3/26/2023 2:08 PM] szybet
no chance, propably


[3/26/2023 2:08 PM] kuratius
Works on the default kobo software at least


[3/26/2023 2:08 PM] szybet
But you can add support for it for sure


[3/26/2023 2:11 PM] kuratius
Is fedora fine or should I use a debian based distro? My desktop has Nobara Linux, my laptop has xubuntu, but it's very slow


[3/26/2023 2:11 PM] szybet
whatever really


[3/26/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
the only problem that we had was arch - so if something goes wrong use a debian container


[3/26/2023 2:12 PM] kuratius
(Would be better if it outright crashed or gave an error instead of trying to open the book for 10 minutes before failing)


[3/26/2023 2:12 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/26/2023 2:13 PM] szybet
my problems with koreader was that it had a memory leak - after some time reading it got slower and slower


[3/26/2023 3:19 PM] tux_linux
Debian is probably a better idea


[3/26/2023 3:19 PM] tux_linux
Were you on a development build?


[3/26/2023 3:36 PM] szybet
Nope


[3/26/2023 3:37 PM] szybet
Dont complain - there is a reason i develio my own now ;p


[3/26/2023 4:13 PM] kuratius
can you list the repos and build steps for making an image?


[3/26/2023 4:13 PM] kuratius
I haven't found anything like that on the wiki

Look up my feather notes repo - there is a script and base for generating an image


[3/26/2023 4:17 PM] szybet
You mean an app or os image?


[3/26/2023 4:17 PM] kuratius
I did mean an os image, but this will probably be useful too


[3/26/2023 4:17 PM] szybet
Well for user app you already know


[3/26/2023 4:18 PM] szybet
Why do you want an os image?


[3/26/2023 4:18 PM] kuratius
I'm under the impression that I need to recompile the kernel to install a custom userapp without approval by an inkbox developer

(this should probably be linked on the wiki)+


[3/26/2023 4:21 PM] szybet
Yep, and you dont need to update the whole os to update the kernel


[3/26/2023 4:22 PM] szybet
Look up my repo niAudio and inkbox.md file, there is the dd command to update the kernel


[3/26/2023 4:23 PM] kuratius
I still think it's probably a good idea to make a build script that can make an image from scratch


[3/26/2023 4:23 PM] kuratius
does that exist somewhere?


[3/26/2023 4:24 PM] szybet
Yes


[3/26/2023 4:24 PM] szybet
It does


[3/26/2023 4:24 PM] szybet
Kobo-inkbox organisation, some repo there


[3/26/2023 4:24 PM] szybet
still you dont need an image

tux-linux creates images


[3/26/2023 5:04 PM] kuratius
I'd like to try this, if it's really hard I'll probably give up but if there's a build script then it should be doable


[3/26/2023 5:04 PM] kuratius
sorry if it's annoying


[3/26/2023 5:04 PM] szybet
trying to build only the kernel is easier than the whole os...


[3/26/2023 5:05 PM] szybet
the kernel is one script only anyway


[3/26/2023 5:05 PM] kuratius
(also in case it matters, most browsers block the image download from the ddns website because it doesnt use https, probably a good idea to add an image to the github release)


[3/26/2023 5:05 PM] szybet
use wget then


[3/26/2023 5:06 PM] kuratius
it's trivial to circumvent, I just dont want to

Good luck with imgtool then

Try to look inside the script


[3/26/2023 5:12 PM] tux_linux
1.It's too big
2.The ddns server is https
The download server (23.163.0.39) isn't, simply because it's a download server


[3/26/2023 5:13 PM] kuratius
Download servers cant or shouldnt use https?

[3/26/2023 8:28 PM] .ccache
especially on a low-spec server or a vm the several hundred megs of memory that snapd uses actually matters


[3/26/2023 8:29 PM] .ccache
firefox was also forced to switch to snap-only before they were even able to iron out the performance issues

It's not needed anymore

Are there any known issues with these instructions? I have not progressed very far with them, so it would seem that something is up. https://github.com/aartoni/n249/blob/main/installation.md

Also tried plato on default kobo os (after making a backup) and apparently it cant render Japanese epubs correctly (it converts them to horizontal text and doesnt know how to deal with the furigina/reading aids so it just puts them on the same line)

[3/27/2023 2:17 PM] kuratius
Will the issues with imgtool be fixed? It seems like those may be classified as a bug & having an easy way to get started with the newest version would be convenient. It's not possible to connect to a wifi network with a hyphen in the passphrase.

One of the things you may want to add is a dependency & directory check at the very beginning so that the process isn't interrupted midway. It doesn't seem to exit correctly if a step fails and you end up having to reboot your system (may be a qemu issue?)

If not then instructions for how to actually build a dev version should probably be added to the github or the wiki, though that's probably more complicated. 
I don't think blackholing information in the discord is a good idea, though I understand that you may want people to come in and talk to you because that may result in them contributing to the project, but if building the project is complicated enough then that's more detrimental than helpful.


[3/27/2023 2:20 PM] tux_linux
Yes
The problem is that we lack time
imgtool was designed for my computer with a specific set of packages installed even if I tried to make universal. It probably is the first time someone else tried it out. You can submit PRs to improve it.
Keyboard issues have been fixed in 2.0


[3/27/2023 2:21 PM] szybet
It maybe is not mutool issue, we need to debug it deeper


[3/27/2023 2:21 PM] szybet

It's a script


[3/27/2023 2:24 PM] tux_linux
What do you want to use it for


[3/27/2023 2:24 PM] kuratius
Extracting dependencies automatically


[3/27/2023 2:24 PM] szybet
Its more complicated than that


[3/27/2023 2:25 PM] kuratius
If not I have to go through line-by-line and google every command


[3/27/2023 2:25 PM] szybet
There is maybe propably a tool like that?


[3/27/2023 2:25 PM] tux_linux
It must be experience, but how can you think ldd is smart enough to get through the whole file and scan for commands?
We are not at this level of magic unfortunately 🙂


[3/27/2023 2:26 PM] kuratius
It works for binaries, but I guess those have their libraries listed in a more convenient fashion

{Reactions}
👍 

[3/27/2023 2:27 PM] tux_linux
You will probably need
qemu-nbd
bash
sudo
uboot tools
xz
busybox
build-essential (maybe)
etc

you have a list of binaries and you just want to find out what package(s) you should install to get them, correct?


[3/27/2023 2:34 PM] kuratius
Well, basically the idea would have been that I'd get a list libraries and then I'd somehow figure out the package names I guess


[3/27/2023 2:34 PM] kuratius
But probably not needed if it's short enough

I tested imgtool on Debian
Maybe it's why you're getting the Nbd socket issue
You should try Debian


[3/27/2023 2:39 PM] kuratius
It's probably difficult for bash because a bash script technically only contains symbolic links/aliases so those may not be Automatically linked to a specific package (though I remember being suggested packages when trying some commands that weren't installed before, so there seems to be some way to do it fuzzily)

It does the same thing but it has to redo it every time a display setting is changed so it's basically unusable because changing font size or spacing etc always results in the device freezing for a few minutes


[3/28/2023 10:36 AM] kuratius
also here's a build log from the image builder (most recent attempt) it gets pretty far, but apparently the image is missing a partition table 
```bash -x ./release.bash n306 testing root &>full.txt 
```

You did not provide a valid private key and/or it needs an absolute path

At the step "Creating the boot script image" in this guide, where is that boot script supposed to be located? https://github.com/aartoni/n249/blob/main/installation.md#creating-the-boot-script-image

[3/28/2023 2:34 PM] well_met_outlander
I also assumed the previous step "Signing overlaymount-rootfs" takes place in /home/build/inkbox and not /home/build/inkbox/kernel but I might be wrong about that.


[3/28/2023 2:49 PM] kuratius
suggestion: change     ```printf "You must provide the 'private key' argument.\n" ``` to 'You must provide the 'private key dir' argument'


[3/28/2023 3:00 PM] tux_linux
Dir? It just needs a file


[3/28/2023 3:25 PM] kuratius
private key file/path then


[3/28/2023 3:26 PM] kuratius
probably also specify that it's a specifically a 2048 bit rsa key


[3/28/2023 3:31 PM] szybet
Any pull requests are welcome


[3/28/2023 3:31 PM] szybet
It takes place on the sd card?... Ifk we will see, not important for now

Get the source: https://github.com/kobolabs/Kobo-Reader/blob/master/hw/imx6ull-nia/kernel.tar.bz2

Grab the config from arch/arm/configs/imx_v7_kobo_defconfig and copy it to the main directory as .config

Create a symlink to your cloned repo from /home/build/inkbox/kernel/. The script getting busybox is static.

* I have writed this sentence, and now I don't know whot a talked about. Could you clarify?

Enable Loopback device support, FUSE and SquashFS with XZ support.

* whot are the specific "names" of the changes? so it would be easy to paste the name in menuconfig, using "/" and then enable this feature````what is going on here?


[3/28/2023 4:57 PM] szybet

That's a different beast altogether ;). That usually means some pretty intricate and complex CSS, or a gigantic book (i.e., omnibus). I'll look at it and forward it to our CRe wizard, thanks 😉


[3/28/2023 5:09 PM] ninuje
(Probably has nothing to do with vertical layout, though)


[3/28/2023 5:11 PM] ninuje
The latest release does these re-renders in the bg to alleviate the issue, FWIW (which, on a sane book usually only takes a few seconds, or even much less on newer SoCs)

suggestion: provide an official torrent for inkbox images


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] szybet
we have 2 mirrors


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] szybet
why torrent


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] szybet
when we have only 2 mirrors


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] kuratius
you do?


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] szybet
of inkbox


[3/28/2023 5:43 PM] szybet
the official download page


[3/28/2023 5:44 PM] kuratius
I only see one mirror


[3/28/2023 5:44 PM] szybet
and the second server of apps


[3/28/2023 5:44 PM] szybet
there will be images for 2.0


[3/28/2023 5:44 PM] kuratius
and right now it seems quite slow


[3/28/2023 5:44 PM] szybet
the second one is fast


[3/28/2023 5:45 PM] kuratius
also  if you provide a hash there isnt really an argument against also providing a torrent


[3/28/2023 5:45 PM] szybet
welp


[3/28/2023 5:45 PM] szybet
sure then


[3/28/2023 5:45 PM] szybet
i dont see a reason for torrent - tux-linux propably too but if you remind us about it before we release 2.0 then sure we can add it


[3/28/2023 5:46 PM] ninuje
Plus, you'd need seeders for a torrent to be of any use


[3/28/2023 5:46 PM] szybet
~~if we have the resources to do so~~


[3/28/2023 5:46 PM] szybet
thats why i dont see any sense in it ;p


[3/28/2023 5:47 PM] kuratius
maybe my internet is just fucked atm


[3/28/2023 5:57 PM] kuratius
If there's ever an activity spike of people trying to download images you'll be glad for it


[3/28/2023 5:58 PM] kuratius
It's not difficult either


[3/28/2023 7:55 PM] kuratius
imo seeding is a better use of someone's home internet for hosting downloads anyway


[3/28/2023 8:11 PM] kuratius
Is the kernel supposed to be 10MB?


[3/28/2023 8:11 PM] kuratius
writing it with dd to /dev/sdb and the offset you gave results in a crash

Please download a static strace binary https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/usr/bin/strace?raw=true
then login in initrd and transfer it with busybox rx and minicom
Make sure your terminal application has buffer lines set to >10000000
Then run
`./strace /etc/init.d/init`


[3/29/2023 1:40 PM] tux_linux
Copy output and send it


[3/29/2023 1:44 PM] kuratius
Please break the instructions down a bit more

Is initrd a boot phase?
How do I log in there?
What command is used to transfer if?

It may be a bit tricky for me to run the command without breaking the uart connection, is that likely to be an issue?


[3/29/2023 1:45 PM] kuratius
It isn't possible to just set it to write the stacktrace to the sd card is it?

[3/29/2023 1:52 PM] tux_linux
I usually do that
Or take ethernet wires and roll them around your gpio wires
They are more solid and tend to move less and stuck in place


[3/29/2023 1:52 PM] tux_linux
They are too vague
You can't tell much from them
That's why I need strace


[3/29/2023 1:54 PM] kuratius
If you want to reproduce what I did I can tell you
It's just download image->flash to sd
Compile n306 kernel with root option
Then use the dd command szybet told me to use with of=/dev/sdb (sd card) to write the kernel to the sd


[3/29/2023 1:57 PM] tux_linux
Oh you downloaded the image


[3/29/2023 1:57 PM] tux_linux
I thought you used imgtool


[3/29/2023 1:57 PM] tux_linux
imgtool signs everything for you


[3/29/2023 1:57 PM] tux_linux

It's in various initrd scripts and in inkbox-os-init

upload a vm image that people can use for building (maybe?)


[3/29/2023 2:20 PM] kuratius
also it's not hard to just write down the directory structure required/expected


[3/29/2023 2:20 PM] szybet
Not vm, container


[3/29/2023 2:21 PM] kuratius
that works too

(takes ~1 min to make with transmission-gtk)


[3/29/2023 6:02 PM] kuratius
@tux-linux next time you're on your pc, can you post the absolute paths of all the repos on your system in a config where your build script succeeds?


[3/29/2023 6:03 PM] kuratius
(didn't add trackers, so may need to redo it later)


[3/29/2023 6:04 PM] kuratius
If someone wants to try the link and see if it works as is let me know


[3/29/2023 6:15 PM] szybet
Give him `find /` thats it


[3/29/2023 6:26 PM] kuratius
Still says security policy was violated


[3/29/2023 6:44 PM] szybet
Yea, delete the boot flag now


[3/29/2023 7:14 PM] kuratius
still complains about violated security policy


[3/29/2023 7:14 PM] kuratius
it wouldnt have made sense for it to work anyway


[3/29/2023 7:14 PM] kuratius
else the private key would be written in the kernel repo, defeating the point of signing in the first place


[3/29/2023 7:15 PM] kuratius
I get that such a strict security policy is useful for kobos without sd cards since it makes people less likely to brick their devices, but if inkbox is only running on sd-card enabled devices anyways I dont see the point


[3/29/2023 7:16 PM] kuratius
(also different question, can you write to the sd card from the serial port? would be interesting if that meant installing inkbox on non-sdcard enables kobos was possible, if very slow


[3/29/2023 7:17 PM] kuratius
14 kB/s apparently


[3/29/2023 7:18 PM] kuratius
only takes a little bit less than a day to write 1 GB


[3/29/2023 7:18 PM] kuratius
so maybe possible but not really desirable


[3/29/2023 7:18 PM] kuratius
still probably worth doing a backup that way


[3/29/2023 7:21 PM] kuratius
may be an idea: load image as file via usb, then load small program via serial that does the rest?


[3/29/2023 7:21 PM] kuratius
btw is there serial output without an sd card?


[3/29/2023 7:23 PM] kuratius
Ima look at the fcc filings for a sage


[3/29/2023 7:29 PM] kuratius

Libra 2 I still disassembled the KOBO Libra2 Kobo Reader


[3/29/2023 7:30 PM] kuratius
found something for the libra 2


[3/29/2023 7:31 PM] kuratius
oof


[3/29/2023 7:32 PM] kuratius
so basically you want to either dissolve the glue chemically or thermally, or you want to figure out how to read or write to the contacts of the sd card without removing it


[3/29/2023 7:33 PM] kuratius
(I dont have any of these, I'm just curious)


[3/29/2023 7:33 PM] szybet
There isint any private key, you dont have it🥴


[3/29/2023 7:34 PM] szybet
Its checkwd with the puvlic key


[3/29/2023 7:34 PM] szybet
You are doing something wrong...


[3/29/2023 7:35 PM] szybet
From usb yes, from serial port ugh not really, complicated


[3/29/2023 7:35 PM] kuratius
I ran the git reset --hard command you suggested and then ran the compile again


[3/29/2023 7:35 PM] kuratius
then I used dd with the offset you gave


[3/29/2023 7:35 PM] szybet
Its not strict, its for protecting the data inside ( why not? )


[3/29/2023 7:36 PM] szybet
And the image is downloaded?


[3/29/2023 7:36 PM] kuratius
yes


[3/29/2023 7:36 PM] szybet
You mean?

apparently there isnt, just checked


[3/29/2023 7:37 PM] kuratius
it doesnt even try to boot


[3/29/2023 7:37 PM] szybet
What are you talking about, what glue


[3/29/2023 7:37 PM] kuratius
some of the waterproof kobos have glue in the sd card slot


[3/29/2023 7:37 PM] kuratius
it's a tangent, dont think about it


[3/29/2023 7:37 PM] szybet
The cpu boots directly from the sd card, the "bios" is on the sd card


[3/29/2023 7:38 PM] szybet
Nah, no glue can stop hackers


[3/29/2023 7:38 PM] szybet
We have an idea for an installer from the main os but quess what: no time


[3/29/2023 7:39 PM] kuratius
this wasnt a complaint


[3/29/2023 7:39 PM] kuratius
dont worry about it


[3/29/2023 7:39 PM] kuratius
I just like to think out loud


[3/29/2023 7:40 PM] kuratius
@Szybet can you give the hash of the kernel?


[3/29/2023 7:40 PM] kuratius
as in the compiled one


[3/29/2023 7:40 PM] szybet
You are doing something wrong, the nia is the most used device for inkbox lately ( I have it ). Please send me your sd card image, compressed. I will test it and figure this out tommorow


[3/29/2023 7:41 PM] kuratius
with or without the kernel replacement?


[3/29/2023 7:41 PM] szybet
Every compilation, every system, every cpu* (maybe not) compiles a bit diffrent. No point in hashes for self compiled software


[3/29/2023 7:41 PM] szybet
With


[3/29/2023 7:42 PM] kuratius
that doesnt apply to cross compilation


[3/29/2023 7:42 PM] kuratius
so it's irrelevant


[3/29/2023 7:42 PM] szybet
Doubt it


[3/29/2023 7:43 PM] kuratius
and if you need repeatable compilation you can set the feature set to the base of whatever architecture you are compiling for


[3/29/2023 7:43 PM] szybet
Using diffrent distros but the same toolchain gives diffrent results ( sometimes it doesnt work, because magic! ) so yea.


[3/29/2023 7:43 PM] kuratius
instead of the native one for your system


[3/29/2023 7:43 PM] kuratius
that isnt how compilers work


[3/29/2023 7:44 PM] szybet
Not really good idea, arm has some cool specific things


[3/29/2023 7:44 PM] szybet
Yea cool, and? Kernel compiled with arch was crashing in boot, but with debian it worked fine.


[3/29/2023 7:44 PM] kuratius
I know but the point is compilation is repeatable, if you set the same architecture and feature set


[3/29/2023 7:45 PM] szybet
Yea but you said base features


[3/29/2023 7:46 PM] kuratius
this is just changing compiler flags, "base features" compilation is something you only do for software that needs to run the same way and have the same binary, on every system you compile it with
but this is cross compilation so your compiler flags dont depend on the system you compile with, only the target


[3/29/2023 7:47 PM] kuratius
compilers are deterministic unless there is a compiler bug


[3/29/2023 7:48 PM] kuratius
(which is something you report to the developer of said compiler)


[3/29/2023 7:48 PM] szybet
Not every arm cpu has the same features, i suspect this toolchain has some features enabled


[3/29/2023 7:48 PM] szybet
*for the target


[3/29/2023 7:48 PM] kuratius
possibly, but if you enable the same features on a different system it ought to produce the same binary bit by bit


[3/29/2023 7:49 PM] kuratius
if it doesnt you're relying on undefined behavior and possibly memory bugs to compile your program


[3/29/2023 7:49 PM] kuratius
which is really really bad


[3/29/2023 7:50 PM] kuratius
it'd mean that cross compilation is not a reliable strategy even when done properly


[3/29/2023 7:51 PM] kuratius
is the offset you gave for a specific partition or for the device as a whole?


[3/29/2023 7:51 PM] szybet
Welp i know, but my experience is diffrent


[3/29/2023 7:51 PM] szybet
Device as a whole...?


[3/29/2023 7:52 PM] kuratius
the sd card


[3/29/2023 7:52 PM] szybet
Compiled on my arch - didnt worked 
Compiled on arxh on a diffrent system - worked

Im talking about inkbox kernel. This situtation i had is why i use a debian container for compiling things

Worked not worked as crashed during boot


[3/29/2023 7:53 PM] szybet
Yes, whole sd card


[3/29/2023 7:53 PM] szybet
I gave you the exact command


[3/29/2023 7:53 PM] kuratius
could be that your compiler uses a library or you were using a different compiler version


[3/29/2023 7:53 PM] szybet
Nope, clean repo the same


[3/29/2023 7:54 PM] kuratius
a compiler is just a binary and should be deterministic, if running a binary isnt deterministic you have undefined behavior in your program


[3/29/2023 7:54 PM] kuratius
this is really bad


[3/29/2023 7:55 PM] szybet

[3/29/2023 8:33 PM] kuratius
compiling a kernel should always require the private key


[3/29/2023 8:33 PM] kuratius
public is only to verify if the private key was known by the person compiling it


[3/29/2023 8:33 PM] kuratius
so I assume I probably just need to figure out how to get imgtool actually working I guess


[3/29/2023 8:34 PM] kuratius
but I'm not gonna do that with trial and error, I'll wait for someone to actually tell me how to run the script


[3/29/2023 8:34 PM] kuratius
it shouldnt be hard to explain


[3/29/2023 8:38 PM] szybet
No...


[3/29/2023 8:38 PM] szybet
We sign the rootfs, the apps etc with private keys


[3/29/2023 8:39 PM] szybet
With the public keys in the kernel


[3/29/2023 8:39 PM] szybet
Send me your image


[3/29/2023 8:42 PM] kuratius
it's way less of a hassle for you to just compile again and tell me the hash


[3/29/2023 8:42 PM] kuratius
I dont get why that's an issue

[3/31/2023 12:22 AM] kuratius
the proper way to debug is to go step by step, and compiling the kernel is a step *before* writing it to the image, so if there's an issue there then that has to be figured out first, but you aren't able to just give a hash and say which commit it is
that's frustrating

How to build the same Linux Kernel twice sources and get the same c...
I'm searching if it's possible to build the same Linux Kerneltwice (same sources, same environment, same options, same compiler) and get the same checksum.
Anybody knows how to do so?

stop with the hashes


[3/31/2023 12:25 AM] szybet
dont invent new problems


[3/31/2023 12:26 AM] szybet
flash the kernel i send you if it works then there is problem with your kernel compiling. if it doesnt, the problem is the image


[3/31/2023 12:26 AM] szybet
simple


[3/31/2023 1:03 AM] kuratius
Will try that later, ty

I looked it up and found a page listing all the things that need to be changed for a reproducible build
https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/reproducible-builds.html

Having reproducible builds is still best practice, so probably keep it in mind for later

Is this really the right offset?
I'm still getting a security policy violation, except this time it results in a bootloop


[3/31/2023 9:01 AM] kuratius
I can try deleting the flag again and see what happens


[3/31/2023 9:02 AM] szybet
Do it


[3/31/2023 9:02 AM] szybet
Yes, write it to mmcblk0 not a partition


[3/31/2023 9:03 AM] kuratius
Was this message meant for me or tux?


[3/31/2023 10:24 AM] kuratius
The flag doesn't exist


[3/31/2023 12:55 PM] szybet
for you?...


[3/31/2023 12:55 PM] szybet
you need to root it


[3/31/2023 8:14 PM] tux_linux
For you
It's the root flag


[3/31/2023 8:50 PM] kuratius
Why are there two dd commands and why does the second one not have an output file?


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] tux_linux
*input file?


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] tux_linux
Input is taken from echo
Piping


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] tux_linux
The other command is for flashing the kernel


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] kuratius
Typo maybe? If says input is the sd card


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
mario, you know?


[3/31/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
:D


[3/31/2023 8:52 PM] kuratius
And there's two dd commands, do both get the pipe input?


[3/31/2023 8:52 PM] kuratius
I'd expect only the first to get it

[3/31/2023 8:53 PM] kuratius
Then second dd command is incomplete


[3/31/2023 8:54 PM] kuratius
It specifies an input and an offset, but not output

[3/31/2023 9:06 PM] ninuje
input defaults to stdin


[3/31/2023 9:06 PM] ninuje
Hence the piping


[3/31/2023 9:07 PM] ninuje
Oh, wait, we're talking about the other one 😄


[3/31/2023 9:13 PM] tux_linux
The second one is used to check if it was correctly written


[3/31/2023 9:13 PM] tux_linux
It outputs to stdout


[3/31/2023 9:13 PM] szybet
cool

Seems like it might be interesting, though it's probably overkill (and apparently you can install the package manager on a normal distro anyway, so this might just be a distro optimized for making build containers)

We depend on people
This morning I was thinking of finishing 2.0 and pausing the project afterwards because so few people actually seem to be using it but I will see


[4/12/2023 10:58 PM] tux_linux
If we can get $@$$#@ Clara HD to be ported it would be great


[4/12/2023 10:58 PM] szybet
dont freeze it until i finish


[4/12/2023 11:11 PM] tux_linux
@everyone 
Anyone else interested in contributing to the project ? Probably been a year or so since last general ping but we need your support. Since Feb. 2022 only major and regular contributors were Szybet, NiLuJe and andi1. I really do appreciate small contributions (contributions from Clara HD porting thread and other threads as well) but it would be great if someone could get as involved as ourselves in the project and as such, we could start to create a real community. It can be anything, a wiki guru or a kernel wizard, but this project has to grow because it's looking like it's been doing stationary bike, developing itself so fast yet with so few people demonstrating sustained interest towards it.
Thanks...!


[4/12/2023 11:39 PM] ab201701
I unfortunately only have an elipsa and my ability to contribute productively is limited, unfortunately (skills, time). i wish i could help out in some way but i suspect i will slow things down too much.

[4/13/2023 5:22 AM] zilding
I have a Kobo Glo (maybe an HD?  I can't recall) that's been sitting in a box for a while kinda waiting for something useful to put on it.  I could certainly get involved.  I'm busy as heck with everything else so not huge amounts of time


[4/13/2023 12:16 PM] .ccache
I actually bought a Clara HD recently to play with, and I've got enough experience with embedded linux to be able to test stuff, but I'm no programmer and can't really deal with code.


[4/13/2023 12:17 PM] .ccache
Additionally the current image generation process is very fragile and awfully complicated, so I haven't had time to actually build an image yet


[4/13/2023 12:19 PM] tux_linux
Then we need more developers. Maybe try to forward the request (everyone) to some people you know that have some knowledge and could be interested in the project?


[4/13/2023 12:22 PM] .ccache
I think we need to fix the image building process first, because right now it's pretty complicated and rather error-prone


[4/13/2023 12:22 PM] szybet
~~learn to code?~~


[4/13/2023 12:22 PM] szybet

We dont need imgtool at all... Mannually compiling everything is not that hard

Unironically yes, but it's a long process, I'm not a smart cookie

Inkbox is modular, its not one big binary

We come really close to 2.0 release, I will take the time to try to improve it


[4/13/2023 12:23 PM] tux_linux

You don't need imgtool
You will learn things better if you do it manually

I have scripting experience and playbook writing with little to no experience in proper programming… but looking at the source code I almost feel like I can help somehow. Getting excited, going to try and make time to flash it on the libra 2 tomorrow. I’ll make a thread if I have time


[4/15/2023 4:20 AM] tux_linux
Sadly it is not supported for this model (yet), but perhaps you can help


[4/15/2023 4:24 AM] baahemian
That’s what I noticed. Saw one of the issues on the GitHub that was a dead end which is sorta kinda why I’m interested. I might not be terribly skilled at programming but I like to rush headlong into troubleshooting and trying to make sense of stuff. Have a backup kindle paper white to go to if I need to keep reading my current books.

I'm like 70% sure there's a drop of glue somewhere in the slot, it's just easy enough to get rid of with enough force

[4/16/2023 12:02 AM] szybet

um okay


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] szybet
weird


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] kuratius
It way easier to remove the sd after the first time, and the first time I used a small piece of metal to push it from the other side instead of pulling, and it felt like I dislodged something that was stuck


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] kuratius
Like breaking a seal or a glue connection


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] baahemian
!! That was a good idea. Just came out easily


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] szybet
maybe the slot is designed like that, like a plastic holding it or smth, i doubt glue


[4/16/2023 12:04 AM] baahemian
Yup. Hot glue

On the opposite end are two small holes you can see the end of the sd card

I used an esd safe tweezer to push it at the card level making sure not to touch any contacts


[4/16/2023 12:06 AM] szybet
as you have so profesional tools, maybe you have a soldering station to unsolder the sd card?

Is that glue?

It’s glue plus a small film probably used for waterproofing at the contacts

[4/16/2023 12:08 AM] szybet
if you want to be super save, unsolder the battery. just saying


[4/16/2023 12:09 AM] baahemian
Yeah that makes sense if I went further out I’d imagine. But at this stage removal of the sd card didn’t take any further disassembly… time to dump the contents of this card before flashing


[4/16/2023 12:10 AM] szybet
what do you plan to flash?...


[4/16/2023 12:12 AM] baahemian
Going to just go for putting the InkBox image on the card and start trying to troubleshoot it?


[4/16/2023 12:12 AM] baahemian
Probably won’t go super well but I’m willing to take a go at it I guess.

2 things you should be aware of 
By default you need a serial port to read debug output, but if you get screen output by coincidence, then you could enable a config option to print debug console output to the screen

[4/16/2023 12:15 AM] kuratius
Do the images attempt to boot if they detect that the device is unsupported?


[4/16/2023 12:15 AM] kuratius
I thought they were device specific


[4/16/2023 12:15 AM] szybet
uhm u-boot incompatibility, cpu incompatibility, kernel incompatibility

Makes sense. Honestly won’t be surprised if in this I end up destroying something but perhaps nothing is a better lesson than some heartbreak. 

But even that said, this is a step beyond anything I’ve done before. Thanks for the forewarning


[4/16/2023 12:17 AM] kuratius
At the very least you can now put in a super big sd card


[4/16/2023 12:18 AM] kuratius

~~if the size is supported~~


[4/16/2023 12:18 AM] baahemian
Can just swap things out with calibre wirelessly, which is fine


[4/16/2023 12:28 AM] baahemian
Okay… so if I understand what you mentioned @Kuratius  I would need to locate the pin location for serial on the board (I might have) then solder to that point to a pin out that can connect to either an arduino or pi via gpio to establish a serial connection? Still digging through the suggested porting threads to try and put together a checklist of what I need to get ready


[4/16/2023 12:29 AM] szybet
not gpio, othwewise yes


[4/16/2023 12:30 AM] baahemian
Hasty photo of the board… the four pin holes labeled “j3” look similar to the photos I’m seeing on some of these other boards but I know that doesn’t necessarily mean much. Sorry if I’m retreading something obvious here.

From the looks of it. Yeah I figured that, since it’s the J3.


[4/16/2023 12:32 AM] baahemian
I would need to desolder the battery (before doing anything else, really) but there’s a lot of empty space in this model.

Thanks Syzbet for helping me to slow down a bit yesterday, I was a little too eager. Looking at the board now and the free space. I think o should be able to wire some permanent header pins that can interface with a usb to serial adapter, and still close the thing up when not in use. There’s about 4-5mm of space from the plastic the board sits on to the highest point that can fit under the stock cover. I think if I wire the pins under the board and solder  on it should allow it to work; if the fit is too tight I can possibly print a back case. Want to try and keep this thing “functional” while testing by swapping sd cards.

[4/16/2023 8:30 PM] szybet
you want to do this on the serial pins?


[4/16/2023 8:31 PM] kuratius
I'm 70% sure they won't fit or stay in place


[4/16/2023 8:31 PM] baahemian
Perhaps not... they push out then clamp down, so who knows... Would be nice.


[4/16/2023 8:32 PM] szybet
i will just copy from the link


[4/16/2023 8:32 PM] szybet
```
first, serial connection
Use capton tape and add it below the serial pads because if you add too much solder, and the solder will touch the metal below, you will propably burn down the main cpu. You can eassly push it below the board without dissasembling it
```


[4/16/2023 8:32 PM] szybet
the same with those hooks


[4/16/2023 8:32 PM] szybet
so tldr bad idea


[4/16/2023 8:33 PM] szybet
if you want to do it directly onto the THT serial pins


[4/16/2023 8:35 PM] baahemian
Very nice guide you've written here. I'll keep this in mind. Like i mentioned (and probably made terribly obvious) I'm not terribly experienced in this, but curious enough to learn (and break things if needed). But I really appreciate the warnings, advice and patience with me so far 🙂

You can buy hardware open source hardware and they often come with open source software.
Whereas open source software is more nebulous.
People are probably staring/following/etc hoping to see some "come buy our foss ereader now!" announcement. Something that won't happen with inkbox.

What are your criteria


[4/23/2023 12:39 PM] kuratius
do you need something that fits in a pocket, do you need something that you can write with? Imo go to a store and see if you actually like the size first


[4/23/2023 12:39 PM] kuratius
do you need specific files (e.g. for pdfs you need a bigger screen otherwise it's uncomfortable)?


[4/23/2023 12:41 PM] kuratius
avoid buying a kindle if it's an option


[4/23/2023 12:41 PM] ahmad_dev
Yeah, the main thing I need is something for pdfs, with a blue light filter

[4/23/2023 12:46 PM] szybet
look for bigger screens like the aura, kobos are open so you can choose other software like plato, koreader, inkbox


[4/23/2023 12:47 PM] szybet
pdfs on small screens are pretty unusable


[4/23/2023 12:47 PM] ahmad_dev

[4/23/2023 12:49 PM] szybet
mainly kobo, pocketbook not so much ( not really at all, koreader only and thats a maybe ), tolino are kobos so also yes - other ereaders are pretty closed so its harder so no, only these brands

the reason why you only encounter nia users is that nia is the only one ereader with a downloadable image that is still in production


[4/23/2023 1:05 PM] szybet
kuratius also doesnt have this


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
what?


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] tux_linux
ummmm yes


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
um


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] tux_linux
Ok, good that the display's working at least


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
kuratius you also dont have this chip


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] kuratius
literally only bought a nia because I checked which ereaders had an inkbox release when buying


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] tux_linux
And touch seems as well


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] tux_linux
Power button should be trivial
*Cough*


[4/23/2023 1:06 PM] szybet
and then you gived up on inkbox... bro


[4/23/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
@mu88 can you please read the letters / numbers from the small chip that is diffrent?


[4/23/2023 1:07 PM] tux_linux
@andi would probably want to tune in


[4/23/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
+ make a picture of the bottom of the ereader where the button is


[4/23/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
@NiLuJe propably too as a koreader developer, look at this madness :D


[4/23/2023 1:08 PM] kuratius
correct, I have a different size chiplet in that spot


[4/23/2023 1:08 PM] szybet
those are really diffrent pcbs, i dont have this chip

[4/23/2023 1:09 PM] szybet
updating to 1.9 is not that bad


[4/23/2023 1:09 PM] tux_linux
1.9 was initial support release for nia


[4/23/2023 1:10 PM] szybet
they even changed the crystal oscilator next to the cpu

Kobo eReader
The Kobo eReader is an e-reader produced by Toronto-based Kobo Inc (a subsidiary of Rakuten). The company's name is an anagram of "book". The original version was released in May 2010 and was marketed as a minimalist alternative to the more expensive e-book readers available at the time. Like most e-readers, the Kobo uses an electronic ink scree...

[4/23/2023 1:11 PM] .mu88
@Szybet I've uploaded some more detail pictures from the chips


[4/23/2023 1:11 PM] kuratius
if you go to a store you usually wont find the others


[4/23/2023 1:11 PM] .mu88
are all relevant information there?


[4/23/2023 1:12 PM] szybet
@mu88


[4/23/2023 1:13 PM] szybet
thats the battery charging chip propably too, and it is smaller / has smaller coils arround it - it will get hotter for sure


[4/23/2023 1:13 PM] tux_linux
Then we will have to disable it or adapt it for this model


[4/23/2023 1:13 PM] tux_linux
I hope there is a way to differentiate between the two revisions from userspace


[4/23/2023 1:14 PM] kuratius
is the revision n306 or n307 or something?


[4/23/2023 1:14 PM] .mu88
n306


[4/23/2023 1:15 PM] kuratius
that seems annoying
I hope there is still a way to tell the board revision when buying


[4/23/2023 1:16 PM] tux_linux
that's the model number


[4/23/2023 1:16 PM] tux_linux
unless they go with n306b or n306c, probably not


[4/23/2023 1:17 PM] kuratius
is the code next to the battery a serial or a revision?


[4/23/2023 1:17 PM] szybet
at least the bottom is the same

HEY WHAT ABOUT THE KERNEL SOURCES FOR THIS THING?


[4/23/2023 1:17 PM] tux_linux
ok @mu88 please stay around and don't give up on this because recent nia users will not be able to get inkbox working on their kobos otherwise


[4/23/2023 1:17 PM] tux_linux
kernel source police


[4/23/2023 1:17 PM] .mu88

delete the part about the cristal oscilator, it doesnt affect anything, i just mentioned

[4/23/2023 1:26 PM] szybet
well then follow what tux linux showed


[4/23/2023 1:27 PM] szybet
maybe wasn't even released - those revisions are made because of IC prices, availability - when they developed B it was already not needed or smth ( theory to explain this madness )


[4/23/2023 1:27 PM] tux_linux
i updated the issue with serial numbers thing

kernel sources dont have anything to do with it


[4/23/2023 1:29 PM] szybet
please


[4/23/2023 1:29 PM] tux_linux
yes, but it still shows it's a different revision


[4/23/2023 1:29 PM] tux_linux
i already said it was not that relevant


[4/23/2023 1:29 PM] szybet
OK


[4/23/2023 1:31 PM] tux_linux
if we can get around the power button issue it can probably work with the current kernel but would be better to have real sources for battery and the rest


[4/23/2023 1:31 PM] tux_linux
this also means that ipd will make the reader go to sleep as soon as it can (probably)


[4/23/2023 1:31 PM] tux_linux
so, got to fix that as well


[4/23/2023 1:32 PM] .mu88
So do you want me to connect my Kobo with the Raspi? If yes, please let me know what I've to do - in this discussion so far I only see the newly created GitHub issue

[4/23/2023 1:34 PM] szybet
what why


[4/23/2023 1:34 PM] tux_linux
because it wants to go in diagnostics as soon as it boots up?


[4/23/2023 1:34 PM] tux_linux
diagnostics require power button input


[4/23/2023 1:34 PM] szybet
oh, propably yep

on your rpi
run
`minicom -D /dev/ttyS0 -b 115200 -w`


[4/23/2023 2:08 PM] tux_linux
you should see something appearing on the screen as the kobo boots


[4/23/2023 2:09 PM] .mu88
`-bash: minicom: command not found` - do I have to install some package?


[4/23/2023 2:10 PM] szybet

[4/23/2023 2:12 PM] andi15701
ok, so you and Kuratius  have the same board


[4/23/2023 2:12 PM] kuratius
I had to enable serial port in rpi config I think


[4/23/2023 2:13 PM] andi15701
so basically the only interesting then is the pre-partion spaces at mu88's Nia (which includes the devicetree)


[4/23/2023 2:13 PM] kuratius
also I am reading serial0 I think


[4/23/2023 2:13 PM] kuratius
(also obv minicom has to be installed)


[4/23/2023 2:16 PM] .mu88
`minicom: cannot open /dev/ttyS0: No such file or directory`


[4/23/2023 2:18 PM] tux_linux

minicom -D /dev/serial0

[4/23/2023 2:24 PM] .mu88

[4/23/2023 2:24 PM] .mu88
A new minicom shell opened and some extremely indented output is shown


[4/23/2023 2:25 PM] .mu88
and it updates from time to time (every 10 seconds I'd say)

I removed all cables, turned off via diagnostic mode, readded all cables, pushed the power button for four seconds (the Kobo still displays _Powered off_ afterwards) and connected via `minicom -D /dev/ttyS0 -b 115200 -w` - the session opens, but this time nothing changes:

[4/23/2023 2:51 PM] kuratius
serial port is weird


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] kuratius
you can also tell via the light at the power button if it's on


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] .mu88
you mean the minicom session must be opened before pushing the power button?


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] kuratius
yes


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] kuratius
no idea why


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] .mu88
The button is always off, except in diagnostics mode - if have absolutely no visual feedback


[4/23/2023 2:52 PM] kuratius
idk serial ports are weird


[4/23/2023 2:53 PM] kuratius
I think it turns itself off or something


[4/23/2023 2:53 PM] kuratius
that means it does something, then turns itself off


[4/23/2023 2:53 PM] kuratius
so if minicom wasnt running before it turned off you wont get anything


[4/23/2023 2:54 PM] .mu88
and shall I boot "normally" (i. e. push power button for three or four seconds) or into diagnostics?


[4/23/2023 3:02 PM] andi15701
libra2e sources seem to include stuff for newer version of nia


[4/23/2023 3:02 PM] szybet
w h a t


[4/23/2023 3:02 PM] andi15701
I would expect that the old nia also does run with those sources


[4/23/2023 3:02 PM] .mu88
I tried both and when booting "normally", simply nothing happens both visually on the Kobo and inside minicom. Only when booting into diagnostics, the power button's LED lights up for a couple of moments and I see the infinite output in minicom

that is from the kernel

MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Netronix event0 key driver");


[4/23/2023 5:19 PM] andi15701
so in the clara2e source, just the commented out ntx_event0 has to be commented in and the b00 devicetree is the same as in the binary

how do they know when updating things which one is which?>

and just copy over the kernel


[4/23/2023 5:23 PM] szybet
but the kernel is diffrent


[4/23/2023 5:24 PM] andi15701
the newer kernel should just work on the older device


[4/23/2023 5:24 PM] szybet
this is horrible for inkbox


[4/23/2023 5:24 PM] andi15701
the other way round, it is different


[4/23/2023 5:26 PM] andi15701
what probably needs to be changed is paths for battery status (or even better, scan the directory /sys/class_power_supply)


[4/23/2023 5:28 PM] tux_linux
so we just need to replace the dtb?


[4/23/2023 5:28 PM] szybet
+ update kernel


[4/23/2023 5:29 PM] andi15701
probably take the original stuff before first partition


[4/23/2023 5:29 PM] szybet
+ tell users to not fuck up choosing the image

Yeah, there are different HW revisions on the Nia, FWIW (that's true of basically all the current lineup, too)


[4/23/2023 6:31 PM] ninuje
Most common visible change being a different PMIC


[4/23/2023 6:31 PM] ninuje
(Which explains your power button issue, it gets shafted to a dedicated input device instead of the synthetic NTX event0)

[4/23/2023 6:37 PM] ninuje
TL;DR: Get me the output of  `ls -lash /dev/input/by-path` on that board on a stock kernel ;o)

[4/23/2023 6:40 PM] ninuje
And you guys probably have a logic issue somewhere there, because it should behave as if no power button events *at all* are observed, *NOT* being stuck with a power press?


[4/23/2023 6:41 PM] szybet
yep


[4/23/2023 6:42 PM] ninuje

what I'm trying to say it, try to open books at a reasonable speed, and try to get correct formatting before trying to get vertical text

delete any identifying information if you can, idk if this still contains anything tying it to me
What do you mean by id? Serial number?

it could be tied of who bought the ereader, which store etc


[4/27/2023 6:47 PM] kuratius
then sure, just mention where you modified it with a placeholder


[4/27/2023 6:48 PM] szybet
funny part: if you modify it then the default os will show it, i created an image where is says szybets image or something like that and its visible in settings :D

noice


[4/27/2023 6:48 PM] kuratius
anyway, prob fine to include it in the repo after stripping the serial

any interesting differences compared to your image?

also is the waveform actually different?

cool


[4/27/2023 6:52 PM] kuratius
just curious about it really


[4/27/2023 6:54 PM] kuratius
if I was serious about using it as an ereader and not just a toy I'd probably have to implement something that streams the framebuffer to the pico via wifi, so it's not out of the question to sidestep the software issue, but it wouldnt really be an ereader anymore, it'd be a shitty external phone screen


[4/27/2023 6:55 PM] kuratius
also for now I'll just try if it's possible to use the screen via gpio

Also I just wanted to peek in to say I’m still here,  but this  is definitely a project beyond my current skill set, although I’m trying to find where I can be useful 

I want to work, test or contribute down the line , but if there’s a donation portal as well for some of the developers I’d be happy to chip in there.

yea i know, i wasnt able


[5/1/2023 9:40 PM] kuratius
is the thingy dull for you?


[5/1/2023 9:40 PM] kuratius
might be not sharp enough


[5/1/2023 9:41 PM] kuratius
I mean the tip might be too large from usage

[5/1/2023 9:43 PM] dominiac
I dont really have smth dull I think


[5/1/2023 9:44 PM] kuratius
if you use metal you might just slice off the plastic latches instead of unlocking them


[5/1/2023 9:44 PM] szybet
yrp, this


[5/1/2023 9:45 PM] dominiac
ok I could 3d print something like this


[5/1/2023 9:45 PM] dominiac
have you ever tried?


[5/1/2023 9:45 PM] kuratius
I don't own a 3d printer and I dunno if the tip can be 3d printed well enough


[5/1/2023 9:46 PM] kuratius
you can try if you want but these thingies are super cheap anyway


[5/1/2023 9:46 PM] kuratius
2-3 € I think on amazon


[5/1/2023 9:48 PM] dominiac
ok I'll risk it with this tool, its kinda dull so it should not damage much


[5/1/2023 9:48 PM] dominiac
you guys know where are the latches?


[5/1/2023 9:48 PM] dominiac
more on the corner or on the center?


[5/1/2023 9:48 PM] szybet
propably start from the up


[5/1/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
avoid usb port


[5/1/2023 9:49 PM] dominiac
got it


[5/1/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
idk where the flex cable is


[5/1/2023 9:49 PM] szybet

:D


[5/1/2023 10:07 PM] szybet
well a channel for "teaching" would be helpfull, @tux-linux spamming dev is not a good idea


[5/1/2023 10:07 PM] kuratius
one thing you could consider for later if you want optimal image quality, the inkbox images copy the waveform from someone else's device, but they're technically custom for each device so make a backup of the original sd card so you can overwrite the waveform on the inkbox image later


[5/1/2023 10:08 PM] szybet
nah its propably good


[5/1/2023 10:09 PM] kuratius
*shrugs*


[5/1/2023 10:09 PM] szybet
if you won't notice diffrence, then well


[5/1/2023 10:09 PM] szybet
but a backup always good


[5/1/2023 10:11 PM] dominiac
well I'm afraid I have no idea what are you talking about xd


[5/1/2023 10:11 PM] dominiac
whats the wave form


[5/1/2023 10:11 PM] kuratius
just a screen calibration for eink screens


[5/1/2023 10:11 PM] dominiac
haa I see


[5/1/2023 10:11 PM] kuratius
basically telling it how to refresh the screen for optimal contrast and sharpness


[5/1/2023 10:12 PM] dominiac
got it


[5/1/2023 10:12 PM] dominiac
how do I make it ''custom''


[5/1/2023 10:12 PM] dominiac
for mine


[5/1/2023 10:12 PM] dominiac
or maybe I should worry about that later?


[5/1/2023 10:12 PM] kuratius
there is some unpartitioned space on the sd card where you can copy it, but like I said you can also worry about it later


[5/1/2023 10:13 PM] kuratius
the unpartitioned space has the waveform in the same location on both inkbox and the original image, so you can use dd if you know the offset


[5/1/2023 10:13 PM] dominiac
gotcha

[5/1/2023 10:15 PM] szybet
wot


[5/1/2023 10:15 PM] kuratius
only thing you should do now is just backup the sd card, rest can be later


[5/1/2023 10:16 PM] szybet
anything other happens?


[5/1/2023 10:16 PM] kuratius
prob
dd if=/dev/sdCard of=koboBackup.img bs=512 
and then wait a while
I cant remember if this dd command needs sudo


[5/1/2023 10:16 PM] kuratius
prob add the progress option too


[5/1/2023 10:17 PM] dominiac
not really? I just got into the apps panel

nop


[5/1/2023 10:18 PM] szybet
try ti reproduce it


[5/1/2023 10:18 PM] szybet
power button hold for long idk 15s and then turn it on


[5/1/2023 10:20 PM] dominiac
if I click on the pwer button it sleeps


[5/1/2023 10:20 PM] szybet
click it for longer

ha there u go


[5/1/2023 10:21 PM] dominiac
it worked


[5/1/2023 10:21 PM] szybet
try to reproduce it


[5/1/2023 10:21 PM] dominiac
1s


[5/1/2023 10:23 PM] dominiac
its taking its time


[5/1/2023 10:31 PM] dominiac
huh


[5/1/2023 10:31 PM] dominiac
now it didnt reproduce


[5/1/2023 10:31 PM] dominiac
strange


[5/1/2023 10:33 PM] szybet
well we hope either it won't happen again or if it happens you will be able to fix it at this point


[5/1/2023 10:34 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/1/2023 10:35 PM] szybet

noob question: how do I connect to the computer?


[5/1/2023 10:37 PM] dominiac

[5/1/2023 10:37 PM] szybet
with a usb cable


[5/1/2023 10:37 PM] szybet
or wifi ssh if you root it


[5/1/2023 10:37 PM] dominiac
it does not apear on my system


[5/1/2023 10:37 PM] dominiac
2s


[5/1/2023 10:38 PM] dominiac
nvm fixed it


[5/1/2023 10:38 PM] szybet
😄


[5/1/2023 10:40 PM] dominiac
how do I back up the sd card?


[5/1/2023 10:40 PM] dominiac
do I cd into the device and then use the commands?


[5/1/2023 10:40 PM] szybet
gnome disk tool


[5/1/2023 10:40 PM] szybet
:D


[5/1/2023 10:40 PM] kuratius
sudo fdisk -l would tell you where the sd card is


[5/1/2023 10:41 PM] kuratius
but you can also do what szybet recommended and use a disk backup tool


[5/1/2023 10:41 PM] kuratius
you do not need cd


[5/1/2023 10:41 PM] kuratius
it'd be bad to use cd bc you'd end up writing the image to the sd card


[5/1/2023 10:41 PM] kuratius
(that's bad)


[5/1/2023 10:42 PM] dominiac
got it kekw


[5/1/2023 10:46 PM] kuratius
there's probably an argument to be made that using raw dd commands is the easiest way to accidentally overwrite your own drive and as such a diskbackup tool is safer


[5/1/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
for clarification, of=filename is where it will try to write the image, if it's not an absolute path it will create the image in the current directory


[5/1/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
so if the current directory is the sd card, you're writing to the sd card while copying it


[5/1/2023 10:49 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/1/2023 10:49 PM] dominiac
what *bs* stand for?


[5/1/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
block size


[5/1/2023 10:50 PM] kuratius
you can also omit it I think the default is 512 anyway


[5/1/2023 10:50 PM] kuratius
and I think using it doesnt change the image, just how quickly or slowly the image is copied


[5/1/2023 10:51 PM] kuratius
status=progress would add a progress bar


[5/1/2023 10:51 PM] kuratius
type "man dd" to see a help page


[5/1/2023 10:52 PM] ninuje
Something thinks its drawing to an 8bpp fb while the fb is actually @ 32bpp


[5/1/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
it happened only once


[5/1/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
cant replicate eassly


[5/1/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
any ideas?


[5/1/2023 10:53 PM] ninuje
You'd have to have switched the fb to 32bpp somehow, to begin with


[5/1/2023 10:53 PM] ninuje
As the bootup state is 16bpp


[5/1/2023 10:54 PM] ninuje
So I'd start looking at what can actually do that


[5/1/2023 10:55 PM] kuratius
ereader wasnt shutdown correctly before removing sd card maybe?


[5/1/2023 10:55 PM] kuratius
as in original sd card


[5/1/2023 10:55 PM] ninuje
Not possible


[5/1/2023 10:55 PM] ninuje
Because this


[5/1/2023 10:56 PM] ninuje
But, in any other non-full conversion scenarios, yeah, my best guess would have been you caught Nickel's startup sequence


[5/1/2023 10:57 PM] ninuje
(As, on a stock firmware, the fb state goes from bootup state, to pickel state for the boot anim, to Nickel's state; and the first and only 32bpp state is Nickel's)


[5/1/2023 11:01 PM] dominiac
well I changed the font size on the first setup


[5/1/2023 11:01 PM] dominiac
maybe it had something to do with it?


[5/1/2023 11:01 PM] dominiac

[5/1/2023 11:42 PM] szybet
propably couldn't run if not mainline kernel


[5/1/2023 11:42 PM] kuratius
I thought wayland was supposed to be faster and less buggy than xorg


[5/1/2023 11:43 PM] szybet
i'm just quessing


[5/1/2023 11:43 PM] kuratius
the kernel argument prob applies to inkbox, yeah


[5/1/2023 11:43 PM] kuratius
though with inkbox you only need org for x11 aps right? everything else is qt?


[5/1/2023 11:43 PM] szybet
for all those old apps you would need to run xwayland which would be heavier for sure

[5/2/2023 8:12 PM] szybet

[5/2/2023 8:15 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/2/2023 8:15 PM] dominiac
but I'm not sure if its because of the software


[5/2/2023 8:15 PM] dominiac
or if its because its 2nd handed


[5/2/2023 8:16 PM] dominiac
you see, it seems like it doesent work for too long if its not pluged into power


[5/2/2023 8:16 PM] dominiac

look at this


[5/2/2023 9:48 PM] szybet
cool guide


[5/2/2023 9:48 PM] dominiac
btw what are this keys used for


[5/2/2023 9:48 PM] dominiac
why do we need them


[5/2/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
veryfication that the software is official


[5/2/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
only we can sign updates that the system will accept


[5/2/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
you are replacing them so you can update it


[5/2/2023 9:50 PM] szybet
if the update server would be hacked, it's impossible to push a harmfull update because of this


[5/2/2023 9:50 PM] dominiac
hum I see


[5/2/2023 9:51 PM] dominiac
so to make sure:

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/image-60699.png


[5/2/2023 9:51 PM] szybet
if you would make contributions to inkbox, we would share the key with you so you can more eassly test stuff etc


[5/2/2023 9:52 PM] dominiac
is this what I should do now?


[5/2/2023 9:52 PM] szybet
not exactly, it's not your model


[5/2/2023 9:52 PM] szybet
its for the clara and you have the glo


[5/2/2023 9:52 PM] szybet
there is a directory for the glo, diffrent number


[5/2/2023 9:53 PM] dominiac
ha yes besides that


[5/2/2023 9:53 PM] dominiac

did you did kernel?

you generated one pair of keys, and replaced them in kernel?

[5/3/2023 2:21 PM] dominiac
what you mean by using the pair of keys


[5/3/2023 2:22 PM] dominiac
do I copy them everywhere


[5/3/2023 2:22 PM] dominiac
or do I use their path


[5/3/2023 2:23 PM] szybet
both


[5/3/2023 2:23 PM] szybet
copy better


[5/3/2023 2:23 PM] szybet
you dont generate any other keys


[5/3/2023 2:23 PM] dominiac
ok so


[5/3/2023 2:24 PM] dominiac
if I understand correctly


[5/3/2023 2:24 PM] dominiac
then the keys are created on build/inkbox path is it?


[5/3/2023 2:24 PM] dominiac
the private and public


[5/3/2023 2:25 PM] dominiac
here

[5/3/2023 2:30 PM] szybet
what


[5/3/2023 2:30 PM] szybet
now


[5/3/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
you use only one pair of keys everywhere


[5/3/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
no new created


[5/3/2023 2:32 PM] dominiac
sure but where are they


[5/3/2023 2:33 PM] tux_linux
It's supposed to be run on the target architecture, i.e. your Kobo


[5/3/2023 2:35 PM] szybet
what


[5/3/2023 2:35 PM] dominiac
like, in witch folder are they


[5/3/2023 2:36 PM] dominiac
of is this a dumb question to ask


[5/3/2023 2:36 PM] dominiac
maybe this is one of those kek


[5/3/2023 2:39 PM] szybet
eeewhat is where


[5/3/2023 2:39 PM] dominiac
the keys


[5/3/2023 2:39 PM] dominiac
they are here arent they


[5/3/2023 2:39 PM] dominiac
just to make sure


[5/3/2023 2:40 PM] dominiac
the ones I have to use


[5/3/2023 2:40 PM] szybet
in kernel, where you replaced them


[5/3/2023 2:40 PM] szybet
and now you sign the software using those keys


[5/3/2023 2:42 PM] dominiac
here?

[5/3/2023 2:42 PM] szybet
in one of those squash file systems


[5/3/2023 2:42 PM] szybet
right?


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
haa


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
so squash is a compressed read only file


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
didnt know that


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] szybet
something like that


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
got it


[5/3/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
ok so


[5/3/2023 2:45 PM] dominiac
how to I use this files as keys everywhere


[5/3/2023 2:45 PM] dominiac
do I just use their path?


[5/3/2023 2:46 PM] dominiac
the thing we where talking about earlyer


[5/3/2023 2:46 PM] szybet
what areyou talking about


[5/3/2023 2:46 PM] dominiac
hold on


[5/3/2023 2:46 PM] dominiac
brb in 1h +/-


[5/3/2023 3:32 PM] dominiac
ok I'm back


[5/3/2023 3:34 PM] dominiac
so this command worked


[5/3/2023 3:34 PM] dominiac
whats next


[5/3/2023 3:35 PM] dominiac
maybe I can understand the key things later


[5/3/2023 3:35 PM] szybet

[5/3/2023 3:39 PM] dominiac
ok done


[5/3/2023 3:39 PM] szybet
did we did gui-rootfs?


[5/3/2023 3:40 PM] dominiac
no?


[5/3/2023 3:40 PM] dominiac
what was suppose to be done there


[5/3/2023 3:41 PM] szybet
the same as in rootfs


[5/3/2023 3:41 PM] szybet
identical


[5/3/2023 3:41 PM] szybet
but for diffrent files


[5/3/2023 3:41 PM] dominiac

is it?


[5/3/2023 3:42 PM] szybet
yep


[5/3/2023 3:42 PM] szybet

[5/3/2023 3:43 PM] dominiac
this two?


[5/3/2023 3:43 PM] szybet
yes, but replace the path & file names


[5/3/2023 3:43 PM] dominiac
but for gui


[5/3/2023 3:43 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/3/2023 3:47 PM] dominiac
``` openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /home/build/inkbox/private.pem -out gui-rootfs.squashfs.dgst gui-rootfs.squashfs ```


[5/3/2023 3:47 PM] dominiac
like this?


[5/3/2023 3:47 PM] szybet
ye


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] dominiac
``` openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /home/build/inkbox/private.pem -out rootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.squashfs ``` this one didnt work


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] dominiac
ok both didnt work


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] szybet
.


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] szybet
did you run release?


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] szybet
script


[5/3/2023 3:48 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/3/2023 3:49 PM] dominiac
sudo env GITDIR=$PWD ./release.sh


[5/3/2023 3:49 PM] dominiac
this one


[5/3/2023 3:49 PM] szybet
did you get gui-rootfs.squashfs file?


[5/3/2023 3:49 PM] szybet
outside of gui-rootfs dir?


[5/3/2023 3:49 PM] szybet
in the parent dir


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] dominiac
oh yea


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] dominiac
its outsite


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] dominiac
I put it inside the folder then


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] szybet
no


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] szybet
doesnt matter


[5/3/2023 3:50 PM] szybet
run this where the file is


[5/3/2023 3:52 PM] dominiac
ok


[5/3/2023 3:52 PM] dominiac
this one worked


[5/3/2023 3:52 PM] dominiac
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /home/build/inkbox/private.pem -out gui-rootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.squashfs


[5/3/2023 3:53 PM] dominiac
what now


[5/3/2023 3:53 PM] dominiac
next spteperino


[5/3/2023 3:53 PM] szybet
no


[5/3/2023 3:54 PM] szybet
you need to understand a bit what you are doing to make it


[5/3/2023 3:54 PM] szybet
here you created `gui-rootfs.squashfs.dgst` by signing `rootfs.squashfs`


[5/3/2023 3:54 PM] szybet
it doesnt make sense right?


[5/3/2023 3:55 PM] szybet
gui-rootfs and rootfs are 2 diffrent things


[5/3/2023 3:55 PM] szybet
where is gui-rootfs.squash


[5/3/2023 3:59 PM] dominiac
the only one I have is *gui-rootfs.squashfs.dgst* an then I got a rootfs.squashfs inside the gui-rootfs


[5/3/2023 4:02 PM] szybet
move rootfs.sqhashfs back to the parent directory


[5/3/2023 4:02 PM] szybet
and in this parent directory run `ls` and show output


[5/3/2023 4:02 PM] szybet
and remove gui-rootfs.squashfs.dgst

[5/3/2023 4:35 PM] szybet

I think


[5/3/2023 4:46 PM] szybet
name


[5/3/2023 4:46 PM] szybet
is diffrent


[5/3/2023 4:47 PM] szybet
no squashfs, only isa...


[5/3/2023 4:47 PM] dominiac
HA


[5/3/2023 4:48 PM] dominiac
I get it now


[5/3/2023 4:48 PM] dominiac
ok done


[5/3/2023 4:49 PM] szybet
do you have write access to your sd card


[5/3/2023 4:49 PM] dominiac
I think so


[5/3/2023 4:51 PM] szybet
enter the dir where zimage was created


[5/3/2023 4:51 PM] szybet
kernel repo


[5/3/2023 4:51 PM] szybet
sudo dd if=zImage-root of=/dev/sdcard bs=512 seek=81920


[5/3/2023 4:51 PM] szybet
zimage is name of your zimage file


[5/3/2023 4:52 PM] szybet
and /dev/sdard replace with the sd card ***whole*** disk file


[5/3/2023 4:52 PM] szybet
before executing command post it here


[5/3/2023 4:55 PM] dominiac
where is that


[5/3/2023 4:56 PM] dominiac
ha wait


[5/3/2023 4:56 PM] dominiac

[5/3/2023 4:58 PM] szybet
ye


[5/3/2023 4:59 PM] dominiac
mine is uImage-root


[5/3/2023 5:00 PM] dominiac

[5/3/2023 5:04 PM] dominiac
sudo dd if=uImage-root of=/dev/sdd bs=512 seek=81920


[5/3/2023 5:05 PM] szybet
if its your sd card then its fine, launch it

now in gui-bundle dir navigate to out folder, find update.isa and copy the file to partition 4 update fir ( ** in this dir should be a file, overwrite it** )


[5/3/2023 5:45 PM] dominiac
ook

[5/3/2023 5:53 PM] szybet
did i forgot something


[5/3/2023 5:53 PM] szybet
you replaced gui-rootfs too?


[5/3/2023 5:53 PM] dominiac
yes


[5/3/2023 5:54 PM] szybet
type sync 3 times in terminal


[5/3/2023 5:54 PM] szybet
then unmount every partition safely


[5/3/2023 5:55 PM] szybet
plug the sd card to the ereader


[5/3/2023 5:55 PM] szybet
stop


[5/3/2023 5:55 PM] szybet
actually


[5/3/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
move to your pc ( remove on sd card ) files associated with overlaymount-rootfs, recovery


[5/3/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
and then do this


[5/3/2023 5:58 PM] dominiac
I remove from sd card?


[5/3/2023 5:58 PM] szybet
yes. but have a copy of those files on pc


[5/3/2023 5:58 PM] dominiac
roger


[5/3/2023 6:02 PM] dominiac
what does that do?


[5/3/2023 6:02 PM] dominiac
like sync and ender 3 times or like sync sync sync?

[5/3/2023 6:09 PM] szybet
did you replaced also the dgst for sure?


[5/3/2023 6:10 PM] szybet
and those were signed using the same key pair that you replaced in the kernel?


[5/3/2023 6:10 PM] dominiac
I'm pretty sure but I'll do the procedure again


[5/3/2023 6:10 PM] szybet
did you replaced them in the kernel correctly?


[5/3/2023 6:11 PM] szybet
like have you overwritten the keys that were there already>


[5/3/2023 6:11 PM] dominiac
in the sd card?


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
no, before compiling kernel in the kernel repo


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] dominiac
damm maybe not

[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
do it then


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
with the same keys


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
then write the kernel as before


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
and try again


[5/3/2023 6:12 PM] szybet
compile it again

reboot once more


[5/3/2023 6:55 PM] dominiac
how much time do I have to press to reboot


[5/3/2023 6:56 PM] szybet
15s


[5/3/2023 6:56 PM] szybet
then idk 2 to power it up


[5/3/2023 6:57 PM] dominiac
damm same error


[5/3/2023 6:58 PM] szybet
are you sure you did that with the same key?


[5/3/2023 6:58 PM] szybet
that you signed rootfs?


[5/3/2023 6:58 PM] dominiac
1s I'll do everyting again


[5/3/2023 6:58 PM] szybet
```
You can now check if the squashfs contains your public.pem by mounting it.

```


[5/3/2023 6:58 PM] szybet
show me


[5/3/2023 6:59 PM] szybet
something is wrong with this line


[5/3/2023 6:59 PM] szybet
show me inside of the squashfs


[5/3/2023 7:02 PM] dominiac
``` applications-public.pem   kobox-graphic-public.pem   kobox-nographic-public.pem   public.pem ```


[5/3/2023 7:03 PM] szybet
check if its your public.pem


[5/3/2023 7:03 PM] szybet
md5sum it


[5/3/2023 7:03 PM] szybet
and the one you use to sign rootfs


[5/3/2023 7:08 PM] dominiac
md5sum public.pem /dir/public.pem -> like that?


[5/3/2023 7:08 PM] szybet
md5sum <path to file>


[5/3/2023 7:09 PM] dominiac
haa


[5/3/2023 7:09 PM] dominiac
they are different


[5/3/2023 7:09 PM] dominiac

will continue +/- 1h


[5/3/2023 11:37 PM] dominiac
ok so error nº3 pretends only to a rootfs.squashfs problem right, therefore ether I'm creating the files wrong or transfering them wrong into the sd card

Are you sure you did the kernel corrwct


[5/4/2023 6:50 PM] dominiac
```sudo unsquashfs kernel/initrd/n437/opt/key.sqsh

[5/4/2023 6:51 PM] dominiac
is there more to do in the kernel?


[5/4/2023 6:51 PM] dominiac
did I miss something?


[5/4/2023 6:52 PM] szybet
How do you write it the sd card


[5/4/2023 6:53 PM] dominiac
```sudo dd if=uImage-root of=/dev/sdd bs=512 seek=81920  ```


[5/4/2023 7:04 PM] dominiac

If there sre no errors, then its fins


[5/4/2023 8:21 PM] dominiac
well yes


[5/4/2023 8:22 PM] dominiac
I used this command to copy the keys into the sd card:


[5/4/2023 8:22 PM] dominiac
``` sudo cp /home/build/inkbox/rootfs/rootfs.squashfs /run/media/dominiac/rootfs/  ```


[5/4/2023 8:23 PM] dominiac
and then the same but for the dgst file as well


[5/4/2023 8:23 PM] dominiac
is that correct?


[5/4/2023 8:33 PM] szybet
Yes


[5/4/2023 8:34 PM] szybet
are ypu sure it overwrittet?


[5/4/2023 8:34 PM] szybet
Check checksums... For everything

@tux-linux how to replace / overwrite developer key


[5/4/2023 8:34 PM] szybet
😬


[5/4/2023 8:36 PM] szybet
If you check everything with checksums and it doesnt work... Place the original rootfs.squashfs and the dgst for this file on the sd card and check if the error changes


[5/4/2023 8:47 PM] dominiac
yes to make sure, I delete the files in the sd card and then cp them back into it


[5/4/2023 8:50 PM] szybet
thjen this


[5/4/2023 9:13 PM] dominiac
checked they are the same


[5/4/2023 9:15 PM] dominiac
what else could it be


[5/4/2023 9:23 PM] szybet
.


[5/4/2023 9:26 PM] dominiac
yes thats what I did


[5/4/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
What


[5/4/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
and whats the result


[5/4/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
With the original rootfs


[5/4/2023 9:30 PM] dominiac
the same


[5/4/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
Then you are using diffrent keys...


[5/4/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
Or something is horribly wrong


[5/4/2023 9:33 PM] szybet
Sign again the rootfs with the same key you coppied to kernel


[5/4/2023 9:34 PM] szybet
I will propably prepare all those files for you

[5/5/2023 3:27 AM] tux_linux
developer key isn't even supposed to be installed


[5/5/2023 3:28 AM] tux_linux
to check for sure
`dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=256 skip=159746 count=1`
should output `0` for disabled or `1` for enabled
if it has never been installed before, it should output nothing

[5/6/2023 2:27 PM] tux_linux
but it doesn't always work


[5/6/2023 2:27 PM] szybet
welp


[5/6/2023 2:27 PM] tux_linux
how did you come to have a book of this name


[5/6/2023 2:28 PM] dominiac
what name


[5/6/2023 2:28 PM] dominiac
the 1º one?


[5/6/2023 2:28 PM] dominiac
I have no idea about that one


[5/6/2023 2:28 PM] dominiac
its not just the book name tho


[5/6/2023 2:28 PM] szybet
?

but its caused by the book


[5/6/2023 2:29 PM] szybet
trust me


[5/6/2023 2:29 PM] dominiac
ha


[5/6/2023 2:29 PM] tux_linux
oh i think it's because capital letters in the second one


[5/6/2023 2:29 PM] tux_linux
they take up more space in average


[5/6/2023 2:29 PM] tux_linux
i think

[5/6/2023 2:30 PM] dominiac
see the time


[5/6/2023 2:30 PM] tux_linux
click on power icon
then
restart inkbox


[5/6/2023 2:31 PM] szybet
dont click reader, send an image of the main menu


[5/6/2023 2:31 PM] dominiac
on it


[5/6/2023 2:31 PM] dominiac
waiting for it to restart rn


[5/6/2023 2:32 PM] dominiac
yes youre right


[5/6/2023 2:33 PM] dominiac
it was because of the book name

hum alright alright


[5/6/2023 2:36 PM] dominiac
I see


[5/6/2023 2:37 PM] dominiac
now the next step: how do I install your apps 👀


[5/6/2023 2:37 PM] szybet
what apps


[5/6/2023 2:37 PM] dominiac
dont remember if there was documention about that


[5/6/2023 2:37 PM] szybet
there are a few


[5/6/2023 2:38 PM] dominiac
If I remember correcly you ported anki into inkbox didnt you?


[5/6/2023 2:38 PM] dominiac
that one I'm particularry intrested


[5/6/2023 2:39 PM] szybet
yea but its outdated ***but*** im doing a complete rewritew of it, 80% is already completed


[5/6/2023 2:39 PM] szybet
I added sessions which will allow to use many decks at the same time


[5/6/2023 2:39 PM] szybet
in a week or less i will release it


[5/6/2023 2:40 PM] szybet
you can try it now if you want, by compiling it by yourself


[5/6/2023 2:40 PM] szybet
+ eink optimisations


[5/6/2023 2:40 PM] szybet
not ported, its more like a **s**mall **anki**, a viewer for the decks ( still usable tho for learning )


[5/6/2023 2:43 PM] dominiac
ha so a program you made to view the decks made by anki?


[5/6/2023 2:43 PM] szybet
yep


[5/6/2023 2:43 PM] szybet
no editing etc


[5/6/2023 2:43 PM] szybet
easier to use ( less functions )


[5/6/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
in teory it could be ported no? its gui kit is QT


[5/6/2023 2:44 PM] szybet
eink & touchscreen & speed focused


[5/6/2023 2:44 PM] szybet
ported to what


[5/6/2023 2:44 PM] dominiac
to inkbox


[5/6/2023 2:44 PM] szybet
read the description of the project

/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/sanki-528E5


[5/6/2023 2:46 PM] dominiac
I mean anki itself


[5/6/2023 2:47 PM] szybet
oh


[5/6/2023 2:47 PM] szybet
anki? hell no maybe


[5/6/2023 2:47 PM] szybet
its written in 3 languages: cpp, python, rust


[5/6/2023 2:47 PM] szybet
python is slow, the main algorithm is written in python so the app would be horribly slow


[5/6/2023 2:48 PM] szybet
and compiling it, with this mix would be awfull


[5/6/2023 2:48 PM] szybet
with problems with anki itself, i decided to write my own app


[5/6/2023 2:51 PM] dominiac
ha I seee I see


[5/6/2023 2:52 PM] dominiac
well as long as it has all the features relevant to a ink tablet and it can open anki decks it funtually does the same work


[5/6/2023 2:52 PM] szybet
the algorithm to view the decks will be worse


[5/6/2023 2:53 PM] szybet
no schedulling for next days for example


[5/6/2023 3:38 PM] dominiac
yet? 👀


[5/6/2023 3:39 PM] szybet
not at all, propably

long answer:
I "pretend" the anki algorithm, it's not perfect, If you have an idea how to add to mine a scheduling way, then sure


[5/6/2023 3:39 PM] szybet
there will be a way to view cards only that were "hard" to learn


[5/6/2023 4:01 PM] feoras_fael
I assume the InkBox does not work with calibre right? 😄


[5/6/2023 4:01 PM] szybet
Only because no one cared


[5/6/2023 4:01 PM] szybet
You can add support


[5/6/2023 4:02 PM] szybet
You can make a github issue, if like 5 people will want it I will add it propably


[5/6/2023 4:03 PM] szybet
The Worst option: You can donate a bit to me / *propably not tux linux he isisn't interested* and I will add it with no more questions asked


[5/6/2023 4:16 PM] feoras_fael
Okay I will think about it, thanks!


[5/6/2023 4:16 PM] szybet
😄


[5/6/2023 7:24 PM] dominiac
alright so


[5/6/2023 7:25 PM] dominiac
do you have some pointers on how to make a aplication for inkbox?


[5/6/2023 7:26 PM] dominiac
I create the application on QTCreator right

when you connect to inkbox os via ssh, to launch qt apps you need to `/chroot /kobo`

any questions, ask

this is the only server i dont have muted so i will respond

do you have a background in programming?


[5/6/2023 7:28 PM] szybet
also, what app do you plan to make?


[5/6/2023 7:29 PM] dominiac
well yea I'm still learning atm, I know the basic stuff mostly


[5/6/2023 7:29 PM] szybet
good then


[5/6/2023 7:30 PM] dominiac
dunno, something simple like a fancy hello world or so. that way I can explore how things work +/- and how to debug stuff


[5/6/2023 7:30 PM] szybet
okay cool


[5/6/2023 7:30 PM] szybet
you can grab sanki code and play with it


[5/6/2023 7:32 PM] dominiac
lets goo


[5/6/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux

I have not been able to do much more yet, I have stuff to do for uni :[


[5/9/2023 10:04 PM] dominiac
tho I have been playng arround with QT Creator


[5/9/2023 10:05 PM] dominiac
now that you mention, do you recommend any site to download books?


[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] szybet
for what purpoose?


[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] dominiac
any purpoose


[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] dominiac
the books I downloaded so far makes the reader block


[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] szybet

[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] szybet
?


[5/9/2023 10:06 PM] dominiac
I beleave is duo to the images


[5/9/2023 10:07 PM] szybet
block?


[5/9/2023 10:07 PM] dominiac
yes, it loads the 1º page of the book and then it stays there non responding


[5/9/2023 10:08 PM] dominiac
not sure if its because of the format of the book or not, thats why I'm asking


[5/9/2023 10:08 PM] szybet
um oops


[5/9/2023 10:08 PM] szybet
pdfs should do


[5/9/2023 10:08 PM] szybet
send me those books, i will have a look when i develop the new one


[5/9/2023 10:08 PM] szybet
epubs should do too


[5/9/2023 10:09 PM] dominiac
epubs work so far, tho without images


[5/9/2023 10:09 PM] dominiac
but pdfs not really


[5/9/2023 10:09 PM] szybet
weird


[5/9/2023 10:10 PM] dominiac
are you gonna make another reader?


[5/9/2023 10:10 PM] dominiac
why not using a available reader on linux?


[5/9/2023 10:10 PM] dominiac
like a very simple one


[5/9/2023 10:11 PM] dominiac
or maybe forking a it into inkbox


[5/9/2023 10:11 PM] dominiac
is it just easyer to make another one? xd


[5/9/2023 10:14 PM] szybet
I mean, reusing the gui of the existing one and rewriting the logic to be multi threaded - better - faster


[5/9/2023 10:15 PM] szybet
Its not that simple.....

[5/10/2023 12:20 AM] ninuje
Also, there just aren't any to begin with?


[5/10/2023 12:20 AM] ninuje
There's foliate and calibre, basically


[5/10/2023 12:21 AM] ninuje
webkit-gtk + vala or webengine + PyQt, choose your poison


[5/10/2023 12:21 AM] tux_linux
foliate already looks bad

{Attachments}
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/image-1291B.png


[5/10/2023 12:21 AM] ninuje
It's ePub.js in webkit-gtk and a vala GUI, IIRC


[5/10/2023 12:22 AM] tux_linux
coolreader seems cool (pun not intended but hey here you go) but honestly having to deal with a pixmap instead of characters kinda freaks me out


[5/10/2023 12:23 AM] ninuje
It might sound weird coming from me given that KOReader uses CRe; but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it


[5/10/2023 12:23 AM] tux_linux
Yes, when you explained how it worked I was slightly terrified


[5/10/2023 12:24 AM] ninuje
It has a lot of weird quirks, most or which stems from its history

{Reactions}
👍 

[5/10/2023 12:24 AM] ninuje
It's basically a crazy twenty years old russian hack designed for PalmOS


[5/10/2023 12:24 AM] ninuje
It's very cool, mind you, but it's really, really starting to show its age

{Reactions}
👍 

[5/10/2023 12:25 AM] ninuje
I have zero experience with any of its official GUIs, though (and I probably wouldn't recommend them anyway)


[5/10/2023 12:25 AM] tux_linux
they are *fine*


[5/10/2023 12:25 AM] tux_linux
but lack some QoL/GUI nice things


[5/10/2023 12:25 AM] ninuje
Which is why mupdf is a good fallback, it doesn't actually have a GUI, and the API is pretty nice


[5/10/2023 12:26 AM] ninuje
Which is perfect for us


[5/10/2023 12:26 AM] tux_linux
yes, it is, but sometimes it also bugs out for no reason

anyway, does anyone know a way to sniff a linux process network communication in a readable way? apart from wireshark


[5/10/2023 12:28 AM] ninuje
What's wrong with wireshark? ;o)


[5/10/2023 12:29 AM] ninuje
If the traffic is encrypted you're going to have a hard time regardless, as you'll then need extra trickery to break SSL, which usually involves having deep control over part of your network


[5/10/2023 12:30 AM] ninuje
networking is not my forte, though


[5/10/2023 7:55 AM] szybet
i just want to debug the "gui" XD


[5/11/2023 12:14 AM] .ccache

[5/16/2023 6:18 PM] szybet
so about that nia kernel things in the clara sources, where?...


[5/16/2023 6:18 PM] szybet
there was something, you discovered it?


[5/16/2023 6:18 PM] andi15701
I will ping that guy


[5/16/2023 6:19 PM] szybet
okay?


[5/16/2023 6:19 PM] szybet
thanks


[5/16/2023 6:20 PM] andi15701
there is: arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6ull-e60u22b00.dts


[5/16/2023 6:20 PM] andi15701
and that looks like the devicetree of that thing


[5/16/2023 6:20 PM] andi15701
and the drivers seems to be there


[5/16/2023 6:20 PM] andi15701
of that nia new edition thing


[5/16/2023 6:21 PM] szybet
so there is a diffrent one? its propably not compatible?


[5/16/2023 6:21 PM] andi15701
at least two devicetrees needed for the different nias


[5/16/2023 6:22 PM] andi15701
imx6sll-e60k02c00* is probably for the clara2e


[5/16/2023 6:22 PM] szybet
i had hopes it was compatible, only the driver was missing


[5/16/2023 6:23 PM] andi15701
kobo seems to have switched the factory kernel of the old nias also to something newer supporting also the other pmic


[5/16/2023 6:24 PM] szybet
only drivers, not the whole kernel?


[5/16/2023 6:24 PM] andi15701
that is what you need


[5/16/2023 6:24 PM] andi15701
from analysis of Kuratius' nickel dmesg output


[5/16/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
so nickel is running on a newer one? cool...


[5/16/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
to patch up the old nia kernel?


[5/16/2023 6:26 PM] andi15701
well, most important thing is that the kernel has the drivers needed


[5/16/2023 6:27 PM] andi15701
and if the devicetree says that there is the corresponding hardware, the drivers are then used


[5/16/2023 6:28 PM] andi15701
well, newer kernel= also some defaced 4.1.15 kernel


[5/16/2023 6:29 PM] andi15701
apparently kobo/netronix backported the pmic (bd-something) driver for libra2e/nia rev b/c from mainline to their old kernel


[5/16/2023 6:29 PM] szybet
well okay


[5/16/2023 6:29 PM] szybet
how to do that then


[5/16/2023 6:31 PM] andi15701
probably just compile the clara2e kernel


[5/16/2023 6:31 PM] szybet
????????????????????


[5/16/2023 6:31 PM] andi15701
and put it on the nia


[5/16/2023 6:31 PM] andi15701
the only important thing is that you put the right devicetree onto the sd card


[5/16/2023 6:32 PM] szybet
device tree is the thing you wrote a tool to export?


[5/16/2023 6:32 PM] andi15701
yes


[5/16/2023 6:33 PM] andi15701
well, the tool exports all the hidden partion stuff


[5/16/2023 6:33 PM] andi15701
devicetree: in source form that are the .dts files in the kernel source


[5/16/2023 6:33 PM] andi15701
in binary: some dtb files


[5/16/2023 6:33 PM] szybet
it isin't just dd the file right? how to convert it to binary?


[5/16/2023 6:34 PM] andi15701
make CROSS_COMPILE=...... ARCH=arm dtbs


[5/16/2023 6:34 PM] andi15701
in the kernel tree


[5/16/2023 6:34 PM] szybet
and then dd it?


[5/16/2023 6:35 PM] andi15701
usually store it in a file accessible by the bootloader


[5/16/2023 6:35 PM] andi15701
in the case for that ntx bootloader: prepend a header


[5/16/2023 6:36 PM] andi15701
and do the dd


[5/16/2023 6:37 PM] szybet
we will figure this out or ask later, thanks


[5/16/2023 6:38 PM] szybet
this sounds a bit insane, so the kernels are the same for those devices?


[5/16/2023 6:39 PM] andi15701
I really would think so


[5/16/2023 6:39 PM] .mu88
I'm completely lost, guys 😬


[5/16/2023 6:39 PM] szybet
me too bro


[5/16/2023 6:40 PM] szybet
download this, and try to compile


[5/16/2023 6:41 PM] andi15701
well, in the ideal world, you would publish one kernel git repo supporting all devices


[5/16/2023 6:41 PM] szybet
i know


[5/16/2023 6:41 PM] andi15701
and for new, similar devices, you would just add the devicetree


[5/16/2023 6:42 PM] andi15701
what I see here from ntx/kobo: they seem to have one 3.0.35 code base and one 4.1.15 code base


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] andi15701
and add support for different devices to it


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] ninuje
Yeah, never ever assume the sources on their github are up to date


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] ninuje
They're not


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] ninuje
Nickel is almost always running a newer build


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] szybet
we know that


[5/16/2023 6:43 PM] andi15701
and publish some snapshots


[5/16/2023 6:44 PM] .mu88
How do I compile it? What tools do I need?


[5/16/2023 6:44 PM] andi15701
so if there is a devicetree for a new device


[5/16/2023 6:44 PM] andi15701
and the drivers


[5/16/2023 6:44 PM] andi15701
i would expect the device to be supported

Just for my understanding: why do I have to use the Clara kernel for my Nia? Because the assumption is that Clara is the newer one and therefore fits for my Nia as well?


[5/16/2023 6:53 PM] szybet
yea, @andi how


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] szybet
but propably yes


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] ninuje
It's basically the same device, but the kernel snapshot is newer and ensures it actually has the dtb for yours, or at the very least the drivers for the newer hardware ;o)


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] andi15701
well, they did not publish newer nia sources


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] ninuje
Unlike the original Nia's drop


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] ninuje
TL;DR


[5/16/2023 6:54 PM] andi15701
so for a first try you can also just keep the factory dtb in place


[5/16/2023 6:55 PM] ninuje
And, yeah, dumping the dtb from your live device first might be a good idea


[5/16/2023 6:55 PM] andi15701
and recompile just the kernel


[5/16/2023 6:55 PM] .mu88
dtb means?


[5/16/2023 6:55 PM] ninuje
In case it's not actually there or still out of date in the source drop


[5/16/2023 6:55 PM] andi15701
devicetree binary


[5/16/2023 6:56 PM] ninuje
(I ship the devicetree tools in KoboStuff, in case something funky is needed to dump from a live system. Can't recall, been a while)


[5/16/2023 6:56 PM] .mu88
So from the manual, the very only chapter I should follow is https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/blob/main/inkbox.md#kernel?

Short story long 😁 I was looking for an E-Ink device to display my openHAB dashboard. After discovering InkBox, I bought a refurbished Nia and hoped that InkBox would suffice my needs with some kind of "easy going approach" - but now it's getting a little out of control 😜 just too much low-level stuff for me... do you see any other approach?


[5/16/2023 7:11 PM] .mu88
For example I could imagine to swap my Nia for another InkBox device that suffices my needs and donate my fresh Nia to your project...


[5/16/2023 7:12 PM] andi15701
well, if it is not about reading ebooks anymore, than maybe even something other than inkbox might fit


[5/16/2023 7:13 PM] andi15701

Do you have an older Kobo that successfully works with the latest version of InkBox? I really don't care about reading ebooks or the latest hardware - I only need a more or less modern browser on an E-Ink device being always on

A browser will suck donkey balls on it, though

postmarketOS on the Kobo Clara HD
jetomit managed to figure out how to boot a mainline Linux kernel on the Kobo Clara HD, an ereader from 2018.

I'm running the Sxmo UI on it to test, most of the Sxmo UI is optimized for the PinePhone though so it's pretty hard to actually use a bunch of things. Mainly due to missing 2 of the 3 hardware input buttons.

Looks like InkBox is a dead end with my current Kobo... Do you have any other ideas?

dont you think porting inkbox is easier than writing an entire website in bare fbink?...


[5/17/2023 7:21 PM] kuratius
does it really need to be a website`?

@Kuratius @andi could you please try to run demo.openhab.org on postmarketOS? Maybe it's better for me to wait for the Kobo Nia's version of postmarketOS...

andi1 already did

Ah yeah, I see... so maybe I'm going to wait


[5/18/2023 1:18 AM] tux_linux
@mu88 if you want that thing so bad, run an Xvfb server in a remote computer and access it with a vnc viewer on kobo. Then you can run firefox in the xvfb server (i.e. `DISPLAY=:1 firefox` probably) and access it that way


[5/18/2023 1:18 AM] tux_linux
with 256mb of ram, even postmarketos won't probably be able to load that website without crashing

[5/18/2023 7:37 PM] ninuje
Caveat for sunxi devices, where the display driver reserves an hilarious amount of memory (on the upside, the Elipsa has 1G of RAM)


[5/18/2023 11:42 PM] tux_linux
How much


[5/18/2023 11:43 PM] tux_linux
Yes
Older devices are often stuck with 256m though
Glo HD is a notable exception

Something like 192MB or something? I'd have to check, but it's hilarious.

@andi for that kobo nia c: how sure are you the clara kernel would work? and the current kernel booted into recovery - eink and touch work - does this indicate that it would work with the stock one?


[5/24/2023 3:08 PM] szybet
the current kernel booted into this recovery - with the same dtb as the regular nia - this should be a disaster, but it wasn't? what is your opinion on that?


[5/24/2023 5:10 PM] andi15701
I am quite sure that the clara*2e* kernel should work


[5/24/2023 5:12 PM] andi15701
well, looking at the dtbs, it seems that boot state of regulators is good enough to have something working


[5/24/2023 5:12 PM] andi15701
what definitively will not work is rtc, proper poweroff/reboot and displaying battery state

regulator voltages are in the devicetree

you say this now?


[5/24/2023 8:41 PM] szybet
i thought its kernel dependent, so a wrong kernel would damage the device


[5/24/2023 8:42 PM] andi15701
Well, the kernel needs to have the driver for the regulator


[5/24/2023 8:43 PM] andi15701
and the format of that devicetree section must match the expectation of the kernel

I come with a question..
Back in 2014 I was playing with my kobo Mini and installed the debian image on it. (The one from Marek Gibek)
I'm unable to do it again because I don't have that old sdcard, I gave the Mini away. 
It was given back to me just today.
The Mini image of Debian is long gone from the sites... 
And the year is no longer 2014, there are newer software solutions.

I have a funny objective:
To run discord on the Mini. Don't ask why. It has wifi. Can Kobox do that? 
From what I gathered, Inkbox on the Mini contains Kobox apps and the Mini can run Inkbox.
I was thinking the web version of Discord could be possible?
Or am I just crazy for wanting to try that...

I have no idea which channel to use for this, but well. If I was to buy a new e-reader with this in mind (being able to use discord in either its web or app form, after installing different OS) 
Is there any that is powerful enough/could do it?
It seems very specific, but I'm essentially trying to turn an e-reader into a tablet with limited options.

Buy an ereader or tablet that runs android


[6/15/2023 3:32 PM] kuratius
Otherwise you will have constant  headaches because ereaders are usually not running android.  Using more optimized software and apps means better battery life, that's why android isn't that popular for ereaders.


[6/15/2023 3:35 PM] kuratius
Lenovo smart paper, boox, etc run android


[6/15/2023 3:36 PM] kuratius
Though you should not bank on it being possible to install a different OS


[6/15/2023 3:37 PM] kuratius
Lenovo Smart paper has a chance of that since I heard it uses similar hardware as the pineNote thingy, but that one doesn't have a usable non-android os yet


[6/15/2023 3:38 PM] kuratius
Also worth mentioning, discord is not optimized software


[6/15/2023 3:42 PM] kuratius
It's based on electron, lags like hell, and it's a buggy pos in general.
I've had times where it mixed messages from different servers and people, and confused who the sender was


[6/15/2023 3:43 PM] kuratius
The more you can get away from anything Web tech based, the less you have to buy new hardware in the future

Thank you for the extensive answer. I'm looking up the ones you mentioned..


[6/15/2023 3:53 PM] kuratius
scratch that, tolino vision 6 runs android, libra 2 doesnt
I thought there was a kobo with android too, will check

(also dont take this table at face value, the person who made it doesnt really know what they're doing)


[6/15/2023 3:58 PM] kuratius
they still havent fixed kobo readers having an sd card slot


[6/15/2023 3:58 PM] kuratius
still says no slot


[6/15/2023 9:41 PM] Deleted User
So I decided to purchase an android e-reader. I guess that's the end of this - since I won't be using kobox or inkbox, there is no reason to stay here.
Thank all of you for all the help! I would be bashing against the glass of incompatibility like a moth if not for you xD

I use a boox note 2 air plus, works quite good


[6/15/2023 9:41 PM] tux_linux
expensive though


[6/15/2023 9:46 PM] Deleted User
I chose boox tab ultra c, which is very expensive but since I am searching for a device to use instead of computer and I have savings, it seemed appropriate.
Anyway.
Good luck!

aayy


[6/19/2023 1:43 PM] kuratius
basically the same formula that I derived


[6/19/2023 1:44 PM] kuratius
only difference is instead of q they have epsilon zeta


[6/19/2023 1:46 PM] kuratius
also I think I know what may have happened with the display tux ruined with a wrong waveform


[6/19/2023 1:47 PM] kuratius
the patent says that it can happen that the particles stick together and form clumps


[6/19/2023 1:47 PM] kuratius
so if you drive the display in the same direction for too long you probably get clumps at the electrode as the particles bunch up and don't repel each other


[6/19/2023 2:03 PM] szybet
So too high voltage?

So it would be possible to create a waveform that would be maybe not great, but wouldnt damage the screen?


[6/19/2023 2:04 PM] tux_linux
kindle touch has that


[6/19/2023 2:05 PM] kuratius
I think it's partially voltage and partially not applying that voltage when a pixel is already black.
Like, you can apply a higher voltage for a short time if the pixel is white and you are trying to drive it black


[6/19/2023 2:06 PM] kuratius
you mean the waveform?


[6/19/2023 2:06 PM] kuratius
sorry context is not clear


[6/19/2023 2:07 PM] kuratius
I'd say that's probably correct, you have more freedom to play around with the waveform if you use a slower refresh/lower voltage


[6/19/2023 2:08 PM] kuratius
but still eink burn in/damage is something I've not heard about in a long time


[6/19/2023 2:08 PM] tux_linux
yes it has a 'default' waveform with a lot of imperfections but that is embedded in kernel code to work with any device


[6/19/2023 2:08 PM] kuratius
so maybe modern displays have safeguards or better engineered microparticles that dont bunch up easily, or "unclump" after a while

most of our newcomers always did that


[6/25/2023 4:50 PM] alexanderi96
So, I'm not so fluent in this stuff. Never debugged a boot process before and stuff like that, but I know that it is the bootloader of many devices. Not totally sure if it is stored on the first sectors of the memory card or not

[6/26/2023 11:53 AM] szybet
and propably, it's not supported. You could help porting it


[6/26/2023 11:53 AM] spagettio
Gotcha, I've never done porting before but it sounds interesting


[6/26/2023 11:53 AM] szybet
some compiling / debugging / linux stuff


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] spagettio
Worst case scenario I'll back up the SD card and try one of the existing ports, I ran some random Linux port on it a while back haha


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
dont do it


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] spagettio
I mean that I can do


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
its more complicated than that, you could damage your eink screen or even start a fire, don't


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] spagettio
I just did it on a separate SD card


[6/26/2023 11:54 AM] szybet
what did you did


[6/26/2023 11:55 AM] spagettio
Interesting, didn't know that was a possibility


[6/26/2023 11:56 AM] spagettio
A while back I flashed the Linux release to the sd card after taking a full backup of it, plugged it in, realised it was for a different sized screen model, reflashed the backup, and then didn't think about it for quite a while


[6/26/2023 11:56 AM] szybet
good that nothing happened

It's a Glo


[6/26/2023 12:48 PM] tux_linux
Supported but you write the image to the internal SD card
And you make a backup of it before


[6/26/2023 12:48 PM] spagettio

[6/26/2023 12:51 PM] tux_linux
Did you use the custom Debian image thing?


[6/26/2023 12:52 PM] spagettio
Something like that, I believe it was Debian, it came as multiple partitions, I got it running but the screen was off (the image wrapped around weirdly) so I think it was for a slightly different model


[6/26/2023 12:52 PM] spagettio
So I ended up just flashing back the factory os


[6/26/2023 12:53 PM] tux_linux
Did it say it was for Glo


[6/26/2023 12:54 PM] spagettio
I really don't remember


[6/26/2023 12:54 PM] spagettio
This was about a year ago


[6/26/2023 12:54 PM] spagettio
I think it was but not completely sure


[6/26/2023 12:54 PM] tux_linux

him the kindle thing


[6/26/2023 9:37 PM] rs_matr1x
no i get it


[6/26/2023 9:37 PM] rs_matr1x
i did my research


[6/26/2023 9:38 PM] tux_linux
Why do you want it on a Kindle if you have a Mini


[6/26/2023 9:39 PM] rs_matr1x
why not !


[6/26/2023 9:39 PM] rs_matr1x
I have a few e-readers I tend to collect them


[6/26/2023 9:41 PM] rs_matr1x
got a kobo clara HD from clearance at walmart last year, got a kobo aura n514 (unsupported) from thrift store, got a kobo mini, got an old sony ereader.


[6/26/2023 9:41 PM] tux_linux
i probably have more than 10 ereaders at home too


[6/26/2023 9:41 PM] tux_linux
i "collect" them in the porting process


[6/26/2023 9:43 PM] rs_matr1x
My mini touchscreen has been unresponsive since I changed out the screen from aliexpress since the previous one had a dead pixel, but it's probably fixable I just haven't bothered


[6/26/2023 9:46 PM] rs_matr1x
anyways if I find a supported model amazon kindle for less than $20 at a thrift store I just think it'd be fun to have a good open source OS on it just out of spite for Amazon


[6/26/2023 9:47 PM] rs_matr1x
it'd be nice to see a completely open hardware ebook reader running on inkbox OS one day though


[6/26/2023 9:48 PM] szybet
if the project will be very succesfull, i could design it


[6/26/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
i have a bit of experience with pcb design & case design & 3d printing


[6/26/2023 9:49 PM] szybet
so if you want it, help it to be successful


[6/26/2023 9:52 PM] rs_matr1x
would it really need anything more powerful than an rpi zero 2w though


[6/26/2023 9:52 PM] szybet
i exactly plan to use that or a clone of it


[6/26/2023 9:58 PM] rs_matr1x
well I look forward to seeing what you come up with 🙂


[6/26/2023 9:59 PM] szybet
it will never happen if the project loses interest


[6/26/2023 10:00 PM] rs_matr1x
kind of a catch-22


[6/26/2023 10:00 PM] szybet
?


[6/26/2023 10:00 PM] rs_matr1x
if ebook readers are seen by people as good enough as is, people won't seek out alternative firmwares or alternative hardware


[6/26/2023 10:01 PM] rs_matr1x
especially if replacing a firmware is too difficult for most people


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] rs_matr1x
if theres an open source OS like inkbox paired with open hardware that goes above and beyond what a kindle or kobo reader offer, people will perhaps take more interest


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] szybet
inkbox already offers more


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] tux_linux
pinenote:


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] rs_matr1x
its interesting to note that a web search for inkbox brings up a majority results some sort of tattoo company


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] tux_linux
yes but no one cares


[6/26/2023 10:02 PM] szybet
its too expensive anyway


[6/26/2023 10:03 PM] szybet
i think inkbox should focus on cheap ereaders


[6/26/2023 10:03 PM] rs_matr1x
like what sort of features do people want?  I guess reading comicbooks, perhaps a weather report screensaver type mode, or a flip clock mode


[6/26/2023 10:03 PM] tux_linux
flip clock is cool


[6/26/2023 10:03 PM] szybet
ye we plan to add such things


[6/26/2023 10:04 PM] tux_linux
i added it to todo


[6/26/2023 10:04 PM] szybet
perhaps user apps?


[6/26/2023 10:04 PM] tux_linux

[6/26/2023 10:04 PM] tux_linux

You have to have the will to port it yourself

good times 🙂


[7/1/2023 2:08 AM] tux_linux
We are two people working on this and receiving almost no donations, so we can't buy every Kobo device ever 😉
We will be pleased to help you port it if you want, but you need the will to do it


[7/1/2023 2:08 AM] kghenderson
out of curiosity, do you have a patreon?

hello, popped in because i just got a Kobo Glo HD a little while ago and decided to try InkBox... having some trouble with KoBox apps


[7/2/2023 7:29 PM] szybet
Hello, well which ones


[7/2/2023 7:38 PM] milankolia
all of them, they start up in two small windows side by side (while the touch actions still think it's full screen)


[7/2/2023 7:39 PM] szybet
which version of inkbox do you have


[7/2/2023 7:39 PM] milankolia
2.0 for the Glo HD


[7/2/2023 7:39 PM] szybet
eh...


[7/2/2023 7:39 PM] szybet
@tux-linux problems


[7/2/2023 7:43 PM] szybet
@milankolia its hard to use xorg on eink screens, we have spend a long time on this and there are still problems. Consider helping us in any way ( root the device, gather logs... )


[7/2/2023 7:46 PM] milankolia
yeah, i can try gathering more information about this bug


[7/2/2023 7:46 PM] szybet
can you into linux?


[7/2/2023 7:47 PM] milankolia
yeah, i use Linux on my main machine


[7/2/2023 7:47 PM] szybet
good, cool


[7/2/2023 7:47 PM] szybet
first root the device in diagnostics mode


[7/2/2023 7:56 PM] milankolia
how do i do that? and oh, by the way, my Kobo has some trouble with USB connection


[7/2/2023 7:56 PM] szybet
usb port damaged propably?


[7/2/2023 7:56 PM] milankolia
yeah, might be


[7/2/2023 7:56 PM] szybet
reboot the device, spam the power button while turning on


[7/2/2023 7:57 PM] szybet
you will enter diagnostics, select root and thats it


[7/2/2023 7:59 PM] milankolia
"reset and allow root access"?


[7/2/2023 8:09 PM] szybet
yes


[7/2/2023 8:09 PM] szybet
it will reset


[7/2/2023 8:09 PM] szybet
so no books


[7/2/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
oh no


[7/2/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
does it do that every single time?


[7/2/2023 8:10 PM] tux_linux
well, rooting it could help, only that fact, even without debugging


[7/2/2023 8:11 PM] milankolia
i had nothing on it yet as i just got into testing it. the reset asks for onboard storage size, do i go with default 64MB?


[7/2/2023 8:11 PM] szybet
go with 512


[7/2/2023 8:11 PM] tux_linux
min. 256


[7/2/2023 8:12 PM] szybet
this should be automatic anyway


[7/2/2023 8:12 PM] szybet
@tux-linux balena etcher is resizing the last partition in such a way that a fsck on the file system enables to use the whole sd card, not only the specified space


[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] milankolia
yeah, it's consistent. also, even when i managed to quit something, it'd just halt and the only thing i could do is shut it down


[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] tux_linux
?


[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] tux_linux
ok, root it
and it means i've not done my job correctly :/


[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] szybet
it works for the nia tho


[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] szybet

[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] szybet

{Reactions}
🥴 

[7/2/2023 8:13 PM] milankolia
i used dd to make the SD card, i was going to just resize manually


[7/2/2023 8:14 PM] szybet
well its low level stuff, not for you


[7/2/2023 8:14 PM] milankolia
currently "Restoring"


[7/2/2023 8:14 PM] tux_linux
can take ~20m

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/2/2023 8:14 PM] milankolia
did it with the original Kobo firmware when changing the SD card with no problem


[7/2/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux
resizing it on inkbox is more complicated


[7/2/2023 8:16 PM] szybet
well as i said @tux-linux


[7/2/2023 8:16 PM] szybet
fsck, some math on onboard size, 1h of resizing and its done


[7/2/2023 8:17 PM] milankolia
the wiki says to do it anyways, using growpart and resize2fs


[7/2/2023 8:17 PM] tux_linux
not only growing a partition


[7/2/2023 8:18 PM] tux_linux
but well, you can follow the wiki as well


[7/2/2023 8:20 PM] milankolia
the splash screen came up already


[7/2/2023 8:21 PM] tux_linux
ok, start it, test kobox again and if it works then it means i've not done my job properly again


[7/2/2023 8:22 PM] milankolia
i think it's still pondering stuff behind that splash screen, but yeah, i'll do that

Hi


[7/2/2023 10:26 PM] liberodark
Ok this model have usb-c ?


[7/2/2023 10:27 PM] szybet
We talked with the developers - pine doesnt supply devices to developers and we dont have the funds to buy them


[7/2/2023 10:27 PM] liberodark
I can provide you with one for free.


[7/2/2023 10:27 PM] szybet
No, only kobo clara 2E has a usb c port, and its not supported, you would need to port it


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] szybet
What


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] liberodark
arf ok


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] liberodark
Yes


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] szybet
How


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] szybet
Or donate enough money for us to buy and then port


[7/2/2023 10:28 PM] szybet
But uhm thats a lot


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] kuratius
if someone gets their hands on one of these, there is a pmOS port for it and there are ways to port inkbox for a lot faster since you already have a booting kernel in that case


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] kuratius
also likely lenovo smart paper is easier to get than the pineNote and has similar hardware


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] liberodark
have try pmos on pinephone


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] kuratius
so probably check if the smart paper allows flashing a different OS


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] szybet
Does it have a linux kernel working?


[7/2/2023 10:29 PM] kuratius
it's more about the kernel and driver stuff


[7/2/2023 10:30 PM] kuratius
It has an android port, but that's not normal linux


[7/2/2023 10:30 PM] szybet
I doubt it, lenovo uses android


[7/2/2023 10:30 PM] kuratius
android open source project is what it runs


[7/2/2023 10:30 PM] kuratius
same SoC as the pine Note


[7/2/2023 10:30 PM] kuratius
so maybe minimal changes needed


[7/2/2023 10:31 PM] kuratius
rk3566 or something


[7/2/2023 10:31 PM] szybet
Porting from android to linux is hard, most of the cases impossible ( thats why we dont have many linux phones )


[7/2/2023 10:31 PM] liberodark
It is also possible.
I'm quite a fan of your work I think it's good to have an solution oss for Kobo even if I don't use kobo I'll take one to use your OS. But I have a big preference for the PineNote


[7/2/2023 10:31 PM] szybet
No...


[7/2/2023 10:32 PM] kuratius
like I said likely the existing pineNote pmOS only needs a few things to get it to boot

They often have out of stock.
I will directly ask.

[7/2/2023 10:34 PM] liberodark
Yep have read this wiki


[7/2/2023 10:34 PM] kuratius
there is already an OS for the pineNote


[7/2/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
Android uses diffrent drivers

Linux may not have them

If they dont share the pinout, or its not in the android source then there will be problems with finding connections between chips


[7/2/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
Arm is not PC - acpi, bios, standarisations dont exist


[7/2/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
You cant just ask the bridge if there is usb - there is no bridge


[7/2/2023 10:39 PM] kuratius
I guess we'd know more if the had images of the pcb


[7/2/2023 10:40 PM] kuratius
if they happen to have the same chips then that makes everything much more likely to work


[7/2/2023 10:40 PM] kuratius
for all I know the only difference is a different epd module


[7/2/2023 10:42 PM] liberodark
In any case as soon as I have the reader I will have it sent to you to @Szybet or @Kuratius as you want.


[7/2/2023 10:42 PM] liberodark
I hope to run Inkbox on this ereader. (one day)


[7/2/2023 10:42 PM] kuratius
probably send to @Szybet if you want a quick port, I just did a lot of logging for the Nia port, most of the work digging through docs and adjusting driver/kernel sources was from andi


[7/2/2023 10:43 PM] kuratius
(I say most - basically all of it)


[7/2/2023 10:43 PM] liberodark
Ok


[7/2/2023 10:43 PM] kuratius
how are you planning to get it?


[7/2/2023 10:43 PM] kuratius
is there some secret pine64 backchannel? or are you talking about the lenovo?


[7/2/2023 10:44 PM] liberodark
Im speak about pinenote (pine64)


[7/2/2023 10:44 PM] liberodark
I dont know lenovo ereader


[7/2/2023 10:44 PM] kuratius
so how are you going to get it? they are not manufacturing them right now


[7/2/2023 10:45 PM] liberodark
Two solutions either I will have to ask an acquaintance or when restocking

Maybe @tux-linux would want, he is the creator after all. But i want too, but we will see

Will we need to send the ereader back?


[7/2/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
Yea, pretty much this, so the kobo clara 2E would be a better target


[7/2/2023 10:49 PM] liberodark
I think your OS can be a good solution.


[7/2/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
they were told about it


[7/2/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
nothing to be done


[7/2/2023 10:49 PM] liberodark
I will ask from my side. it can be worth it if it is not possible I will do otherwise


[7/2/2023 10:51 PM] liberodark
Yes, you already need to have it to test.


[7/2/2023 10:51 PM] kuratius
it is not clear what you mean


[7/2/2023 10:52 PM] tux_linux
I want too 🥴


[7/2/2023 10:52 PM] kuratius
tux-linux speaks French, he is in Canada, szybet in Europe


[7/2/2023 10:52 PM] kuratius
maybe send to the one who is closer


[7/2/2023 10:52 PM] szybet
You have already 10 ereaders 🥴🥴


[7/2/2023 10:52 PM] tux_linux
I wrote the entire email


[7/2/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
What? How is this related


[7/2/2023 10:53 PM] liberodark
What I'm saying is only that I'll try to send you one as soon as I get my hands on it through the store or by some other means.


[7/2/2023 10:54 PM] tux_linux
Nvm send it to who you want
Of course if you encounter problems I will not be able to fix them as much but it would be the same thing if I had it so whatever


[7/2/2023 10:54 PM] tux_linux

[7/2/2023 10:55 PM] kuratius
also consider this:if you own 10 ereaders and szybet 2, then you need to test 10 and szybet only 2


[7/2/2023 10:56 PM] tux_linux
Yes
But idk


[7/2/2023 10:56 PM] kuratius

Hi, I’ve installed InkBox on a kobo mini which is working great, I see it’s possible to install on a kindle touch, just wondering if there is a guide I can look at to see how difficult it would be, I’ve got a couple of them in a draw doing nothing. Is there much soldering or anything?


[7/3/2023 8:09 PM] szybet
wait for @tux-linux


[7/3/2023 8:12 PM] wayneeee9069
Np 👍


[7/3/2023 9:21 PM] tux_linux
Are they original Kindle Touch?


[7/3/2023 9:21 PM] tux_linux
From 2011


[7/3/2023 9:24 PM] wayneeee9069
Hi, yeah the are the 2011 touch versions.


[7/3/2023 10:10 PM] tux_linux
It involves completely wiping the original firmware
Then reflashing the device with InkBox
Probably w/ fastboot
Probably no serial or soldering required


[7/4/2023 8:06 AM] wayneeee9069
Ok, I think it’s something for a weekend project then, is there a guide you have or anything?


[7/4/2023 8:20 AM] wayneeee9069
I’m happy to give it a go, no bother if i break one as they don’t get used.


[7/4/2023 8:25 AM] wayneeee9069
Sorry for the questions I’ve just been googling is mfgtool what you use? Or is it all command line?


[7/4/2023 8:26 AM] szybet
cli


[7/4/2023 8:26 AM] szybet
tldr: tux-linux needs to create the Kindle image and i dont know if he will have the time and will to do that


[7/4/2023 8:28 AM] wayneeee9069
Ok, well I’m happy to be a test dummy if he does, I could probably try to record it as a guide on the 2nd one if it worked on the first one.

Hey, I got here through the website, I have an old kindle 4 and I was curious to know if the kindle touch image would work on the 4 as well, since they're in the same generation. The project looks really great by the way, bravo to all involved!

[7/8/2023 9:58 AM] rs_matr1x
Is it possible to install inkbox and run it from the secondary microSD of an original model kobo glo while keeping the original internal kobo OS intact?  I know you can boot from the second SD slot if you hit the light button while turning it on, but it doesn't seem to boot.


[7/8/2023 10:00 AM] rs_matr1x
just gives a white screen


[7/8/2023 10:56 AM] szybet
@tux-linux


[7/8/2023 10:56 AM] szybet
If it doesnt work then it could be done


[7/8/2023 10:56 AM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[7/8/2023 1:34 PM] tux_linux
no


[7/8/2023 1:34 PM] tux_linux
it's impossible because u-boot only changes `root=/dev/mmcblkxpx` variable in kernel args
it still loads kernel from mmcblk0


[7/8/2023 1:36 PM] szybet
linux kernel can load another kernel


[7/8/2023 1:36 PM] szybet
in theory


[7/8/2023 1:36 PM] tux_linux
well, the point here is to boot it without alteration of the internal sd


[7/8/2023 1:36 PM] tux_linux
so, no use here


[7/8/2023 7:08 PM] rs_matr1x
i wonder if i take the internal kobo microSD and put it in the secondary microSD and tell it to boot from there if it'll load.  that'll be an experiment


[7/8/2023 7:09 PM] szybet
this certainly can be done


[7/8/2023 7:09 PM] szybet
everything is possible

[7/10/2023 10:25 PM] tux_linux
you will not be able to import your kobo library unless
1. the books don't have drm, you can use a plugin for that
2. the books are pdf files


[7/10/2023 10:25 PM] szybet
1. We would, or you need to port ultimate ranga reader to kobo

Hey, I've got two questions:

1. Is there a way to save reading preferences like text size and margin spacing so when I leave a book and come back to it I don't have to readjust?
2. Is there a way to set a photo instead of the sleep screen?


[7/13/2023 12:12 AM] tux_linux
1. What does the screen look like when you first open settings?
2. Yes, throw images in a folder named `.screensaver` in onboard storage

just look


[7/13/2023 5:17 PM] szybet
so for qt:
```
sudo mkdir -p /home/build/inkbox
```
and give permission to that folder for your user


[7/13/2023 5:17 PM] szybet
there, in that folder clone this repo https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/compiled-binaries


[7/13/2023 5:18 PM] szybet
and looking at that repo and the guide, you should be able to figure out how to create a qt creator kit


[7/13/2023 5:18 PM] szybet
then, look at those scripts:https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/tree/main/apps-on-kobo/inkbox-scripts

[7/13/2023 5:18 PM] szybet
and here is everything you need for qt


[7/13/2023 5:19 PM] szybet
as for backend - pick a project you want to tinker with and i will write a guide for it


[7/13/2023 5:19 PM] szybet
look at inkbox organisation, there are many parts of the system


[7/13/2023 5:19 PM] szybet
also root your devices in diagnostics if you havent already


[7/13/2023 5:19 PM] szybet
for any questions, feel free to ask them


[7/13/2023 5:20 PM] dobamuffin
Wondering about this


[7/13/2023 5:20 PM] dobamuffin
Also what backend components are in desparate need of another set of hands?


[7/13/2023 5:23 PM] szybet
when the device boots, spam the power button, in diagnostics mode there will be something about rooting, click it


[7/13/2023 5:25 PM] szybet
desparate i dont think any - but improvements for sure
Inkbox power daemon - cpp, musl, manages a lot of things
explore_local_library - shell script, improvement / rewrite in something better would be good
inkbox ( backend code ) - cpp / qt, we need code improvements because its not good
init - plain c, needs a lot of c magic


[7/13/2023 5:25 PM] szybet
maybe there are more


[7/13/2023 5:27 PM] dobamuffin
What's up with init


[7/13/2023 5:27 PM] dobamuffin
That the bootloader and other loaders?


[7/13/2023 5:28 PM] szybet
it manages filesystems, starts open rc, checks for security things, unpacks things, manages progress bar


[7/13/2023 5:28 PM] szybet
the code it questionable in some places


[7/13/2023 5:29 PM] dobamuffin
I think that would be a good start for me


[7/13/2023 5:30 PM] szybet
if you know c, yep

[7/13/2023 5:40 PM] dobamuffin
What other files rely on init?


[7/13/2023 5:41 PM] szybet
to compile, thats it?>


[7/13/2023 5:41 PM] dobamuffin
yeah


[7/13/2023 5:41 PM] dobamuffin
Oh ok.


[7/13/2023 5:41 PM] dobamuffin
Just a lot of functions in the .h file


[7/13/2023 5:41 PM] szybet
yep


[7/13/2023 5:42 PM] dobamuffin
I figured they must be getting called from other c functions too


[7/13/2023 5:42 PM] dobamuffin
but if they are not, then I have a starting point for what to edit


[7/13/2023 5:44 PM] szybet
its possible, im not sure, im not the authout


[7/13/2023 5:44 PM] dobamuffin
ok.


[7/13/2023 5:44 PM] dobamuffin
@tux-linux is the init.h header used anywhere else in the codebase?


[7/13/2023 5:49 PM] szybet
for 99% no


[7/13/2023 5:49 PM] szybet
so dont mind it


[7/13/2023 5:55 PM] dobamuffin
I was more worried about if I split the init into several files, then I need to modify the headers accordingly


[7/13/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
its the only c program in use


[7/13/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
propably


[7/13/2023 5:56 PM] szybet
so no worries really


[7/13/2023 5:56 PM] dobamuffin
ok


[7/13/2023 6:20 PM] tux_linux
c magic is fine...


[7/13/2023 6:20 PM] tux_linux

[7/13/2023 6:21 PM] tux_linux
why


[7/13/2023 6:22 PM] szybet
nah, let him start with init


[7/13/2023 6:22 PM] szybet
he already begun


[7/13/2023 6:22 PM] tux_linux
what will he do


[7/13/2023 6:22 PM] tux_linux
he just forked it


[7/13/2023 6:22 PM] tux_linux
do note that on github, I would estimate that 75% of forks never get a new commit hehe


[7/13/2023 6:23 PM] tux_linux
not to stop anything, but i think init is fine
it's using magic, but it works
so if it ain't broke, don't fix it


[7/13/2023 6:24 PM] szybet
but improve it :D


[7/13/2023 6:24 PM] szybet
split into files i think


[7/13/2023 6:24 PM] dobamuffin
My whole idea is to split the files in 2 so that there is a helper file, and the main init code in a different file.


[7/13/2023 6:25 PM] tux_linux
functions in helper file?


[7/13/2023 6:25 PM] dobamuffin
yeah


[7/13/2023 6:25 PM] dobamuffin
A lot of simple functions can be separated from the init code

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/13/2023 6:25 PM] szybet
good idea


[7/13/2023 6:26 PM] szybet
buit maybe look into power daemon code - its split based on functionality


[7/13/2023 6:26 PM] dobamuffin
yeah I can look into that too


[7/13/2023 6:58 PM] dobamuffin
Which library is that?


[7/13/2023 6:59 PM] szybet
fbink

cool, let us know if you need help


[7/15/2023 6:59 PM] kuratius
one of the most common models people have been buying recently is the Nia, but there is a chance you will get a hardware revision that isn't supported yet. It is also the weakest model, so something else may run better/faster


[7/15/2023 6:59 PM] kuratius
I think there is a clara model that is also either already supported or will be soon, cant remember the details


[7/15/2023 6:59 PM] tux_linux
glo **hd** is currently a fairly good option


[7/15/2023 6:59 PM] tux_linux
clara hd is in the porting process


[7/15/2023 6:59 PM] tux_linux
I am doing it myself


[7/15/2023 7:03 PM] saaancho
How hard is it to port new models to the existing base OS ?


[7/15/2023 7:06 PM] tux_linux
Hard


[7/15/2023 7:25 PM] szybet
Its the cheapest and newest hehe but yes


[7/15/2023 7:26 PM] szybet (pinned)
Hard? Maybe, impossible? Maybe, but easy? Maybe too? Time consuming so most people give up? Certainly


[7/15/2023 7:26 PM] tux_linux
you summed it up


[7/15/2023 7:26 PM] tux_linux
Pinned a message.


[7/15/2023 7:27 PM] szybet
Yep


[7/15/2023 7:31 PM] saaancho
Is there a guide on porting devices somewhere? And more generally, what does porting a device involve in terms of tasks/skills and material/software?


[7/15/2023 7:32 PM] szybet
Guide, well there are some partial ones


[7/15/2023 7:32 PM] szybet
The most knowledge is in porting threads


[7/15/2023 7:32 PM] szybet
Long lectures


[7/15/2023 7:33 PM] szybet
Well usb uart is needed for sure, dissasembling the device too


[7/15/2023 7:33 PM] szybet
As for skills, you can learn on the way, like nothing is impossible you can learn everything but programming, linux background and maybe a bit of electronic knowledgr can help


[7/15/2023 7:37 PM] szybet
The project was started, and contributed by people that didnt knowed almost anything at the start, maybe basics

There were magicians with big knowledge that helped a bit, but still you got the point on that

[7/16/2023 1:27 PM] szybet
It can be done, you would need to develop it

So in short, possible but nope


[7/16/2023 1:56 PM] tux_linux
It already exists
For emmc models


[7/16/2023 1:56 PM] tux_linux
Better just swap your SD card


[7/16/2023 7:45 PM] qiwulun
i have a clara 2e so i'm ineligible but im fascinated how this stuff works


[7/16/2023 7:46 PM] szybet
we made the kobo niaC* model kernel to work on nickel, clara 2e uses the same kernel so its 50% done already

~~there is something wrong with people, they start porting and give up in the middle of the task~~ No one ported it yet, it maybe has an eemc which can make it harder

InkBox OS user app: ITerm (sff) demo
ITerm or InkBox Terminal (originally sff), is a Qt-native app using libvterm for interacting with a tty, allowing an user to run shell commands on their device without the need of launching an X11 app which usually takes more time.

ITerm was ported from @jsbronder's sff and its source code is available there: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/sff

I have considered it, whats holding me back is that this is my only ereader and I don't want to fuck it trying to pry it open getting the sd card out. Not that i have seen inside but I would be expecting the pcb to be conformally coated to get that ipx8 rating, I actually don't want to lose my waterproofing just yet. If I had an old one hanging around I'd probably be more into the idea.


[7/19/2023 2:48 AM] tux_linux

This might be a bit silly of me to ask but, whats involved in porting it over? Just the kernel would be different?

I got a couple for the glo tho, is it worth going for the nia for ~2x the price? What is better in the newer model?


[7/20/2023 4:42 PM] szybet
its worth if its half the price


[7/20/2023 4:42 PM] szybet
clara maybe


[7/20/2023 4:42 PM] szybet
its not ported tho


[7/20/2023 4:44 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Only thing I found out about the nia is that it has a better procesor and more storage but this seems insignificant considering it has an sd slot, anything else?


[7/20/2023 4:44 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
I meant like the difference between nia and glo


[7/20/2023 4:45 PM] szybet
idk really, not much


[7/20/2023 4:46 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
The glo also has an sd internally?


[7/20/2023 4:46 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
or is it emmc


[7/20/2023 4:47 PM] szybet
sd card


[7/20/2023 4:52 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Hmm it's so weird how in so many years almost nothing has changed


[7/20/2023 4:52 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Will get the glo then


[7/20/2023 4:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
because of monopoly and its a simple device

but the eink technologi is diffrent a bit


[7/20/2023 4:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also im not sure about glo being compatibvle


[7/20/2023 4:55 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
compatible with inkbox?


[7/20/2023 4:55 PM] szybet
yep


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh, why's that?


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
the processor too old?


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] szybet
there are 2 hglos


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] szybet
the hd one is ported


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] szybet
the other one not sure


[7/20/2023 4:56 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
ah


[7/20/2023 4:57 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
on the site it says both


[7/20/2023 4:57 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
are supported


[7/20/2023 4:57 PM] szybet
well then both


[7/20/2023 4:57 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[7/20/2023 4:57 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
which one have you got? the nia?


[7/20/2023 4:58 PM] szybet
i ported the nia


[7/20/2023 4:58 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
ah, and tux-linux?


[7/20/2023 4:58 PM] [matrix] Szybet
he has every other device supported


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh damn that's a lot


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] matty123458687
Whats his daily driver tho


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
a book device


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
loool


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i mean the android ones


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
this is so funny


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and sad


[7/20/2023 4:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and funny


[7/20/2023 5:01 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i daily drive the nia even in school for note taking, with a keyboard


[7/20/2023 5:14 PM] tux_linux
glo hd is better


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
boox


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
mainly because of the screen size


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
i don't read


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
:/


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
👀


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
i use it for reading music partitions or taking notes at school


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
mainly


[7/20/2023 5:15 PM] tux_linux
well, when I read, I have a really interesting book


[7/20/2023 5:16 PM] tux_linux
and it happens what, once in two years?


[7/20/2023 5:16 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh interesting, I thought you developed this mailny as a book reader software


[7/20/2023 5:16 PM] tux_linux
well, i do


[7/20/2023 5:16 PM] tux_linux
my boox device doesn't run inkbox


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] tux_linux
i don't have plans to hack it


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
at all?


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] tux_linux
it maybe is better left like that


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] tux_linux
- it's android
- no kernel sources available, chinese company
- no developer community at all


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you developed an ereader os and you dont read


[7/20/2023 5:17 PM] tux_linux
for the second point i guess i could push a bit and try to tackle it but i have other things to do


[7/20/2023 5:18 PM] tux_linux
yes, how can i have time to read if im doing this


[7/20/2023 5:18 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
lmao


[7/20/2023 5:19 PM] tux_linux
as i said, i only really read when the book is really interesting
and that very rarely happens
so tldr i pretty much don't read, even if sometimes there are exceptions


[7/20/2023 5:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
on the other point its not like we focus on reading with inkbox


[7/20/2023 5:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
all those apps


[7/20/2023 5:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
lol


[7/20/2023 5:23 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I don't read much either, I've used to, trying to come back to it


[7/20/2023 5:25 PM] tux_linux
well
so you both are hypocrites
hehe


[7/20/2023 5:25 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
First gotta get myself an open source ereader with custom software, this will surely help :)))


[7/20/2023 5:25 PM] tux_linux
good


[7/20/2023 5:25 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I am interested in using it for different purpouses too tho


[7/20/2023 5:26 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
A device with such a long battery life and with a system where you have so much control you can take everywhere


[7/20/2023 5:27 PM] tux_linux
bear in mind: it's not a desktop pc
it *will* be slow


[7/20/2023 5:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
dont expect super battery life with wifi


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
you dont need wifi for note taking for example


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yep


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] tux_linux
you need otg keyboard that sucks power


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
but matrix client, rss client


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] tux_linux
so, it's a tie


[7/20/2023 5:28 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
nope hehe


[7/20/2023 5:29 PM] tux_linux
?


[7/20/2023 5:29 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
how long does it last for you?


[7/20/2023 5:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
kobos need external power, they need to be charged to make usb host to work


[7/20/2023 5:30 PM] matty123458687
Is it possible to use a powered usb hub? Maybe on one of those portable usb chargers it would last longer


[7/20/2023 5:30 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so you use a external power source: power bank


[7/20/2023 5:30 PM] tux_linux
well, yea, but still, kinda defeats the point of long battery life


[7/20/2023 5:30 PM] [matrix] Szybet
or my abomination: hot swappable batteries with a custom circuit on the back of the ereader


[7/20/2023 5:30 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
listen to me when it gets to usb


[7/20/2023 5:31 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
i dont complain, idk
as i said, i use external hot swapable batteries


[7/20/2023 5:31 PM] matterbridge#2154

yea


[7/20/2023 5:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet
this is the reason i jopined this project


[7/20/2023 5:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i had this vision


[7/20/2023 5:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ereader device with jack audio


[7/20/2023 5:34 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and mouse / keyboard was a side project


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] matty123458687
How long has this been in the works?


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] tux_linux
the project?


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] tux_linux
2.5y


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i completed ita few weeks ago


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] tux_linux
started in feb. 2021


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] matty123458687
I meant his abomination


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
over a year


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] tux_linux
ok


[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i needed to help with inkbox because it was horrible for me


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so it took longer


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also electrical engineering is hard when you are stupid


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
insane dedication


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] matty123458687
Indeed it can be a challenge


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
took me 2 months to figure out it


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] tux_linux
i think we are both insane


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] tux_linux
first szybet is insane for having stayed in the project for more than one year
and i am insane for having started it and having maintained it for this long


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
i also ported the nia, learned qt cpp for that


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
yep


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
idk if you registered but i will stop such active contribution starting this school year


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] matty123458687
Idk i think its pretty cool. Sanity is overrated


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] tux_linux
well, you told me you wouldn't have much time


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also i hope inkbox will be completed at this time


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
minimal what i expect from it


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] tux_linux
how can it be completed


[7/20/2023 5:39 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
Knew it, Szybet jesteś z polski


[7/20/2023 5:39 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Your name sounded very polish


[7/20/2023 5:39 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
my theory got confirmed when you linked a polish store for your keyboard


[7/20/2023 5:39 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
proper reader and settings, a bit redesigned apps and code and thats it


[7/20/2023 5:40 PM] matterbridge#2154

Noo sz

[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
nooooo z niemiec jestem ale od 6 lat w polsce mieszkam


[7/20/2023 5:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
a no spoko


[7/20/2023 5:49 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
it's not quite clear to me, how is the keyboard connected?


[7/20/2023 5:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
custom connector made out of magnets and gold pins, there a usb connection goes to the top and connects to the usbhub


[7/20/2023 5:50 PM] [matrix] Szybet
its not the best, but its detachable and its working so its fine


[7/20/2023 5:52 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I'm interested in a small device that can be used as a terminal for servers/note taking with vim, this could propably be done, but the keyboard is quite large, maybe making it foldable would be an option


[7/20/2023 5:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
could be used for that

this keyboard is the smallest / cheapest i could find


[7/20/2023 5:52 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and reasonable working, the cheap "tablet" ones are horrible


[7/20/2023 5:53 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also, how foldable keyboard???

its bluettoth


[7/20/2023 5:53 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
that one doesn't look that good tho, I've seen better ones


[7/20/2023 5:54 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you could in theory connect an usb adapter to make bluettoth work + drivers


[7/20/2023 5:54 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
but surely there are some 2.4ghz


[7/20/2023 5:54 PM] [matrix] Szybet
but i wont charge a keyboard, never


[7/20/2023 5:54 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i refuse to create new problems


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
thats better, but i had problems with mouses 2.4 on kobo


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it could work, but maybe not, maybe im missing something


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
also, price...


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yeaa


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i could get 6 platinet keyboards


[7/20/2023 5:55 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
that's not that cheap


[7/20/2023 5:56 PM] [matrix] Szybet
for 300 zl i would make my own keyboard and 3d print a case

[7/20/2023 5:57 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
problem is they are thicc


[7/20/2023 5:57 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
my ideal device would fit in my pocket


[7/20/2023 5:57 PM] [matrix] Szybet
my setus uses the keyboard as a base for the ereader to stand


[7/20/2023 5:57 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i added a half kg steel bar to the bottom so it would be stable


[7/20/2023 5:57 PM] [matrix] Szybet
lol


[7/20/2023 5:58 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Until now I have experimented with my phone for a portable development device, but they keyboard is the biggest problem


[7/20/2023 5:58 PM] [matrix] Szybet
idk how its solved on ereaders?


[7/20/2023 5:58 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
yeah that's not going into the pocket lol


[7/20/2023 5:58 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
wdym


[7/20/2023 5:59 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
ereaders just don't have a keyboard same as phones, this is the biggest problem with mobile devices imo


[7/20/2023 5:59 PM] matty123458687
You mean the on screen kb?


[7/20/2023 5:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you could make a software one


[7/20/2023 5:59 PM] [matrix] Szybet
we have them, the ones in sanki, nachat are good


[7/20/2023 6:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
in inkbox not so much


[7/20/2023 6:00 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
yeah ofc but that's not really usable


[7/20/2023 6:00 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
that's my problem


[7/20/2023 6:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[7/20/2023 6:00 PM] tux_linux
excuse me


[7/20/2023 6:01 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it flickers, doesnt have a cursor, is on the center of the screen, and its small


[7/20/2023 6:01 PM] tux_linux
iterm??


[7/20/2023 6:01 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i didnt say iterm

tux-linux do you use the glo (not hd) sometimes? is it good?


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
he mostly uses it for developing inkbox i think


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] tux_linux
yes, it's fine
a bit slow


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] tux_linux
but usable


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] tux_linux
awful screen tho


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] tux_linux
well, the one i have


[7/20/2023 6:15 PM] tux_linux
even a kobo touch's screen is better in terms of darkness in comparison


[7/20/2023 7:13 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I assume it should be fine tho processor wise, it ran android, 2.3.4 to be fair but still, inkbox seems very optimized so it should be not that bad


[7/20/2023 7:58 PM] szybet
its not


[7/20/2023 7:59 PM] szybet
but its the best open source ereader os

it focuses on reading and its better at it

I'm considering buying a kobo ereader


[7/21/2023 3:18 PM] kezhelan
where I can install the custom os


[7/21/2023 3:18 PM] kezhelan
which one would be the most recent that you could advise


[7/21/2023 3:19 PM] tux_linux
the glo hd is your best bet


[7/21/2023 3:19 PM] tux_linux
clara hd is in porting process


[7/21/2023 3:19 PM] tux_linux
or you can also go for the Aura SE n236, it's not too bad


[7/21/2023 3:20 PM] kezhelan
n437?


[7/21/2023 3:20 PM] tux_linux
yes, glo hd n437


[7/21/2023 3:20 PM] kezhelan
nice do they have the front yellow light ?


[7/21/2023 3:21 PM] tux_linux
no

Judge by yourself


[7/21/2023 3:25 PM] tux_linux
tl;dr
It is pretty far but I can't currently guarantee that basic things like having a decent eInk display update mode will work


[7/21/2023 3:25 PM] kezhelan
Yes I was reading your latest posts


[7/21/2023 3:25 PM] kezhelan
Keep up the good work


[7/21/2023 3:25 PM] kezhelan
Kobo's kernel is open source right


[7/21/2023 3:25 PM] kezhelan
that's why there is not so much hacking to be done ?


[7/21/2023 3:27 PM] tux_linux
there is a lot of hacking to be done even if the kernel is open sourced
as a matter of fact, this kernel is stuck at an old Linux version and never updated
Clara HD uses a 5.16 kernel which has been upstreamed with rewritten device drivers, it has been done by @andi  and some others


[7/21/2023 3:27 PM] kezhelan
ah ok 🙂


[7/21/2023 3:27 PM] kezhelan
Thanks for making this project

[7/21/2023 3:29 PM] tux_linux
so the glo hd is the best option, you could also go for the nia but it has less RAM and the new variant (C) isn't currently compatible, so you have to look for the right one (A)
@Szybet can give you more details on it


[7/21/2023 3:30 PM] kezhelan
Yes, it seemed like it was hard to see which nia was which without opening them up


[7/21/2023 3:30 PM] tux_linux
yea


[7/21/2023 3:30 PM] kezhelan
And why are some firmware on the website available only if asked


[7/21/2023 3:30 PM] kezhelan
?


[7/21/2023 3:31 PM] kezhelan
only per request?


[7/21/2023 3:31 PM] tux_linux
i didn't take time to make images, or it's too dangerous for the average user to install, or both


[7/21/2023 3:31 PM] kezhelan
ok

[7/23/2023 4:40 PM] szybet
it is supposed to be like that

you can increase the size eassly, its described on the wiki

Would it be reasonable to start the inkbox disk images at set SD card sizes like 16gb and 32gb, then any size beyond that provide documentation?


[7/23/2023 5:35 PM] rush.one
To make it easier, as Windows users require 3rd party software to manage the partition tables.


[7/23/2023 5:35 PM] szybet
currently its a bad implementation - it could be done that the ereader resizes the partition to the max


[7/23/2023 5:36 PM] szybet
available, without user interaction


[7/23/2023 5:36 PM] rush.one
Ah I see, like at first boot?


[7/23/2023 5:36 PM] szybet
if the project survives, then sure this could be made

yep, exactly

Are there any special steps to get the OS to recognize the changed size of the onboard file?

I was looking at FOSS e-book readers, because my nook simple touch is dissolving. And I could only find koreader or inkbox, and from the looks of the code, liked inkbox more 🙂

We are not trying to convince you not to use InkBox, we are just surprised by the way you see the project


[7/26/2023 5:09 PM] raven34983
I dunno, comparing with Koreader, koreader seems bloated for the features it provides


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] raven34983
plus, I prefer substituting the OS, I don't see much the point of only providing a new UI


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] tux_linux
you have an unpopular way of seeing things


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] tux_linux
that's good


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] raven34983
xD


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] raven34983
plus, looking around inkbox, I see Rust and other things, which is nice


[7/26/2023 5:10 PM] szybet
~~And the new UI will refuse to launch every month because of main UI system updates, or just happy accidents~~


[7/26/2023 5:11 PM] raven34983
Lua is ok, but I just want a minimal UI in an OS. Don't need wifi or so


[7/26/2023 5:11 PM] tux_linux
we provide wifi but well


[7/26/2023 5:11 PM] szybet
~~And its so bloated it had a memory leak which made it unusable after a while~~


[7/26/2023 5:11 PM] raven34983
then add how the org looks on github, how you have a matrix space, etc etc


[7/26/2023 5:11 PM] raven34983
I can see the craftmanship difference between the 2 projects, even if all that is circumstantial


[7/26/2023 5:12 PM] szybet
there has been a crusade to replace python with rust because it was slow and python is bad after all


[7/26/2023 5:13 PM] szybet
we use wifi for more stuff: apps: RSS reader, matrix client, syncthing...


[7/26/2023 5:13 PM] szybet
optional and modular


[7/26/2023 5:14 PM] raven34983
I haven't look muched at it tbf. Could see myself using syncthing or the Rss reader


[7/26/2023 5:15 PM] raven34983
this is going to be the usual silly question, but which Kobo would be the more recommended and somewhat featureful for inkbox?


[7/26/2023 5:17 PM] tux_linux
glo hd n437

something like that would do


[7/26/2023 8:13 PM] szybet
or just using usb


[7/26/2023 8:13 PM] szybet
but for that wait for tux-linux


[7/26/2023 8:16 PM] tux_linux
You can do it with nc
Or g_mass_storage from an initrd


[7/26/2023 8:17 PM] szybet
explain further to him that idea


[7/26/2023 8:20 PM] Deleted User
so i either need kernel/initrd with g_mass_storage to use it as a usb storage device, or i could copy it over ssh/nc


[7/26/2023 8:20 PM] Deleted User
im going to try with ssh/nc


[7/26/2023 8:20 PM] szybet
it propably already has those modules


[7/26/2023 8:20 PM] tux_linux
nc is probably the simplest


[7/26/2023 8:20 PM] tux_linux
It needs to be in an initrd


[7/26/2023 8:21 PM] tux_linux
Without using mmc

i.e. without nickel running

I keep my notes on InkBox in Hedgedoc, a collaborative markdown editor. Please feel free to add some of your notes as well. Maybe we can co-create some sort of user documentation in this way... See https://md.giplt.nl/5ogdx1ljSeqxE6GY-21CqQ

Thanks, it's a great start


[7/27/2023 10:19 PM] tux_linux
You can also take screenshots from your device into a PNG file


[7/27/2023 10:19 PM] tux_linux
Is it rooted?


[7/27/2023 10:19 PM] szybet
awesome


[7/27/2023 10:50 PM] [matrix] Harmen
No it's not rooted AFAIK, I still have a lot to figure out.


[7/27/2023 10:50 PM] [matrix] Harmen
Also on my device (Kobo Mini) I can't seem to install User apps or KoBox extensions. But first let's document what *does* work...


[7/27/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
you are the second person reporting this


[7/27/2023 10:52 PM] tux_linux
I will look into it


[7/27/2023 11:27 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
Harmen: what's your issue? I can install them perfectly fine on my Glo


[7/27/2023 11:27 PM] szybet
glo is not the mini ytou know


[7/27/2023 11:28 PM] [matrix] tux-linux
almost


[7/28/2023 12:00 AM] [matrix] Harmen
When I copy the *.isa and *.isa.dgst for extensions into the KoBox-EXT drve and unplug the USB cable the KoBox menu is gone from the apps index. Similar when I copy User Apps into the .apps folder the User Apps menu disappears.


[7/28/2023 12:00 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet


[7/28/2023 12:00 AM] tux_linux
strange, because none of that happened here


[7/28/2023 12:03 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Most of the time unplugging USB gets InkBox into some unresponsive state. Only power cycling brings it back. But the the apps menu is somehow damaged. When I remove the .isa file again it doesn't come back.


[7/28/2023 12:03 AM] tux_linux
it happens depending on the device
usually plug/unplug again should make it unfreeze


[7/28/2023 12:04 AM] szybet
Without logs, shell we can only speculate


[7/28/2023 12:04 AM] [matrix] Harmen
I have not figured out yet how to monitor what's going on. Does InkBox send system messages to the onboard UART connector? I could then hook that up and see what goes on.


[7/28/2023 12:05 AM] tux_linux
ssh via wifi or usb


[7/28/2023 12:05 AM] tux_linux
you need to root it


[7/28/2023 12:05 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Ok, will try that over the weekend and report back.

[7/28/2023 12:09 AM] [matrix] Harmen
I also recall another issue when unplugging the USB cable *did* bring the device back to life but somehow without refreshing the eink display. I found out by clicking the screen at random places in hope to hit a button, and sometimes that brought up a book, the home screen or whatever I seemed to have hit.


[7/28/2023 12:09 AM] tux_linux
strange


[7/28/2023 12:10 AM] [matrix] Harmen
What logs should I look for?


[7/28/2023 12:10 AM] tux_linux
when you will be rooted
connect to wifi
```
echo true > /boot/flags/GUI_DEBUG
restart inkbox_gui
```
and copy-paste the output


[7/28/2023 12:11 AM] tux_linux
to root it you need to access diagnostics partition
slide the power button a few times at boot and wait


[7/28/2023 12:11 AM] tux_linux
then you do reset as root


[7/28/2023 12:14 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Ha, that goes straight into the manual :-)

I just encountered a weird problem. When booting from a fresh InkBox 2.0 image my Kobo Mini crashes with error code 2 in stead of launching the first-boot-configuration-sequence. Error code 2 refers to an invalid signature for the root fs. However I doubled checked the image checksum and that matches perfectly. What could be going on?


[7/29/2023 8:07 PM] tux_linux
Probably an error during flashing


[7/29/2023 8:07 PM] tux_linux
Or SD card issue


[7/29/2023 8:07 PM] tux_linux
Try to reflash it and be sure to sync writes to disk/eject it before putting it back into the reader

[7/29/2023 10:33 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
just am curious, how does it preserve the waveform data when flashing it? (using the command provided on the website


[7/29/2023 10:33 PM] szybet
it doesnt


[7/29/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
there are warnings about it, and a guide to reapply the original one


[7/29/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
for 99.9% it doesnt matter


[7/29/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
the screen will work fine


[7/29/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
but it can be damaged if luck is not with you


[7/29/2023 10:34 PM] szybet
in the future if it will ever exist, inkbox installer will replace it :D


[7/29/2023 10:35 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh, as in the screen can be damaged?


[7/29/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
yep


[7/29/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
eink calibration stuff


[7/29/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
didnt happened ever to inkbox users


[7/29/2023 10:35 PM] szybet
only once when nicolas applied a completly wrong waveform, then it made a mess


[7/29/2023 10:38 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
and its irrecoverable?


[7/29/2023 10:38 PM] szybet
the damage he has done, yes


[7/29/2023 10:38 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
how did it manifest?


[7/29/2023 10:38 PM] szybet
this example was like that


[7/29/2023 10:38 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but gotta say awesome ootb experience


[7/29/2023 10:39 PM] szybet
very bad contrast, refreshes leaving a lot of ghosting


[7/29/2023 10:39 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
ah, not that bad, at least usable


[7/29/2023 10:39 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but damn it would be good to put out a warning for that


[7/29/2023 10:40 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
also copied the original sd onto the new one for nothing


[7/29/2023 10:40 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡

just like android custom roms


[7/29/2023 10:46 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I would include some mentioning about this waveform data before the installation, ideally on how to copy the data because that's propably the best way

like apart from that waveform data this is basically safe


[7/29/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
nope, still risk. You cant be sure of everything


[7/29/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
its there


[7/29/2023 10:48 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea true i guess


[7/29/2023 10:48 PM] szybet
also as for copying, it more complicated but basically here: https://github.com/Szybet/eink-waveforms

but isn't it better to by default have ppl clone the waveform data? seems like good practice


[7/29/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
writing the wrong image can in theory start a fire from the battery / release magic smoke

you need linux for that, so not easy

im not sure, propably it isint


[7/29/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
it never happened, but from electronical stand point, in theory very unlikely but yes

ah okay I see, the firmware extractor is an universal way


[7/29/2023 10:52 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
well that's true that complicates the install process a bit, if there would be a graphical installer for non techy ppl to install it too this would be a good feature to add


[7/29/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but now I understand why it's not there

[7/29/2023 11:20 PM] tux_linux
yeah, it was blocking initially
szybet made it non-blocking

I am excited about how the book sleeping screen will look, downloading some books rn


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] tux_linux
its not that simple


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] szybet
you will be dissapointed


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] szybet
not added yet


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh :(


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] tux_linux
you *can* set custom screensavers


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
maybe something for me to add


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] tux_linux
yes


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] szybet
yep


[7/29/2023 11:22 PM] tux_linux
if you want
it will prob. not be easy


[7/29/2023 11:23 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yeea I see the difficulty where on sleep it has to communicate with inkbox, not sure how sleep is exactly handled rn but propably much simpler


[7/29/2023 11:24 PM] tux_linux
if you want to live the nightmare:
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox-power-daemon/blob/main/src/prepareSleep.cpp
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox-power-daemon/blob/main/src/goingSleep.cpp
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox-power-daemon/blob/main/src/afterSleep.cpp


[7/29/2023 11:24 PM] szybet
nah, not be a nightmare either


[7/29/2023 11:24 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
and also making a nice api/interface/metadata thing about the current screen so it can react accordingly to different screens if sb wants to add a sleep screen for their calculator app for example


[7/29/2023 11:25 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
thank you will look into it


[7/29/2023 11:26 PM] szybet
the watchdog is the real nightmare


[7/29/2023 11:26 PM] szybet
hehe


[7/29/2023 11:29 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Okay so I'd add a new lockscreenBackgroundMode = "contextual" and copy the logic a bit from the screensaver and make the image generated instead of staticly taken from something so that's not that problematic just have to get the context somehow


[7/29/2023 11:30 PM] szybet
you can eassly gather some data from inkbox while its reading a book


[7/29/2023 11:30 PM] szybet
like the thumbnail


[7/29/2023 11:31 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡

[7/29/2023 11:35 PM] szybet
without a doubt


[7/29/2023 11:59 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Harmen 
Ok this had nothing to do with InkBox. Not a corrupted SD card either but dd giving the impression of writing an image to the SD card but not doing anything at all in reaity. Laptop reboot was the solution 😦


[7/30/2023 12:01 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Maybe a laptop having lost touch with reality explains another problem I reported here before as well. In any case, I now can install User apps.


[7/30/2023 12:02 AM] szybet
it could


[7/30/2023 12:02 AM] szybet
user apps work diffrent than xorg ones, but yes


[7/30/2023 12:04 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Yup, will test KoBox apps tomorrow


[7/30/2023 12:09 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
how long does it usually take to open a book?


[7/30/2023 12:09 AM] szybet
it depends on the book size


[7/30/2023 12:09 AM] szybet
but a looong time :(


[7/30/2023 12:09 AM] szybet
for ebooks, im already working on a almost complete rewrite


[7/30/2023 12:09 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
got a book with 0.7MB


[7/30/2023 12:10 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
awesome


[7/30/2023 12:10 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
screen flashed a couple of times then tried sleeping waking it up and getting a blank screen now


[7/30/2023 12:10 AM] szybet
oh also for start, you need to calibrate the size of the page, font size too: the defaults are bad for some reason?

I will also fix that, but for now you need to calibrate it


[7/30/2023 12:11 AM] szybet
going to sleep is a bad idea


[7/30/2023 12:11 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea seems like that might cause some problems


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] szybet
wait a bit, if nothing happens push the power button, then pause push it more it will reset


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] szybet
the device


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] szybet
then try one more time, but wait a lot more


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea I am trying to force shut it down


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
held it for about 10s or more


[7/30/2023 12:12 AM] szybet
look at the diode


[7/30/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
push it, then pause, then push it


[7/30/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
the button


[7/30/2023 12:13 AM] szybet
the diode turning on means its turning on the device


[7/30/2023 12:13 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
sleeping is reacting but I can't get it to turn off


[7/30/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
push the button for more time


[7/30/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
hold it


[7/30/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
not spam it


[7/30/2023 12:14 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea no I hold it for 30s and it does not turn off


[7/30/2023 12:14 AM] szybet
make sure its not sleeping?


[7/30/2023 12:15 AM] szybet
also after those 30 seconds, push it not for that long so it can turn on


[7/30/2023 12:15 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
tried sleeping not sleeping everthing


[7/30/2023 12:15 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
yeah ik but it doesnt turn off


[7/30/2023 12:15 AM] szybet
are there more button on the glo?


[7/30/2023 12:15 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
it just switches the sleeping state


[7/30/2023 12:16 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
yea a backlight button


[7/30/2023 12:16 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
tried holding both


[7/30/2023 12:16 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Harmen 
I had this too and the device turned out to be awake. If you tap the screen somewhat at random and be lucky enhough to hit some widget you will see the screen responding again. Apparently sometimes the display doesn't refresh when coming out of sleep state...


[7/30/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
hold the power button?...


[7/30/2023 12:16 AM] szybet
um listen, this reboot / power off things is hardware handled, inkbox cant interfere with it


[7/30/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
so it must work


[7/30/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
there is no "no"...


[7/30/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
try some more time, mayeb wait for @tux-linux ?


[7/30/2023 12:17 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ 
yea I assume it works like that thats why I am confused af


[7/30/2023 12:17 AM] szybet
on the nia the process is really straight


[7/30/2023 12:18 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
there is a reset hole


[7/30/2023 12:18 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
in the glo


[7/30/2023 12:18 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
will try that


[7/30/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
oh


[7/30/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
yea


[7/30/2023 12:19 AM] szybet
it could explain a bit


[7/30/2023 12:19 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh yea that worked


[7/30/2023 12:20 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
and I was wondering like wtf is this hole is it a mic or what


[7/30/2023 12:20 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
turns out its a reset button


[7/30/2023 12:20 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
why didn't they just make it a hardware 10s reset


[7/30/2023 12:20 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
maybe used too much time at that time


[7/30/2023 12:20 AM] szybet
its kobos fault, very confusing


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
well


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
not that confusing


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
if there is a reset hole but useless


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] szybet
on some models people are instead sticking wood sticks into the led and damaging it because they think its a reset button instead


[7/30/2023 12:21 AM] [matrix] Harmen
Same here for Kobo Mini. When stuck I use the reset hole to trigger a hard reboot.


[7/30/2023 12:22 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
aaand again battery critical


[7/30/2023 12:22 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I've seen the battery indicator jump around earlier


[7/30/2023 12:23 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
idk if it's inkbox or the battery in this thing is fried


[7/30/2023 12:23 AM] szybet
hmm its and used old ereader


[7/30/2023 12:23 AM] szybet
maybe the battery neads to be replaced


[7/30/2023 12:23 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I'd say it's inkbox because the guy who sold it to me said he was using it normally before and it seemed to not have any problems


[7/30/2023 12:23 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but idk tbh


[7/30/2023 12:25 AM] szybet
how much did it drop


[7/30/2023 12:25 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
when I got it it had about 50%(visual indicator so idk exactly) on the main system, when I started inkbox it was down to 19%


[7/30/2023 12:25 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I need to charge it to 100% then see to have accurate info


[7/30/2023 12:26 AM] szybet
the visual indicator could show 31 for example and still be on half


[7/30/2023 12:27 AM] szybet
we defenitely will have a bit worse battery life, a bit


[7/30/2023 12:27 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
yea true


[7/30/2023 12:27 AM] szybet
because of some hacks the main firmware does


[7/30/2023 12:28 AM] szybet
on the other hand, the device with inkbox might charge faster because we dont fake sleeping while charging on devices where hardware allows it


[7/30/2023 12:28 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
The boot times are horrendous tho gotta say


[7/30/2023 12:28 AM] szybet
could be implemented maybe - but propably the kernels from the manufacturer limti us


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] szybet
we preload everything at start so it wont take time later - we have more stuff, like apps, xorg


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] szybet
xorg is like 40% of the boot time so yea


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] szybet
turn it off, visible diffrence


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
ohh okay just disabled that


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
so that's good to know


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I don't need that xorg


[7/30/2023 12:29 AM] szybet
also system design needs that but its worth it


[7/30/2023 12:30 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
I prefer wayland :)


[7/30/2023 12:30 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
jk


[7/30/2023 12:30 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
OH WOW boot times improved drasitcally


[7/30/2023 12:30 AM] szybet
like i migrated my custom inkbox install, and all user data by copying a few files from an old sd card - i didnt needed to play arroudn with partitions

also the update process is simple


[7/30/2023 12:30 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡

[7/30/2023 12:32 AM] szybet
which is hard


[7/30/2023 12:32 AM] szybet
because i think hacking nicolas would be hard

Can I take screenshots on inkbox?


[7/30/2023 12:42 AM] tux_linux
you need to root the device

then you can ssh to it and `fbgrab screen.png`


[7/30/2023 12:42 AM] szybet
just make a photo


[7/30/2023 12:43 AM] tux_linux

on inkbox


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] tux_linux
i am on m2, so kinda stuck on it for a few months i think
i use UTM and an Arch aarch64 vm


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] szybet
you mean?


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] szybet
what formatting is missing


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] szybet
line tabs?


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
on callibre it is cursive and centered


[7/30/2023 12:50 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
on inkbox it is normal and in the top left


[7/30/2023 12:51 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
here Preface is in the middle with spacing and links to contents


[7/30/2023 12:52 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
so links missing too


[7/30/2023 12:52 AM] tux_linux
inkbox usually supports formatting like that


[7/30/2023 12:52 AM] tux_linux
at least regarding bold/italic/underline


[7/30/2023 12:53 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
hmm maybe my export settings are a problem


[7/30/2023 12:53 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
just downloaded calibre and set it to kobo glo

do i need to set something specific?


[7/30/2023 12:56 AM] tux_linux
we don't support calibre at all


[7/30/2023 12:56 AM] tux_linux
at least i've never used it with inkbox


[7/30/2023 12:56 AM] tux_linux
so idk?


[7/30/2023 12:57 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
oh, do you use something or just copy it over?


[7/30/2023 12:57 AM] tux_linux
i just copy my books in the usb storage


[7/30/2023 12:58 AM] tux_linux
well, i more often put them on the device via ssh/scp


[7/30/2023 1:01 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
well I think it just generates epub files or copies them over, mainly used it because I remember using it with my kindle a long time ago when I had it


[7/30/2023 1:01 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
because I used it for removing DRM and converting them to the MOBI format the kindle required


[7/30/2023 1:02 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but I downloaded an epub and put that on the device basically now

but I can modifiy it in some way to fit into screensizes, not sure what exactly that does but it basically processes the files, it outputs normall epub files tho so I am not sure what exactly the problem would be, I can send over the file if you want to check it out

the gold standard for me to develop things for inkbox via comparing to other software was okular

I'd say some good features for the new reader would be:
hiding the bar at the bottom, takes up screen real estate that could be used for the book
switching pages by tapping left/right, opening the menu with a press on the bottom for example
an option for a progress indicator at the bottom


[7/30/2023 1:19 AM] szybet
ye, planned


[7/30/2023 1:37 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
so when I enable USB mode then do nothing and remove the usb cable all is fine, when I transfer something then eject then remove usb cable it gets stuck on usb connected


[7/30/2023 1:40 AM] szybet
Connect the cable / disconnect it again

[7/30/2023 1:47 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
kinda weird


[7/30/2023 1:48 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
this was happening with encryption and without folders aswell


[7/30/2023 1:53 AM] tux_linux
if you plug/unplug two or three times does it work


[7/30/2023 1:53 AM] tux_linux
i will be improving this for next release


[7/30/2023 1:58 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
nope


[7/30/2023 1:59 AM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
after restart I plug it into the powerbank and make it connect and disconnect and then it rescans then the books are there


[7/30/2023 1:59 AM] tux_linux
and this happens only with encryption and without folders?


[7/30/2023 1:59 AM] tux_linux
strange


[7/30/2023 1:59 AM] tux_linux
can you try once again?

szybet should fix that hopefully


[7/30/2023 11:57 AM] szybet
this is the biggest issue i will address


[7/30/2023 1:16 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
The battery seems quite terrible, either the battery life or the battery indicator, it seems like it is taking the battery percentage directly from the voltage and when I charge it it has a higher voltage therefore it shows 100% but when I unplug it it shows 99% then 91% almost immediatly


[7/30/2023 1:17 PM] szybet
nope, thats not normal


[7/30/2023 1:18 PM] szybet
and not, its taking it from the pmic


[7/30/2023 1:18 PM] szybet
do you have wifi turned on?

[7/30/2023 9:26 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
so the battery is not dropping while idle so thats good


[7/30/2023 9:26 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
when loading a book it takes 2-4% off the battery immediatly


[7/30/2023 9:26 PM] szybet
idle means?


[7/30/2023 9:27 PM] szybet
maybe the battery doesnt like sudden power consumption, its old and prefers stable


[7/30/2023 9:27 PM] szybet
you can go to power settings and in experimental settigs set cpu governor to powersave which will limit the cpu


[7/30/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
and, finally: It's not normal on any ereader, hardware, software to make the battery drop 4% while the cpu runs at 100% for a while, 1%? 2? fine, but not that much


[7/30/2023 9:29 PM] szybet
in conclusion: battery needs to be replaced


[7/30/2023 9:29 PM] matterbridge#2154

left on a book then it going to sleep


[7/30/2023 9:30 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
even dropped 5%


[7/30/2023 9:30 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
when switching to another book to be exact


[7/30/2023 9:30 PM] szybet
you can propably grab a battery off botland, just look up dimensions and make sure its more but not less than the current capacity

and you will need to solder some cables to the new connector

or just grab an off the shelf battery for the glo somewhere else


[7/30/2023 9:30 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
then the loadtimes would go from over 15s to even longer


[7/30/2023 9:31 PM] szybet
welp yea


[7/30/2023 9:31 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but well book reading is kinda unusable without the autocalibration


[7/30/2023 9:32 PM] szybet
now you know why im working on a replecement

also, you can turn on scroll bars, so you will need to scroll for this uncutted content... yea its bad

not sure how there is communication with the bms, with 2 wires, is that a thing? or is the bms on the mainboard?


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] szybet
there is not


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] szybet
there is a protection circuit inside the battery and inside the pmic on the board


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] szybet
its fine if the battery wont get hot ( its an ereader )


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
so there is no bms


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] szybet
phones have a 3 pin because they get hot so the monitor the temperature


[7/30/2023 9:37 PM] szybet
bms? the pmic is the bms


[7/30/2023 9:38 PM] szybet
it charges the battery


[7/30/2023 9:38 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
ahh


[7/30/2023 9:38 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
and how does it report the capacity?


[7/30/2023 9:39 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
nvm 1500mAh are the replacements


[7/30/2023 9:39 PM] szybet
it doesnt

the one in mine is 1200 mAh but is reaaaly flat

andi explains it somewhere


[7/30/2023 9:39 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
so it goes off the voltage propably?


[7/30/2023 9:39 PM] szybet
you need to match the dimensions

and you need to solder


[7/30/2023 9:39 PM] szybet
and some algorithms based on current in short


[7/30/2023 9:40 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
yea so I think my suspicions could be confirmed with it showing a much higher percentage when being charged


[7/30/2023 9:41 PM] szybet
nope


[7/30/2023 9:41 PM] szybet
its really accurate, the percentage


[7/30/2023 9:41 PM] szybet
your battery is simply depleted at higher voltages ( so higher capacity levels) so it goes faster


[7/30/2023 9:42 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
it's 50x60x2


[7/30/2023 9:42 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
hard to find such a form factor


[7/30/2023 9:42 PM] matterbridge#2154

[7/30/2023 9:43 PM] szybet
its 2mm?

yeaa...


[7/30/2023 9:44 PM] szybet
yea this will be harder then


[7/30/2023 9:44 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡

[7/30/2023 9:44 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
but more then that no


[7/30/2023 9:44 PM] szybet
look up some specialised stores for those batteries


[7/30/2023 9:46 PM] szybet
maybe some phones used a similar sized


[7/30/2023 9:46 PM] szybet
or less sized


[7/30/2023 9:47 PM] szybet
well still, you should be fine below 50 zl for something like that

load times quite a lot better tho


[7/30/2023 10:39 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
Regarding the reader, instead of making a new solution, wouldn't it be better to maybe just use something existing open source?
like for example https://github.com/baskerville/plato (written in rust btw)

1. I tried it. its confusing, with only gestures
2. we have a whole os, this is just a reader, not integrated with our stuff
3. the author doesnt like contributors - he accepted my pull request after a year, some not at all.
4. the code is really overcomplicated ( its really good, just overcomplicated in my opinion )
5. from what i heard from some users its laggy ( not in my experience )
6. the code - its pure rust, without adding any GUI framework - i can promise you you will never see there any statistics charts - in Qt its easier, a few clicks. Us using Qt makes us superior to koreader plato. we can make fancy gui without much effort, where koreader is all menu based and in plato its hard - just look how much of a good UI and GUI features we have while only working on it for 3 years, mostly by 1 then 2 persons

lololol? it uses mupdf like us. i think he has problems with rendering?


[7/30/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
lols


[7/30/2023 10:47 PM] szybet
as long as qt and mupdf supports this formatting, we are good to go


[7/30/2023 10:48 PM] kuratius
I'm talking about furigana and vertical text.
Vertical text being broken is acceptable, furigana isnt


[7/30/2023 10:48 PM] kuratius
Also I'm now wondering if there is an epub->latex converter somewhere


[7/30/2023 10:49 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
on every reader I tried except inkbox the formatting worked just as I shown in calibre


[7/30/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
you are looking for html > latex

and yes, they exist


[7/30/2023 10:49 PM] szybet
look at pandoc maybe

i still dont understand your problem


[7/30/2023 10:49 PM] kuratius
that may fix all the issues I have with Japanese books if it works ok


[7/30/2023 10:50 PM] szybet
its hard to find somewhere in dev channel. basically its faster, and the pages dont cut


[7/30/2023 10:50 PM] kuratius
latex supports all the formatting needed


[7/30/2023 10:50 PM] matterbridge#2154

ah great

6 the statistics chart would be reaaly cool so yea thats a big - for me


[7/30/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
chars look bad on monochrome displays :D


[7/30/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
look up sanki video, its not great


[7/30/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
but maybe we will implement it


[7/30/2023 10:51 PM] szybet
dont expect it in the near future, maybe ever


[7/30/2023 10:52 PM] szybet
at least from me and nicolas to develop it


[7/30/2023 10:52 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡️ (@mg:maximiliangaedig.com) 
well I mean the statistics part of it is really the important one


[7/30/2023 10:53 PM] [matrix] Maximilian Gaedig ⚡
a historic chart would be cool tho


[7/30/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
i wont have propably time after summer, nicolas too


[7/30/2023 10:53 PM] szybet
also there are other priorities as for software for us

also I can get pandoc to output latex, but it's not a valid .tex file


[7/30/2023 11:41 PM] kuratius
I checked with pandoc's pdf output, it doesnt correctly parse the furigana anyway

even pandoc?

you could just convert to pdf with the right tool

probably calibre works

but still

did you know python interpreter launches on kobos for 30 seconds?

and maybe a markdown renderer with ruby support that's in C or something

Proper ruby text () syntax support in Markdown
It is fairly common for East Asian languages (mostly CJK characters) to have ruby texts annotations; not only do they provide phonetic guides, the actual meaning of text might even differ without labeling.  This technique is currently implemented in HTML as a set of   tags, as demonstrated.  (refer to MDN for details)   躊（ㄔㄡˊ） 躇（ㄔㄨˊ）   両人（ふたり）  ...

this one


[7/31/2023 12:16 AM] kuratius

no way it should take that long to start the interpreter

Idk


[7/31/2023 12:51 AM] szybet
Still it was so slow i replaced everything with rust


[7/31/2023 12:52 AM] kuratius

the microlatex package I showed before wouldnt work?

How dp you render it


[7/31/2023 12:54 AM] kuratius
microlatex package has a renderer


[7/31/2023 12:54 AM] kuratius
so probably just write to framebuffer


[7/31/2023 12:54 AM] szybet
After ypu render it, how do you make it fit the screen?


[7/31/2023 12:54 AM] kuratius
probably options in microlatex


[7/31/2023 12:54 AM] kuratius
it can run command line


[7/31/2023 12:55 AM] szybet
And split into pages?...


[7/31/2023 12:55 AM] kuratius
technically fully-featured latex can do that, idk about microlatex, will check

this says the dictionary files contain normal strings, so probably you can replace the font somewhere or outright swap the characters brute force?

Here mostly to watch for PW5 kernel availability, but might grab something else if bluetooth keyboards are working


[8/3/2023 5:03 PM] szybet
PW5?


[8/3/2023 5:04 PM] straykneazle
Kindle Paperwhite 5


[8/3/2023 5:04 PM] straykneazle
an ereader that can also have a nicer keyboard paired up to be a dumb terminal for remote ssh is the dream


[8/3/2023 5:04 PM] szybet
idk if its locked up


[8/3/2023 5:04 PM] szybet
well we have that with usb keyboard already


[8/3/2023 5:05 PM] straykneazle
Yeah, having bluetoth working is just icing from a portable setup perspective.  No cable sticking out of the device to snag or break.


[8/3/2023 5:06 PM] szybet
well my usb setup doesnt have any cables ;p


[8/3/2023 5:06 PM] straykneazle
How'd you rig it up?

InkBox OS user app: ITerm (sff) demo
ITerm or InkBox Terminal (originally sff), is a Qt-native app using libvterm for interacting with a tty, allowing an user to run shell commands on their device without the need of launching an X11 app which usually takes more time.

ITerm was ported from @jsbronder's sff and its source code is available there: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/sff

Hello !


[8/4/2023 10:43 AM] szybet
Hello


[8/4/2023 10:45 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I'm starting with ereaders, thinking of buying a Pocketbook Color (named Vivlio Color in France), but wanting to open this ereader as much as possible. I've red the Inkbox wiki and the Pocketbook Color is not supported. Do you think it will happen in the future ?


[8/4/2023 10:45 AM] szybet
if someone does it, then it will


[8/4/2023 10:46 AM] szybet
if no one does it, it won't


[8/4/2023 10:46 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
You mean there is no major blockers ?


[8/4/2023 10:46 AM] szybet
95% it won't because of lack of people willing to port


[8/4/2023 10:46 AM] szybet
not sure. for now the blocker are as mentioned lack of people


[8/4/2023 10:47 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I was talking of blockers like hard to impossible reverse engineering, like it sometimes happens


[8/4/2023 10:48 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I'm pretty aware that humans are necessary to complete a porting


[8/4/2023 10:48 AM] szybet
not sure, some models like kobo nia model c can take 2 weekends to port, some like the sony ereader months of work and all of that for nothing because it simply won't work


[8/4/2023 10:49 AM] szybet
it's a lottery. Kobos have higher chance of being ported


[8/4/2023 10:51 AM] szybet
oh and its multi color, we dont support that at all ( someone would need to add it )


[8/4/2023 10:53 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Oh ok, important information !


[8/4/2023 10:53 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Thank you


[8/4/2023 11:04 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I'm a developer, mostly web, using Linux and tweaking a bit. I could want to contribute in the future (For example Pocketbook support). Is it hard, am I starting from too far ? What should I know/learn to port a device ?


[8/4/2023 11:05 AM] szybet
cpp, linux ( low level ) a bit of electronical knowledge


[8/4/2023 11:06 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Ok, a lot :) (I know cpp, but not low level linux and not a lot in electronical)


[8/4/2023 11:06 AM] szybet
you can obviously learn along the way. the main developers of this project started from almost 0 knowledge and just learned it


[8/4/2023 11:07 AM] szybet
electronics, just basics like seting up a serial console


[8/4/2023 11:07 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Oh ok  !


[8/4/2023 11:07 AM] szybet
linux as in kernel compiling, how an os works etc


[8/4/2023 11:08 AM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I'll have to kernel compile first then :)


[8/4/2023 12:11 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq

[8/4/2023 12:12 PM] szybet
if you are sure thats the one, sure


[8/4/2023 12:12 PM] szybet
also there is risk damaging the ereader while porting, obviously


[8/4/2023 12:13 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
I know


[8/4/2023 12:14 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
What are the other big challenges in porting to an other ereader, admitting you have a working kernel ?


[8/4/2023 12:19 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Btw, the Allwinner documentation says it supports Linux 3.10. Does this mean 3.10 kernel and newer are natively working, or that you can make it work only with 3.10 series ? https://www.allwinnertech.com/uploads/pdf/2016090918361199.pdf

making it to boot
making eink work
making wifi work
usb related things too


[8/4/2023 12:21 PM] szybet
hard to tell. propably newer too if the driver is open source


[8/4/2023 12:22 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Ok ! Thanks for the roadmap ;)


[8/4/2023 12:31 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq
Is Inkbox based on an other distro ? Like Alpine ?


[8/4/2023 12:31 PM] szybet
we use alpine rootfs for half of the system


[8/4/2023 12:31 PM] szybet
literally half, its curred in half


[8/4/2023 12:31 PM] szybet
so we have a package manager


[8/4/2023 12:38 PM] [matrix] Manumerique (@Manumeriq

[8/5/2023 5:55 AM] qiwulun
would you be interested in porting something like Orca?

What? Orca? The animal?


[8/5/2023 12:46 PM] qiwulun
https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca


[8/5/2023 12:47 PM] szybet
its just a cli program written in C


[8/5/2023 12:47 PM] szybet
so it could work, why not


[8/5/2023 12:47 PM] szybet
but i dont see the point? explain further why?


[8/5/2023 1:06 PM] qiwulun
oh, it can be used over a network


[8/5/2023 1:06 PM] qiwulun
it can output MIDI/OSC


[8/5/2023 1:06 PM] qiwulun
so it might be a nice use for an ereader by a musician who'd like a novel midi device


[8/5/2023 1:07 PM] qiwulun
when synced up with a master clock the network issues on a local network wouldn't be a problem


[8/5/2023 1:07 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[8/5/2023 1:19 PM] qiwulun
might be a good first project for me 🙂

is it usable for everyday use? yes? better than those cli clients

honestly the cli client is good enough for me except for image display

are you on an ereader at all?

I have a kobo glo hd microsd card which when I run lsblk on my system I get these partitions:

do I run dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 like it says on github or do I choose something like mmcblk0p3?

cool, @tux-linux look ;)


[8/8/2023 2:54 PM] [matrix] saligari (@saligari:mat
from what I understand it doesn't sync over ankiweb, you have to do it locally?


[8/8/2023 2:54 PM] szybet
sanki runs on nickel too, but as of support for it and features, its better on inkbox


[8/8/2023 2:55 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] saligari (@saligari:matrix.org) 
yeah I saw you recently added support and I thought to try it out on inkbox to be sure it works as intended


[8/8/2023 2:55 PM] szybet
ankiweb doesnt have an public API, so you need to sync over with your local sanki app, using my program that exports it


[8/8/2023 2:55 PM] szybet
fast and easy on linux so no worries


[8/8/2023 2:56 PM] szybet
as for sanki on inkbox, you can expect from me really fast bug fixes if there were any needed ;)

for the moment I'm mostly using decks without images so I feel I should be fine


[8/8/2023 2:59 PM] szybet
images are fully supported, the only problem is they must be resized while creating the deck


[8/8/2023 2:59 PM] szybet
otherwise they will overflow the screen and scrollbars will appear


[8/8/2023 2:59 PM] [matrix] saligari (@saligari:mat

some plastic set I had for opening up my phone


[8/8/2023 3:13 PM] szybet
try near the edges


[8/8/2023 3:13 PM] szybet
like 1-2 cm from the edges


[8/8/2023 3:14 PM] szybet
insert the tool deep and then try to release the "snaps" of the case


[8/8/2023 3:16 PM] szybet
the first opening is hard - thats why youtube videos showing it can look easy


[8/8/2023 3:16 PM] [matrix] saligari (@saligari:mat
will manage it, I see that inkbox is quite large, it takes up most of the space on my 4gb card, is that normal?

I'd seen somewhere that one can use an 8gb card, don't know if you can use a larger one


[8/8/2023 3:16 PM] szybet
you mean partitions or files in partitions?

Which model number


[8/11/2023 3:20 AM] blix_04447
N236


[8/11/2023 3:20 AM] tux_linux
It's supported


[8/11/2023 3:21 AM] blix_04447
it says there's an SD card in here. i'm assuming i have to take off the back panel and remove it and i can't just flash it connected to my computer?

Yes, basically

Hey guys, I just got inkbox up and running on my N905C. Just trying to figure out if theres a way to change the time/timezone on it? 

I looked through the settings/tried tapping on the actual time in the top right but couldnt find any options, also looked through the wiki a bit but didnt see anything. Am I missing something obvious?

Can anyone here remind me how koreader manages if your highlighted text is on the bottom and a dialog from the bottom appears? is the text hidden then?


[8/21/2023 1:41 PM] tux_linux
The dialog adapts to text position


[8/21/2023 1:41 PM] tux_linux
=nightmare


[8/21/2023 1:41 PM] szybet
adapts how


[8/21/2023 1:42 PM] tux_linux
Sometimes puts itself on top or on the line below the text


[8/21/2023 1:42 PM] szybet
hey thats easy to do


[8/21/2023 1:42 PM] szybet
i can just move the dialog to the top of the screen

we have a kinda working vnc xorg client, there is also a very not working rust vnc client if you want to look into that


[8/23/2023 8:26 AM] szybet
so... it just shows images from another machine?


[8/23/2023 8:26 AM] ewired
if there is a good rust vnc library it wouldn't be super hard to add vnc to plato

there is a server that takes images from a firefox addon then sends them to the kobo


[8/23/2023 8:27 AM] ewired
and takes commands from the kobo and sends them to firefox


[8/23/2023 8:27 AM] szybet
there is one already, it uses plato code but is a seperate app because plato doesnt accept pull request...


[8/23/2023 8:27 AM] szybet
thats cool


[8/23/2023 8:28 AM] szybet
how does it work? on eink? a demo would be cool


[8/23/2023 8:28 AM] ewired
I will record a demo real quick

[8/23/2023 8:28 AM] szybet
we would love to see your app ported to Inkbox


[8/23/2023 8:31 AM] szybet
as I mentioned, sadly dont expect it merged to plato - the author doesnt accept pull request - he accepted my fixes for emulator after a year
https://github.com/baskerville/plato/pull/281
this nice app wasn't accepted at all
there is a fork of plato because of all of that

[8/23/2023 8:41 AM] szybet
this works great! its so much better than the vnc client that barely works ( even our xorg one )!


[8/23/2023 8:41 AM] ewired
I like this better than vnc because it's like the browser on-device and not generalized to any desktop mouse input


[8/23/2023 8:41 AM] szybet
yep, so much better


[8/23/2023 8:41 AM] ewired
though you can write a program that sends any images you want to the server, it just has to use a websocket


[8/23/2023 8:42 AM] szybet
yep i understand the concept


[8/23/2023 8:42 AM] ewired
all plato gestures are encoded with serde and sent as-is, so that might be a problem for alternative implementations


[8/23/2023 8:42 AM] ewired
unless everyone wants to be json type compatible with plato gestures


[8/23/2023 8:42 AM] ewired
or a more generic gesture protocol is designed


[8/23/2023 8:43 AM] szybet
nah this is fine


[8/23/2023 8:43 AM] szybet
there is no standard for sending gestures across network


[8/23/2023 8:43 AM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[8/23/2023 8:44 AM] ewired
I'm glad you like it, where is the active fork of plato?


[8/23/2023 8:45 AM] szybet
well idk and idk if its still active


[8/23/2023 8:45 AM] szybet
i might port your app to InkBox in the far future if you wont


[8/23/2023 8:46 AM] ewired
currently I just have a clara 2e so I don't want to chance bricking it with another firmware, but yeah, the netpbm format has a lot of libraries, and the gestures have to be plato compatible, and that's all you'd need


[8/23/2023 8:47 AM] ewired
I am going to add a local and remote menu system


[8/23/2023 8:47 AM] ewired
also I originally was going to use a websocket server directly on the device and go straight from firefox to kobo, but I couldn't accept tcp connections with rust, that was a huge pain to figure out lol


[8/23/2023 8:48 AM] ewired
it was like "function not implemented" or something similar


[8/23/2023 8:48 AM] ewired
on the device only


[8/23/2023 8:48 AM] szybet
well i understand

I will just purge plato code and launch this  app directly


[8/23/2023 10:10 AM] kuratius
Inkbox install requires swapping sd cards anyway, you can't actually brick your original one


[8/23/2023 10:11 AM] szybet
but you can damage your device, especially when porting ( 2e is not supported... )


[8/23/2023 10:11 AM] szybet
so i didnt encoureged him to do it


[8/23/2023 10:11 AM] szybet
i understand the fear, I had those thoughts when porting the nia A


[8/23/2023 10:12 AM] szybet
well i ended up with the most modified nia on the planet so... fear goes away when knowledge goes in


[8/23/2023 10:13 AM] ewired
I don't even know where the SD card is at lol


[8/23/2023 10:13 AM] ewired
all I see is a USB-C port


[8/23/2023 10:13 AM] szybet
well, inside ;p


[8/23/2023 10:13 AM] ewired
I guess there is a back plate I could remove yeah


[8/23/2023 10:13 AM] szybet
well if you want you could do it


[8/23/2023 10:14 AM] ewired
I would have to use a spudger to get into it I think


[8/23/2023 10:14 AM] szybet
we already compiled the clara 2e kernel, you know how to code so, the way is straight forward to do it really


[8/23/2023 10:14 AM] szybet
yep


[8/23/2023 10:14 AM] szybet
+ support in qt platform plugin exists


[8/23/2023 10:15 AM] szybet
if you are interested, create a thread at #porting and ping me there


[8/23/2023 10:15 AM] szybet
also if you plan to create more apps for kobo, we support user apps for inkbox which makes things easier


[8/23/2023 10:18 AM] ewired
I may get another kobo with a bigger display, then I will be willing to tinker with the clara 2e


[8/23/2023 10:18 AM] ewired
I'm really happy with how relatively open the kobo platform is


[8/23/2023 10:19 AM] szybet
yep


[8/23/2023 10:19 AM] szybet
sadly nickel very often ( even without updated ) removes nickel menu and others so that can be an issue


[8/23/2023 10:20 AM] szybet
so here is inkbox

@ewired where is the browser extension source code?...


[8/25/2023 8:53 AM] ewired

[8/25/2023 8:53 AM] ewired
trying to keep everything in the same repo


[8/25/2023 8:53 AM] szybet
ok cool


[8/25/2023 8:53 AM] ewired
the server is contrib/remote-display-server.ts and it runs in deno like `deno run -A contrib/remote-display-server.ts` and you need to have imagemagick installed for `convert`


[8/25/2023 8:54 AM] szybet
sure


[8/25/2023 8:54 AM] szybet
idk when i will be able to make it a standalone app to port it to inkbox


[8/25/2023 8:54 AM] szybet
maybe you will be interested in doing something like that?


[8/25/2023 8:55 AM] szybet
because it will be never accepted to the main source code sadly


[8/25/2023 8:55 AM] ewired
can inkbox run plato already? or does it need to be made to use xorg?


[8/25/2023 8:55 AM] szybet
i ported plato sketch as a standalone app


[8/25/2023 8:55 AM] szybet
so yes, it can natively


[8/25/2023 8:56 AM] ewired
where do you have that port of plato sketch? I can look at that and copy what you did

i purged plato's code while remaining the backend, and launched sketch


[8/25/2023 8:58 AM] szybet
you would need  few dialogs to input the ip / port of the server propably so its more complicated


[8/25/2023 8:58 AM] ewired
yeah I need to add that to my current fork of plato first


[8/25/2023 8:58 AM] szybet
sure


[8/25/2023 8:59 AM] szybet
if you would do that, creating a user app would take me 5 minutes packaging it, so it would be awesome


[8/25/2023 9:03 AM] ewired
yeah I can get it separated to where I launch it independently from plato via nickelmenu


[8/25/2023 9:03 AM] szybet
yep, you could also do that with the same binary

 I have dug up my libra h2o and want to see if I can inkbox it.


[8/27/2023 9:37 AM] b3nj4m1nx
but it does seem to have it's SD card soldered to the board :/


[8/27/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
you would need to port it


[8/27/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
yes, the soldered eemc is a problem but we could live with it


[8/27/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
as in pinned comment about porting:


[8/27/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
```
Hard? Maybe, impossible? Maybe, but easy? Maybe too? Time consuming so most people give up? Certainly
```


[8/27/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
anyway Hi


[8/27/2023 10:11 AM] b3nj4m1nx
Thx for the info. I was a little confused initially because I thought there was already a port for it


[8/27/2023 10:11 AM] szybet
idk if there is


[8/27/2023 10:12 AM] szybet
look up #porting thread for it

E-ink is so Retropunk
I’ve long been struggling to describe why e-ink is so much fun for me, but Ithink I’ve finally realized what it is: e-ink is just so so so retropunk.


[8/27/2023 10:29 AM] b3nj4m1nx
It mentions Inkbox


[8/27/2023 10:30 AM] b3nj4m1nx
that article may have been posted in hn also


[8/27/2023 10:31 AM] szybet
This explain a lot


[8/27/2023 10:31 AM] szybet
well its a cool article


[8/27/2023 10:31 AM] szybet
thanks for answering


[8/27/2023 10:32 AM] szybet
@tux-linux mystery solved


[8/27/2023 10:32 AM] b3nj4m1nx
Np. I heard of the project a little while back but there was no support for N873 at the time


[8/27/2023 10:33 AM] szybet
almost no one is willing to port devices


[8/27/2023 10:33 AM] szybet
i dont think any contributor ported one? only I and the creator of the project, nicolas


[8/27/2023 10:35 AM] b3nj4m1nx
Yeah the wiki confused me because it's listed as supported but the general installation instructions talk of removing the card


[8/27/2023 10:35 AM] b3nj4m1nx
So I guess I'm out of luck


[8/27/2023 10:36 AM] b3nj4m1nx
very cool project regardless


[8/27/2023 10:36 AM] szybet
really?


[8/27/2023 10:36 AM] szybet
um


[8/27/2023 10:36 AM] szybet
then its supported


[8/27/2023 10:36 AM] szybet
but hard to install


[8/27/2023 10:40 AM] szybet
easy to brick the device that **you** propably wouldn't be able to unbrick it


[8/27/2023 10:42 AM] [matrix] vesto
hi everyone! quick question that I'm sure has been answered before but I can't seem to find an up-to-date answer anywhere from some searching: is there any support for the clara HD yet? I've seen this[0] repo, but it seems like it's a scarier path towards a working inkbox installation than there is for other devices.

until you know linux better than windows and know electronics to the level of cutting off traces and resoldering them then dont do it, if you brick it you wont be able to unbrick it

[8/27/2023 10:42 AM] [matrix] vesto
!!! that's very exciting


[8/27/2023 10:43 AM] [matrix] vesto
potentially! what kind of help would be useful?


[8/27/2023 10:44 AM] szybet
c++ / c / kernel dev for the problems we are facing now


[8/27/2023 10:44 AM] [matrix] vesto
oof, that may be out of my line of expertise unfortunately :(


[8/27/2023 10:44 AM] szybet
i could send you the porting thread on discord as a html file if you are interested in looking at that


[8/27/2023 10:44 AM] szybet
well ok, sure


[8/27/2023 10:45 AM] szybet
later we will need testers for this device


[8/27/2023 10:45 AM] [matrix] vesto
I mean, I'm a decent engineer but I've yet to venture into the low-level world of kernel dev


[8/27/2023 10:45 AM] [matrix] vesto
yeah that I think I could be interested in helping with!


[8/27/2023 10:46 AM] b3nj4m1nx

[8/27/2023 10:47 AM] szybet
well if you are an engineer, then you can propably c++ and stuff?
We will have many places in the system need adjustment for the clara

I can ask the guys there if you could help with anything if you want


[8/27/2023 10:49 AM] [matrix] vesto
it does sound like it could be an interesting learning experience in all honesty, I just don't want to commit myself to something and then bail out to the detriment of the project


[8/27/2023 10:49 AM] szybet
i will ask then, dont expect a fast answer tho


[8/27/2023 10:51 AM] [matrix] vesto
no worries. I'll stick around in this matrix channel to feel free to ping me if there's something I can be of use for.

@b3nj 

or other people who have a lobster account, can you tell that guy that:
- tolinos are almost kobos, inkbox images work for their tolinos counter part very often
- InkBox has a full blown RSS guard ported to it, as a user app

[8/28/2023 9:47 AM] [matrix] vesto
I'm a p good technical writer


[8/28/2023 9:48 AM] szybet
if you are interested, you can migrate the wiki to github wiki


[8/28/2023 9:48 AM] szybet
and add there the clara info there


[8/28/2023 9:49 AM] szybet
or just write there only about the clara, your decission
So you want the export of the chat?


[8/28/2023 9:49 AM] [matrix] vesto
is the project on github or gitlab? the official website points to the GL repos


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] [matrix] vesto
yeah sure I can take a peek. I'd say I need to try installing it on my clara myself before I can properly write up the docs but I think I can do that.


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] szybet
it was on gitlab, but as the project grow from 1 developer to 2, we are migrating to github


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] [matrix] vesto
if I just use a different SD card I can put the original back in if I screw it up, right?


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] szybet
yep, no problem with that


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] [matrix] vesto
oh yeah that's like no risk then


[8/28/2023 9:50 AM] [matrix] vesto

[8/30/2023 6:43 PM] dtw_2005
hello, I have a couple of questions.  i picked up an n613 just to try out this project.  I'm trying to figure out a good way to move books around.  My calibre server is on a windows box, and the inkbox USB connection doesn't seem to be recognized.  It works just fine on my linux box.  So, I guess, first question, should windows be able to recognize the inbox device (for calibre book management)?   Second question, I have to turn on wifi and manually connect frequently.  I'm sorta under the impression there may be some rooting involved for better hardware control and auto wifi connection, ssh stuff.  If I need to do that, can you point me in the right direction?  Third question, I see that syncthing is a thing.  That may be my best direction for book management.  I don't see much on the readme, but this is clearly a newish addon for inkbox.  I looked at the create.sh file on github, and I'm seeing some ssh stuff which leads me to believe I need to investigate rooting a bit further.  Just reading through history, @Szybet mentions "update rootfs and use sything app"  ... Can you point this inkbox-noob in the right direction?  I think I need to root this, but I'm not searching for the right thing.


[8/30/2023 6:55 PM] szybet
hello
1. windows should, if it doesnt and linux does, then we cant do anything about it. We dont support callibre
2. you can automate things for sure, you need to root the device first, to do it:
-- turn off the device
-- when its booting up, spam the power button many times
-- then in diagnostics select reset and root

3. you dont need to create the syncthing app, the script is for me to automate deployment - First root the device, then I will explain updating the rootfs


[8/30/2023 7:09 PM] dtw_2005
thank you for the response.  
1.  I guess it doesn't really matter why i'm having a windows connection issue if calibre support isn't there.  I'd prefer syncthing to plugging it in.  
2.  hmm, okay.  I will figure this out and follow up.  I don't have the right timing, yet.  I've attempted a few times.


[8/30/2023 7:15 PM] szybet
you need to spam the button very early


[8/30/2023 7:15 PM] szybet
or try the resert button too


[8/30/2023 7:15 PM] szybet
im not sure


[8/30/2023 7:15 PM] dtw_2005
Hey, I got it.  You really really have to spam the crap out of the power "slide".  The led cycles between blue and green a bit, and finally flashed between green and off rapidly.   So, reset and root, it prompts "onboard storage size (MiB)": with a default of "64".   Any reason to change it?


[8/30/2023 7:23 PM] szybet
yep, change to 512


[8/30/2023 7:23 PM] szybet
the defailt is stupid really


[8/30/2023 7:24 PM] szybet
its still small


[8/30/2023 7:24 PM] szybet
also: it will take long to make, consider connecting it to power and leaving it for half an hour


[8/30/2023 7:26 PM] dtw_2005
i really appreciate the info, and quick response ... i'll do that.  I also have 1024 as an option.  I'm not sure if the options are based on sd card size or some other chip on the device.  should i spring for 1024?  thanks again.


[8/30/2023 7:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
how big is your sd card


[8/30/2023 7:27 PM] dtw_2005
16gb


[8/30/2023 7:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
then go with 1024


[8/30/2023 7:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you can expend it to 10Gb later manually anyway


[8/30/2023 7:28 PM] dtw_2005
i understand.  cool and thanks.


[8/31/2023 3:02 AM] dtw_2005
Rooting on the n613 was successful.  I searched discord history and saw that I needed to 'enable USBNet flag' to enable ssh ... I was able to ssh into the kobo: root/root .  All good!  How do I install the syncthing app from the repo and configure it?  I've been using syncthing for a while now.  I'm a big fan, it's changed the way I use computers.


[8/31/2023 7:49 AM] szybet
let's make it as easy as possible


[8/31/2023 7:50 AM] szybet
execute the command that is gived to you at login to make the rootfs rw


[8/31/2023 7:50 AM] szybet
ifsctl rw mnt something something


[8/31/2023 7:55 AM] [matrix] Szybet
then use nano /etc/init.d/gui_apps  and replace the file with the content of this one 
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/gui_apps
and then run sshfs, download the syncthing zip from user apps repo and extract it to /data/onboard/.apps/
then run sync on both devices
then reboot the device
if it doesn't appear in apps, inside ssh run `echo true > /kobo/tmp/rescan_userapps` and then `killall inkbox-bin`


[8/31/2023 7:56 AM] szybet
and that's all


[8/31/2023 7:57 AM] szybet
keep in mind that if it doesn't launch from gui, report it and I will supply a small update to make it work
+ your device has almost no ram, cpu power compared to regular syncthing-used machines, don't use it harsh


[9/1/2023 2:06 AM] dtw_2005
all worked.   I did not have to run the last rescan and killall command.    I'm having a bit of trouble getting to the webUI of syncthing.  Should I be able to hit the 8384 port via browser from a different device on the network, or is the intention to load the kobo web browser to hit the webUI to configure.  ~~I tried both, the latter has resulted in a white screen of death of sorts (?)~~ paperclip reset ...


[9/1/2023 2:18 AM] dtw_2005
I'm not sure what I did differently, but after it went to sleep and woke back up, the webGUI started responding to external devices.  Thank you x2 for the awesomeness and the help on getting it setup.


[9/1/2023 4:22 AM] dtw_2005
I have an observation.  I found that several instances of trying to ssh, ping, or setup syncthing ... the device was connected to wifi, but it seems that once connected, I needed to put it to sleep and then wake it up before the device services would respond.  I'm not sure if that's helpful, but most of the roadblocks I hit seemed to be tied to odd wifi connected but no responses from the device.  Also, I believe you implied the n613 is very underpowered.   which kobo should one get to truly get a good experience for the inkbox system?


[9/1/2023 4:23 AM] tux_linux
to get decent system performance, I suggest the glo hd n437 or nia n306
glo hd is better imo, more ram (512 mb vs 256 mb for the nia)


[9/1/2023 4:23 AM] tux_linux
as for wi-fi, it's odd


[9/1/2023 10:35 AM] [matrix] Szybet
No idea about wifi issues


[9/1/2023 10:47 AM] [matrix] Szybet
replacing one ereader with another doesnt make much sense


[9/1/2023 10:47 AM] [matrix] Szybet
maybe only if you have a lot of money to throw arround, otherwise not really ( kobo touch is bad, replacing it would be reasonable, the rest is fine )


[9/2/2023 12:26 AM] dtw_2005
I agree, and unfortunately that's not my situation.  

I wasn't sure if the "your device has almost no ram ..." bit was implying that the n613 was subpar or if it was a general sentiment about managing expectations of a low powered e-ink book reader.  I'm very surprised that you were able to get some version of syncthing integrated.  I bought this device for next to nothing only because I've kept an eye on this project for a while.  If I have an opportunity to snag  an n437 for cheap, I may based on @tux-linux  input.  At any rate, thank you both.  I'm not sure who is who, but it seems you 2 are the core dev's ... I just sent one of you guys a few beers (maybe ... not sure on CAD).

I love green tea but a lot of claims are very exaggerated, and a sign of something having improvements is not 'proof'. You can read more here....

even CEGEP here is 150+ pages of assignments each week and that's not counting reading and studying

CEGEP
A CEGEP ( say-ZHEP or  SEE-jep; French pronunciation: ​[seʒɛp]), also written cégep, CÉGEP and cegep, is a publicly funded college providing technical, academic, vocational or a mix of programs; they are exclusive to the province of Quebec's education system. A loanword from French, it originates from the French acronym for Collège d'enseignemen...

Support is only there for original 2011 Kindle touch


[9/11/2023 2:14 AM] dandelionkoi
Understandable.  
Do you know of anywhere to buy an Inkbox OS device?  Due to low-vision issues, I'm likely to destroy a lot of plastic cases before I figure it out by touch if I try to get to the sd card.  It would be a lot easier to buy one.


[9/11/2023 2:15 AM] dandelionkoi
$5 a chance, I could afford, but $30-$70 a chance, not so much.


[9/11/2023 2:16 AM] kuratius
the closest thing to that would be hoping pine64 gets off their asses and gets their pineNote back in production so someone can make an inkbox image for it (can reflash OS without opening)


[9/11/2023 2:17 AM] kuratius
@tux-linux kindle touch doesnt have an sd card right?


[9/11/2023 2:17 AM] kuratius
maybe that is also an option if he can do it without opening it


[9/11/2023 2:17 AM] dandelionkoi
it wouldn't have to be a kindle.  It's just the really old kindles seemed to be the least expensive


[9/11/2023 2:17 AM] kuratius
your criteria are not opening the device right?


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] dandelionkoi
i was thinking, next best thing over getting the skills myself, support others through circular economy


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] kuratius
I'd still say just ask a friend to do it for you


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] kuratius
it's faster and less hassle


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] kuratius
buy a well supported cheap kobo


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] dandelionkoi
yeah, that's a good idea


[9/11/2023 2:18 AM] dandelionkoi
thanks


[9/16/2023 10:51 AM] dandelionkoi
good news, i think i found the right friend to help


[9/16/2023 10:54 AM] dandelionkoi
all of the kobos require opening the case, right?


[9/16/2023 10:54 AM] [matrix] Szybet

Hi. Amazing project. Is it possible for newer devices? Especially kindle

No
Those have secure boot


[9/16/2023 6:16 PM] tux_linux
The most recent device supported is either libra h2o or clara hd (***very*** experimental)


[9/16/2023 6:17 PM] [matrix] Szybet

I just bought a used kobo nia from ebay.  it made sense to go with one of the two most supported models,.  between those, the decision was made by the fact the nia has an Esperanto name.  "nia" means "our" in Esperanto for anyone who didn't know


[9/17/2023 12:55 AM] dandelionkoi
should be here in about a week


[9/17/2023 12:56 AM] dandelionkoi
any advice on opening the case?  what would you tell a sorta blind kindergartner who asked how to open a kobo nia case?


[9/17/2023 12:57 AM] tux_linux

first read questions as they popped into my head:
what's a flex cable?  i know what a button and a usb port are
avoid them, so make sure i don't stick picks/nails/things in there, and don't touch them, right? 
i did watch some kobo disassembly videos, and someone had gloves. is that necessary, if i do a lot of things by touch? i can see they're prying.  it looked like a lot started at the corner.  i think someone said start by the power button, but that's wrong, right?
which part is the battery connector? maybe skip that step for me
thank you, Szybet


[9/17/2023 11:56 AM] dandelionkoi
i guessed a wave form is the type of electric current that changes the ink, and i just looked it up.  it seems like it's a physical device that controls the electric current that changes the ink, right?

[9/17/2023 12:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
yep

well, maybe it? :D
we will see... we dont have time now to port anythign anyway


[9/17/2023 10:26 PM] dandelionkoi
still waiting for my kobo so i can try inkbox.   
there's lots of kobo models supported already, and tehy're easy to find on used stuff sites like ebay.  
my hope for what you decide to do with your donation, is expand the functionality of the existing models.  
I'd like to be able to use Session, Signal (molly), and Telegram from my Inkbox, and that would make it much more useful to me.


[9/17/2023 10:31 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
Telegram has a Qt client, so it's maybe possible
as for Signal ( Session? ) idk, the problem with them they have only one client written in typescript for electron, so it's impossible. A work arround for it is to use matrix ( we have already 2 clients for it ) and bridge the services


[9/17/2023 10:36 PM] tux_linux
Session is impossible or anything else w/ electron probably


[9/17/2023 10:36 PM] tux_linux
Too much bloat


[9/17/2023 10:36 PM] tux_linux

via pidgin


[9/17/2023 10:37 PM] dandelionkoi
okay, sometime in the next few months, i'll probably buy a libra...or a clara


[9/17/2023 10:37 PM] dandelionkoi
does pidgin work without giving a phone number?


[9/17/2023 10:38 PM] dandelionkoi
as an esperanto speaker, i have a lot of community in the 3rd world, and something with as few barriers to participation as possible is desireable


[9/17/2023 10:38 PM] [matrix] andi1

if you are technical enough, you could bridge matrix to telegram

when talking to tech people, i feel like a kindergartner with adult language skills  my level is so basic next to yours.  "explain it like you're talking to a slow preschooler, please"  how many times have i typed that in forums?


[9/17/2023 11:37 PM] dandelionkoi
would briar work on inkbox?


[9/17/2023 11:37 PM] dandelionkoi
that's another one with no phone required, right?

[9/17/2023 11:39 PM] [matrix] Szybet
why dont use matrix?...


[9/17/2023 11:39 PM] dandelionkoi

which client do you use on inkbox?

i'm trying to make a bridge between element and discord using matrix.  anything important to know about the *name field under "create an application"?  is that like a username, or should i name it element or matrix so i know it connects that way?


[9/18/2023 12:24 AM] kuratius
I think application is more like a catchall term for the server name


[9/18/2023 12:25 AM] kuratius
call it inkbox bridge maybe


[9/18/2023 12:25 AM] kuratius
or whatever server it is for


[9/18/2023 12:28 AM] dandelionkoi
okay, so making a bridge that way will take me to inkbox, and if i want a bridge for the esperanto discord i'm a part of, make that a separate bridge and name it "esperanto usa bridge" and if i have another, do that too? 
that one bridge won't connect to the 4 discords i'm a part of?

i ordered plastic opening tools and an some anti-static stuff.  This will be an adventure for me.

For the sd card, the instructions say a minimum of 4 gb.  If I flash and put in a 32gb card, would that just give me more space to store data?  Is there a maximum number?

You can use a filesystem resizing tool to expand it to fill the size of the whole SD card storage

Oh, because of the overlayfs?

Because books re stored in a filesystem in file "onboard" file

if you are porting inkbox to clara 2e and live in USA (maybe canada?), I can sell you one and its sleepcover for $75 paypal + USPS (maybe UPS?) shipping, it has a 1.5cm screen scratch but it's functionally like new, haven't had it for more than a year


[9/19/2023 7:27 AM] ewired
I suspect that it may not be waterproof anymore and the scratch kinda bothers me, I want to get a new clara 2e or maybe a libra 2, but I don't want this clara 2e to be e-wasted


[9/19/2023 9:38 AM] [matrix] joe (@joe:joeth.uk)
Really cool project. Before I install, I'd like to know if you can change the layout of the ebook reader to something more similar to the stock one on kobo (i.e. swipe/tap a side to change the page, tap at the top for settings) as I would prefer to use the whole screen for the text rather than having a back/forward/settings bar at the bottom.


[9/19/2023 10:30 AM] [matrix] Szybet

your approach didn't make sense to me, people write duplicate apps all the time, people write stuff for fun


[9/24/2023 12:34 AM] db.qp.db
if you want people to collaborate, they need to be motivated or see a positive reason, especially with hobby code


[9/24/2023 12:35 AM] db.qp.db
you can get your stuff working on rM, there's an eink plugin for it called qsgepaper or something similar

Yes i do know that but

1000x linux distros dont make sense so this doesnt too

i don't care what it looks like if the screen is nice and it works


[9/24/2023 12:48 AM] dandelionkoi
it's hard to push the other side away in a way that doesn't make the screen flex


[9/24/2023 12:50 AM] szybet
???

You insert the thin tool in the middle where the 2 plastic pieces meet and then you pull it to the "outside" until it comes off a bit, or until a click

Its obviously more complicated than that, you need to try to push it a bit more, use not too much force otherwise it will be bad etc.


[9/24/2023 12:51 AM] szybet
I dont see when the screen would bend in this process


[9/24/2023 12:52 AM] kuratius

i saw someone in another video open it with their fingernails while holding it with the other had.  I tried that, and more the front started flexing that the back came off.  After that, I decided, I'd better keep this on a flat surface because "bad things"


[9/24/2023 12:54 AM] kuratius
Basically you just move along the side

Dont go too deeply or you might hit ribbon cables

@Szybet  Author of RmAnki here, just want to clarify some things up

- When I first had the idea of creating RmAnki, it was because there was no other app specifically for the remarkable device for it - I wanted to create a dedicated one, using my own library I had created as a fun project. (I do all of this from my spare time, as a hobby with no intention of ever monetizing it). I hadn't even found your project so don't think I was trying to copy your "original" idea. 
- I found the way you opened the issue a bit rude, certainly a lack of manners - if you want to collaborate with someone that's not the way to do it. I understand English may not be your first language but in that case you should be more careful of the way you present yourself. 
- (see attachment) Why insult someones work and then expect them to collaborate with you? I also don't see a problem with fixed sizes - its specifically for the rm device of fixed dimensions.
- Where is the motivation for me to stop working on something I've dedicated a lot of time to, and move to your project instead? I'm also not going to learn another whole language just because you're unhappy there is another similar app to yours. If you have the mindset of there should only be one app for everything, then I've got some bad news for you....

[9/24/2023 2:25 PM] jake.skii
Anyway, my decision is final and I'd appreciate it if you didn't reopen the issue. Your app does look really nice, and I'm sure with a bit of work would be able to easily get ported over the RM (and I'd love to see that, it'd give more options for people to use & hopefully inspire them to create their own ❤️)


[9/24/2023 2:48 PM] szybet
- Ye i understand
- As i mentioned before, that was supposed to be a joke, like how could i be serious with "developing the wheel once again"🤨?
- I don't insult you but "Those apps" so the rmkit gui framework ( it's that one, isin't it? ). It's obviously fine for what it is, but in the future, for diffrent screen sizes it will be a problem so i dont like it, but i'm aware of the ease of use for such libraries
- I just asked if you were interested in making something bigger and for more people. I do understand there are many the same apps. I just think people should work together, even when they dissagree a bit with something. ( All those linux distros forks are a good example of what to avoid )

Im not "unhappy", im happy that there is even more open source software out there

[10/8/2023 8:10 AM] malgakhalil
soo i have clara 2e


[10/8/2023 8:10 AM] malgakhalil

[10/8/2023 8:10 AM] malgakhalil
i will wait or i can go with othere kobos flash image


[10/8/2023 8:11 AM] malgakhalil
and if i get this os i will lose koreader ?


[10/8/2023 8:11 AM] malgakhalil
and how to know if the os support arabic font !


[10/8/2023 8:11 AM] [matrix] Szybet
someone needs to port it first, trying other images is dangerous

we have koreader too, if you want that

i dont think at all - koreader supports it, propably


[10/8/2023 8:13 AM] malgakhalil
yes koreader support it i test it in nickle


[10/8/2023 8:14 AM] malgakhalil
the main reason why i want to install is the writing app


[10/8/2023 8:14 AM] malgakhalil
i realy want to write in it with keyborad it awsome app


[10/8/2023 8:14 AM] malgakhalil
and there is no app like it in nickle


[10/8/2023 8:14 AM] malgakhalil
but the problem is font and the keyboard


[10/8/2023 8:15 AM] [matrix] Szybet
not only an app - there is no software support on it at all


[10/8/2023 8:15 AM] [matrix] Szybet
well for now you need to wait for someone to port the device


[10/8/2023 8:16 AM] malgakhalil
yes that the first thing , after that can i add a new font to the app and add new keyboard qmap?


[10/8/2023 8:19 AM] [matrix] Szybet
well yes, qt supports arabic fonts so it should be possible to add


[10/8/2023 8:22 AM] malgakhalil
thnx for help so i will wait for someone to port the device like you sad


[10/8/2023 8:54 AM] malgakhalil
@Szybet  a qestion come in mind 😅 😅  can i install FeatherNotes on nickle bcz i only need this app


[10/8/2023 11:44 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Maybe? Hot plugging wont work for sure , many other issues will appear too


[10/8/2023 3:50 PM] malgakhalil
so its bad solu eather

A experienced developer is able to install it, but making an image for a regular user was harder than expected and we didnt had time to do it and school started soo nope


[10/9/2023 11:49 AM] santhosh_01872
I am an experienced developer and can install if files are made avialble

[10/11/2023 12:05 AM] ewired
are kobo devices capable of using BLE?


[10/11/2023 12:06 AM] ewired
soon I will have a meshtastic node, it uses BLE for end-user devices to reach a LoRa mesh network, if the kobo supports BLE I will want to make something with that


[10/11/2023 12:09 AM] [matrix] Szybet
If any devices have BLE built in, they propably can use headphones, thats what they were designed for and i doubt any custom software ( nickel stock one ) will allow you more than that

well with inkbox if you figure out the drivers and figure out bluetooth managing in an old kernel then it's a native linux experience


[10/11/2023 12:12 AM] szybet
kobo devices are just linux machines in custom hardware. Everything is possible with them, it's RPI on hard mode but hey that's more fun


[10/11/2023 12:18 AM] ewired
true, I thought of hooking up a LoRa radio directly by USB-OTG maybe


[10/11/2023 7:23 AM] ewired
my libra 2 has a RTL8723DS wifi adapter module and the realtek site says it supports BLE


[10/11/2023 9:51 AM] dandelionkoi
I had to look up what LoRa was.  License free radio bands that you can use for communication?!


[10/11/2023 9:52 AM] dandelionkoi
How do I contribute to having something that works through LoRa on InkBox and on Postmarket's Kobo Image on the Air Desktop?


[10/11/2023 9:56 AM] dandelionkoi
I explained what I've been learning about e-ink devices and the various software projects to someone who is interested in funding development of a very low vision and blind friendly user interface, and LoRa communication capabilities would be a very desirable feature.


[10/11/2023 10:03 AM] szybet
what are you talking about?


[10/11/2023 10:05 AM] kuratius
Being blind and using a screen as a user interface are typically contradictory


[10/11/2023 10:05 AM] dandelionkoi
some devices have audio and physical buttons, right?


[10/11/2023 10:05 AM] szybet
"some"...


[10/11/2023 10:06 AM] kuratius
also I think they dont actually have audio, just bluetooth


[10/11/2023 10:06 AM] szybet
heh it depends


[10/11/2023 10:06 AM] szybet
;p


[10/11/2023 10:07 AM] dandelionkoi
I heard the hisense a5 and a5 pro are rootable, but not the hisense a7cc or a9


[10/11/2023 10:08 AM] dandelionkoi
Do you know if that's true?


[10/11/2023 10:08 AM] szybet
its true, but those are still shitty chinese phones


[10/11/2023 10:08 AM] dandelionkoi
I think the little hole to the side of the charging hole on my hisense a5 is a 3.5 mm audio jack


[10/11/2023 10:08 AM] kuratius
at that point it has nothing to do with eink


[10/11/2023 10:08 AM] kuratius
just develop for a phone


[10/11/2023 10:09 AM] dandelionkoi
i love my hisense a5


[10/11/2023 10:09 AM] dandelionkoi
yeah, i'm trying to figure out who to connect with who to make that happen


[10/11/2023 10:09 AM] kuratius
yeah but we're talking in the context of making an app for blind people


[10/11/2023 10:09 AM] dandelionkoi
more like an interface


[10/11/2023 10:09 AM] szybet
dont you have problem with english translation, wireless connections?


[10/11/2023 10:10 AM] dandelionkoi
my hisense a7cc doesn't connect to mobile data at all, that's true


[10/11/2023 10:10 AM] dandelionkoi
the hisense a5 did, but mine started to get a swollen battery after being dropped for the nth time


[10/11/2023 10:11 AM] dandelionkoi
it's study btw, survived many falls from at least waist height without a case


[10/11/2023 10:11 AM] kuratius
sturdy


[10/11/2023 10:11 AM] dandelionkoi
it has a voice assitant, but it's in chinese


[10/11/2023 10:11 AM] dandelionkoi
i don't speak chinese


[10/11/2023 10:12 AM] kuratius
are we talking someone who has to spend x amount of money on an accessibility project whose primary concern isnt how useful the project is actually going to be?


[10/11/2023 10:14 AM] dandelionkoi
i think so.  someone i know talked about making it a priority to find making an eink device that does communication stuff and linux stuff functional


[10/11/2023 10:14 AM] szybet
define both of these things


[10/11/2023 10:14 AM] dandelionkoi
i think the project here and the postmarket air desktop might be the furthest along towards something like that from what i can tell


[10/11/2023 10:22 AM] dandelionkoi
ideally,
if a phone, it could make and receive phone calls and text messages and utilize mobile data

can support at least one commonly used messaging program that works over wifi

if on a port to an x86-64 architecture, have control of red, green, and blue diodes, so the monitor can have a 100% contrast them, and have toggle over the warm and the cool lighting if it's an e-ink monitor that has front lighting, and the ability to turn on say, just the red light diode and use the monitor with monocolor light if LED.

An interface similar to the one on the imitation light phone menu, not sure if it's still available on f-droid or not.
It's a text based launcher that just lists all the programs.  It functions well even with text set to huge

Possibly, if on a device with audio or a jack, a voice robot that announces which program is selected by a physical button as one scrolls?

Some flexiblity in the goals based on what's possible and doable


[10/11/2023 10:23 AM] szybet
what if its an ereader? like a kobo?


[10/11/2023 10:25 AM] dandelionkoi
drop the voice goal for that device and focus on low vision


[10/11/2023 10:25 AM] szybet
so what with low vision?


[10/11/2023 10:27 AM] dandelionkoi
have you ever used the light launcher available through fdroid on android?


[10/11/2023 10:28 AM] szybet
nope, explain it


[10/11/2023 10:30 AM] kuratius
maybe just make a software app for 2in1 laptops for blind people


[10/11/2023 10:30 AM] dandelionkoi
If I install it on my hisense a5
when I unlock my phone
the screen defaults to my favoites that I've pinned to the top
It was a list
"Phone
Contacts
QKSMS
Vortaro"


[10/11/2023 10:30 AM] kuratius
there you can at least easily connect a braille reader


[10/11/2023 10:30 AM] dandelionkoi
Then if I scroll past those


[10/11/2023 10:30 AM] szybet
what the fuck


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] kuratius
what


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
every program on my phone is in alphabetical order


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] szybet
oh you mean a hardware solution?


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
with a search bar at the top


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
no, an interface


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
i used a bigger font program


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
and the words on the phone were maybe 24 font


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] dandelionkoi
it was really nice


[10/11/2023 10:31 AM] kuratius
it's a device where you have dozens of little pins forming braille characters depending on where on the screen your cursor is

[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] szybet
well this launcher could be add to inkbox. Then what? those apps are not blind friendly anyway?


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] kuratius
figure out a way to make a 3d printable cheap design


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] kuratius
and write a linux driver for it


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] kuratius
commercial solutions are very expensive iirc


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] kuratius
so this will actually help people


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] szybet
well thats achievable


[10/11/2023 10:33 AM] szybet
someone would need to pay me a lot


[10/11/2023 10:34 AM] szybet
but using electro magnets to move psychically those letters, yea achievable


[10/11/2023 10:34 AM] szybet
or just motors


[10/11/2023 10:35 AM] szybet
a resin printer would be needed


[10/11/2023 10:35 AM] szybet

what does a lot mean to you?  i'll go back to that person with a number
How much for the low-vision friendly interface/home screen/launcher?
how much for an open source hardware braille reader?


[10/11/2023 10:38 AM] kuratius
apparently commercial braille displays are between 1000-6000 $


[10/11/2023 10:38 AM] kuratius
rofl


[10/11/2023 10:39 AM] szybet
First, i dont have time currently for anything, i will have time in june next year

second, Idk? you would need to offer and first describe what exactly you want. I would love to make something open sourced and get paid for it


[10/11/2023 10:42 AM] dandelionkoi
I'm still trying to figure out the github system


[10/11/2023 10:43 AM] dandelionkoi
@Kuratius so you think a text based menu and a braile display would be a good step towards accessibility for totally blind people?


[10/11/2023 10:45 AM] dandelionkoi
@Szybet do you have an opinion on whether it's a port to x86-64 or for one of the small e-ink devices?  Kobo?  Hisense A5?


[10/11/2023 10:46 AM] dandelionkoi
As I work to clarify the project, which way would you suggest, prefer?


[10/11/2023 10:49 AM] dandelionkoi
Hisense A5 Pro?  Better hardware, so if it works on US networks, it might be relevant longer? 
X86-64 with an e-ink monitor and/or braille display?


[10/11/2023 10:54 AM] dandelionkoi
Maybe do an image that's especially for low-vision/blind, that's designed to be a truly frictionless experience,
nothing on it except what works and works very well in those parameters, unless the user chooses to install it


[10/11/2023 10:54 AM] dandelionkoi
Up to 8% of men and .5 % of women are colorblind


[10/11/2023 10:55 AM] dandelionkoi
A text based, simple list launcher/home screen would be easier to use for color blind people, too


[10/11/2023 11:08 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
You mean the launcher menu?


[10/11/2023 11:08 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
Image? What do you mean?


[10/11/2023 11:08 AM] dandelionkoi
Sorry I don't speak computer very well


[10/11/2023 11:09 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
Hisense is chinese nonsense and eink monitors are too expensive

Kobo ereaders are the middle ground of that


[10/11/2023 11:11 AM] dandelionkoi
well, the layout of the home screen of the current inkbox can't easily be changed by a low-ability user, right?


[10/11/2023 11:12 AM] dandelionkoi
so if the home screen was also the launcher, wouldn't it make sense to pick one or two devices to make that the default?


[10/11/2023 11:12 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Nope, but making it low ability is possible


[10/11/2023 11:37 AM] szybet
We could just ship diffrent install images


[10/11/2023 11:37 AM] dandelionkoi
🙂


[10/11/2023 11:38 AM] szybet
Lets say we make this launcher for inkbox, then what? The apps are not so eye friendly anyway?


[10/11/2023 11:38 AM] dandelionkoi
focus on the ones that can be made to work


[10/11/2023 11:39 AM] dandelionkoi
can the reader be made with text menu settings that can be scrolled through and read easily by a braille reader?


[10/11/2023 11:40 AM] szybet
Which ones then. Sanki could for sure


[10/11/2023 11:40 AM] dandelionkoi
Some kind of message app? nabox?


[10/11/2023 11:41 AM] dandelionkoi
So then the text launcher home screen install image could at least have:
reader
sanki
nachat (messages)
text only browser?
Option to install other less tested/perfected apps?


[10/11/2023 11:41 AM] szybet
Maybe, yea propably


[10/11/2023 11:41 AM] dandelionkoi
And do at least those things very, very well


[10/11/2023 11:42 AM] szybet
Nabox? Isint that a blockchain wallet?


[10/11/2023 11:42 AM] dandelionkoi
nachat, i mixed my words

your matrix program, right?


[10/11/2023 11:43 AM] szybet
Yep


[10/11/2023 11:43 AM] szybet
All of this with a braile reader?


[10/11/2023 11:44 AM] dandelionkoi
or a device with audio and microphone 
or if it's not feasible, 
just focus on it being extremely low-vision friendly for various types of low vision


[10/11/2023 11:46 AM] dandelionkoi
i opened an issue on the open braille reader github to ask them for a number so i could tell the potential funder


[10/11/2023 11:47 AM] szybet

The Open Book
This is a complete reimagining of the Open Book Project, but the original mission remains:

As a society, we need an open source device for reading. Books are among the most important documents of our culture, yet the most popular and widespread devices we have for reading are closed objects, operating as small moving parts in a set of giant clo...

Hackaday is a hardware hacking website. It was founded in 2004 as a web magazine

Since 2014, Hackaday also hosts a community database of open-source hardware designs

Hey! I have a Kindle 10th (2020) with 5.15.1 firmware. Hopefully it will be jailbroken soon. I'm interested in porting InkBox to my device.


[10/27/2023 4:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Welcome, propably not possiblr because of bootloader drm


[10/27/2023 6:04 PM] kuratius
If you can figure out how to make the bootloader on it boot a different kernel it's probably doable


[10/27/2023 6:04 PM] kuratius
Or replace it entirely


[10/27/2023 6:05 PM] kuratius
But you have to get serial access first


[10/27/2023 6:05 PM] kuratius
I saw a screenshot showing that the serial port is on the hidden side of the motherboard on a voyage


[10/27/2023 6:06 PM] kuratius
So it may be the case that to check that you would have to remove the motherboard from the screen


[10/27/2023 6:06 PM] kuratius
Or at least remove it from the case entirely


[10/27/2023 6:06 PM] kuratius
(talking to Zoli)


[10/27/2023 6:07 PM] kuratius
I don't think it's worth it unless the kindle is broken or you don't have any other use for it


[10/27/2023 6:07 PM] kuratius
And the flashing process is probably going to be a hassle for other people unless you figure out if there is some sort of usb serial mode


[10/27/2023 6:08 PM] kuratius
Also kindles don't have removable storage so if you brick something you may not recover easily


[10/27/2023 6:09 PM] kuratius
The kobos have the advantage that you can just put in a different SD card if you mess up


[10/27/2023 6:20 PM] zoli111
Yeah, you are probably right


[10/27/2023 6:21 PM] zoli111

Electromechanical Refreshable Braille Module : HackadayPrize 2023
The big drawback to refreshable braille devices has always been their cost. The loose rule of estimation applied to these products has translated into something like $100 to $150 per braille cell. A 40-cell display, in other words, may cost $4,000 to $6,000, while an 80-cell model will cost $8,000 to $12,000. And so it has been that, while desir...

Hello! I've installed InkBox on my Kobo Mini and i would like to use it as a small dashboard for my home assistant instance. Looking at the wiki i can see i could just kill the ibkbox gui and use `fbi` to draw on the framebuffer. However, I'm not 100% sure how to connect reliably to the ebook - since it looks like with inkbox the wifi connection drops frequently


[11/6/2023 8:24 PM] [matrix] foxo (@foxo:foxo.me)
Also, is there a way to enable boot flags without disassembling the device?


[11/6/2023 8:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
wifi on kobo mini is not reliable


[11/6/2023 8:37 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and we dont have this device now so someone else needs to fix that


[11/6/2023 8:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
as for other questions

you can, better to use fbink for that, or just qt like a normal human being ;)
yes, you need to root the device and via shell for example


[11/6/2023 8:43 PM] andi15701
which wifi chip does it have?


[11/6/2023 8:46 PM] szybet
its propably a inkbox issue


[11/6/2023 9:17 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] foxo 
Oh damn fbink looks really nice


[11/6/2023 9:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
gui app can only exit itself, there is no kill switch, you need to implement it


[11/6/2023 9:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so its just like killing inkbox gui


[11/6/2023 9:44 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the only diffrence is that on reboot inkbox launches and you have access to the wifi manager


[11/6/2023 9:44 PM] [matrix] Szybet
if thats not what you want, you need to replace inkbox.sh with your script that will connect to wifi via cli


[11/6/2023 9:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
gui apps can also eassly be shared with other users and updated, reproduced


[11/6/2023 9:53 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] tux-linux 
They can be killed


[11/6/2023 9:55 PM] [matrix] Szybet
they can but nothing does it


[11/6/2023 9:56 PM] [matrix] Szybet
\+ if the app crashes inkbox launches, so a fail safe

oh ok

Hi
C is not the default, it was not the first model ported so it always will be the "second one" as in codebase and releases, so it stays like that. a user needs to read the wiki / github issue and choose anyway. Well maybe a better wiki page could be handy...

personally id just have a dislaimer and a dl file like N306-4C1

Hello, I got a tolino shine 2 that I flashed the N613 (the kobo glo one which is the equivalent) inkbox image on but it doesn't find any of the epubs that I've transferred onto it and it doesn't show any books downloaded from the online library. I've tried restarting and  resetting it several times is there anything besides reflashing the sd or using a different sd card that I can try?

is it normal for a kobo to make noise while powered on


[11/13/2023 12:27 PM] ewired
it's not correlated with the front light, I still hear it when the front light is completely off


[11/13/2023 12:28 PM] ewired
though the front light is starting to flicker a bit in one corner

[11/13/2023 6:55 PM] ewired
the front light in a certain corner is flickering a bit at like 10-60% brightness, the same corner where there is a gradient that loses the warm color tone, the gradient was always there but maybe not the flicker, I can't tell if I'm just tripping and it has always been that way


[11/13/2023 7:13 PM] szybet
dead led


[11/13/2023 7:39 PM] ewired
10% brightness is low enough for it to be gone or at least not notice it, this is what I get for buying "open box"

I will continue buying a new kobo every 6 months until they stop getting destroyed by me or coming pre-destroyed, when I get a new device I will sacrifice this libra 2 to trying to get inkbox working on it

is it just because of a monopoly from patents or does eink really cost a lot to produce?

thats why android eink ereaders suck if they are as cheap as the linux ones - to make the price the same, the hardware is then underpowered for android


[11/13/2023 7:54 PM] szybet
nothing costs much if its manufactured on a large scale: semiconductors for example.

so yes, eink is a monopoly and it sucks

there are really cheap small eink screens used in supermarkets for labeling. they cost almost nothing because there is mass production of this model.

[11/13/2023 8:23 PM] szybet
its not cpu its a coil being driven wrong, or wrong frequency on it, or tolerances of components went wrong and frequency problem.

very weird for a low power device. maybe its related to the brightness flickering, like a voltage line is not stable

it sounds like my laptop when I plug it into a certain third-party power adapter

i know this sound, in electronics only coils do that "normally" without burning the device

now I'm worried about what I'm charging the battery with, though it seems like it's the battery's problem if the noise is happening still while not plugged in

the noise is there no matter what charger I plug it into


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] szybet
dont worry, devices for the most part have protection on both sides, and the charging circuit and the battery. Kobo has both

you can find on #dev where i explored a dead kobo, the PMIC died ( the charging, power circuit ) so the battery applied many times short circuit protection - the battery is still fine


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] szybet
you can try to flood all coils on your kobo with epoxy, it should minimase the noise a bit


[11/13/2023 8:29 PM] ewired
yeah the coil whine would be fine if it weren't for the frontlight flicker

Nia Resurrecting a bricked kobo nia! Kobo Reader

I do not remember your issue, can you say it once again?


[12/10/2023 6:30 PM] ihave452toasters
it began when I was trying to upgrade my Kobo's storage from 8 GB -> 32 GB by swapping the SD card as a friend of mine had done.
removed the SD card and copied the partitions onto a 32 GB card, and removed all the unallocated space.  then when i reinstalled everything on the 32 GB card. It would not boot, so I extended the unallocated space from the factory card and reinstalled it. This created the same result and bricked the Kobo


[12/10/2023 6:31 PM] [matrix] Szybet
which os was used where


[12/10/2023 6:31 PM] ihave452toasters
then i installed a nickel os from the forum but it was the version with the wrong pmic


[12/10/2023 6:31 PM] ihave452toasters
this is all nickel


[12/10/2023 6:33 PM] ihave452toasters
so what id need is the factory kobo nia model c image


[12/10/2023 6:35 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so you dont like inkbox


[12/10/2023 6:36 PM] ihave452toasters
i do like it, however im having massive reliablity and performance issues


[12/10/2023 6:36 PM] [matrix] Szybet
have you turned off xorg


[12/10/2023 6:37 PM] ihave452toasters
no i havent


[12/10/2023 6:37 PM] [matrix] Szybet
then do it


[12/10/2023 6:37 PM] ihave452toasters
i used it as is out of box, and didnt run dark mode


[12/10/2023 6:37 PM] ihave452toasters
how do i go about i ?

[12/10/2023 6:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i have a problematic access to a kobo nia model c and i could retrieve the image but the reality is i dont have time


[12/10/2023 6:44 PM] ihave452toasters
fair enough, i understand. you foss devs are doing angels work


[12/10/2023 6:44 PM] ihave452toasters
finding my kobo now lol


[12/10/2023 6:54 PM] ihave452toasters
there is no xorg setting, howeve ri have disabled xorg and its pretty normal id say now in performance

[12/10/2023 8:13 PM] kuratius
if you did exactly what you said here (remove *all* unallocated space)


[12/10/2023 8:13 PM] kuratius
then you probably removed the boot partition


[12/10/2023 8:13 PM] kuratius
with waveform information  and uboot etc


[12/10/2023 8:14 PM] kuratius
you can only use the unallocated space towards the end of the sd card


[12/10/2023 8:14 PM] kuratius
if you extend it towards the beginning you delete the information it needs to boot


[12/10/2023 8:16 PM] kuratius
basically, there's two unallocated sections


[12/10/2023 8:17 PM] kuratius
the smaller one is actually important

As in writing a new firmware for the watchy
https://watchy.sqfmi.com/
I wonder what cool integration features could I add to inkbox with the watch, apart from changing pages from the watch, as i plan it already

[12/22/2023 12:15 PM] [matrix] Szybet
We could brand that firmware with inkbox or smth, like integrate it more into this project


[12/22/2023 8:16 PM] kuratius
control audio playback


[12/22/2023 8:16 PM] kuratius
assuming you have wireless headphones


[12/22/2023 8:16 PM] kuratius
like, your ereader could be in your backback


[12/22/2023 8:17 PM] kuratius
and you could be using bluetooth headphones/earplugs


[12/22/2023 8:17 PM] kuratius
though that's still strictly inferior to just using a smartwatch


[12/22/2023 8:42 PM] szybet
then i would use my phone for that


[12/22/2023 8:43 PM] szybet
my ereader has wireless headphones, so no point in that


[12/22/2023 8:44 PM] kuratius
then there isnt a good integration for this with your ereader


[12/22/2023 8:44 PM] szybet
i mean when i listen to music on my ereader i use the ereader


[12/22/2023 8:44 PM] kuratius
I mean more like you being able to use the watch to change tracks


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] kuratius
not the watch playing the song itself


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] kuratius
it'd still be played from the ereader


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
.


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] szybet
i use my phone for listening to music most of the time soo


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] kuratius
then you dont really have a use for it


[12/22/2023 8:45 PM] kuratius
like I said


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] szybet
for the ereader or the watch?


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] kuratius
you want your watch to either control some function or to display some kind of information


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] kuratius
what information is there that it cant already display on its own?


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] kuratius
for integrating the watch with your ereader


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] kuratius
that was your question


[12/22/2023 8:46 PM] szybet
changing 2 menus is not the problem


[12/22/2023 8:47 PM] szybet
but changing pages with the watchy would allow me to read while the ereader is far away from me, in bed for example


[12/22/2023 8:47 PM] szybet
like on the bed table


[12/22/2023 8:47 PM] kuratius
same for wireless headphones


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
like if you have it in your backpack playing music via bluetooth


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] szybet
then its for my phone


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
I dislike touch controls on earphones for the most part, so physical buttons on the watch would be better


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
you can use the watch to control your phone instead


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
if you really wanted


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
but it's not that useful


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] kuratius
because the phone is not as big as the ereader


[12/22/2023 8:48 PM] szybet
i will add it, but i im asking for the ereader for now


[12/22/2023 8:49 PM] kuratius
so just taking the phone out may be more convenient


[12/22/2023 8:49 PM] szybet
not really but yes, i get your point


[12/22/2023 8:49 PM] kuratius
could do anki on the watch?


[12/22/2023 8:49 PM] kuratius
idk depends on card size


[12/22/2023 8:50 PM] kuratius
text size I mean


[12/22/2023 8:50 PM] kuratius
although storage could also be a concern


[12/22/2023 8:50 PM] szybet
not that usefull


[12/22/2023 8:50 PM] szybet
nah, flash size is big


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] kuratius
I'm kind of grasping at straws here


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
i will read books on the watchy


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
thats my main point


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] kuratius
smartwatches dont really do anything your phone doesnt already do


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] kuratius
so idk what use they are, really


[12/22/2023 8:51 PM] szybet
this one is special, it has eink and can do anything you want


[12/22/2023 8:52 PM] szybet
i will display weather data that i gather via a free api, that is better than any weather app and will save it for offline use, for free


[12/22/2023 8:52 PM] szybet
and read books on the bus by just moving my arm, holding your phone in a standing position in front of you is tiring

its running on rpi so its not even arduino framework

Hello. I came to check on the porting process for the Clara 2e. If at some point there’s development happening on that, I may be willing to help test or contribute if I can.


[12/25/2023 9:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nope, no one touched it


[12/25/2023 9:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you need to port it yourself


[12/25/2023 9:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
we can help bla bla bla


[12/25/2023 9:22 PM] tux_linux
.


[12/25/2023 9:26 PM] bamboo_1758
I figured as much.
1. Yes
2. At a very irregular schedule.
3. We’ll find out
4. Yes, I have an Arduino.


[12/25/2023 9:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
arduino uno pin voltage is 5, which too big for the clara cpu

5V UART adapters worked for all other devices, but no one tryied for the 2E so its 5% chance it will burn


[12/25/2023 9:28 PM] bamboo_1758
I am willing to work on porting, but as I said, I’ll only have time on a very intermittent schedule.


[12/25/2023 9:29 PM] bamboo_1758
I have an RPI as well if that’d work better.


[12/25/2023 9:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
ye will do


[12/25/2023 9:47 PM] tux_linux
normally for kobo you dont need the 5v or 3v3 input


[12/25/2023 9:47 PM] tux_linux
battery makes up for that


[12/25/2023 9:48 PM] tux_linux
so just tx+rx+gnd should be fine

should

should

rpi is reliable tho


[12/25/2023 9:49 PM] bamboo_1758
Great. I will return in something like a month to begin. The device is new, so I’ll get some use out of it first before I begin to hack on it.

[12/26/2023 1:40 AM] tux_linux

InkBox OS emulator
This uses the vexpress-a9 ARM board emulated in QEMU. Graphics and input are handled by the libqvnc.so library, which allows one to interact with the UI with a VNC viewer.

[12/26/2023 1:48 AM] tux_linux
maybe you should get an older one that's already supported?


[12/26/2023 1:48 AM] tux_linux
glo hd or nia are probably the best picks


[12/26/2023 1:48 AM] tux_linux
glo **hd**


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
well, as you like


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
@TheLinuxPirate also wanted to do some clara hd work


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
although you could help with testing new clara hd model


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
because there seems to be variations


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
there is the Clara HD A and the Clara HD B


[12/26/2023 1:51 AM] tux_linux
i think there's a different pmic in it or something


[12/26/2023 1:53 AM] tux_linux
well, its probably more difficult


[12/26/2023 1:54 AM] tux_linux
it's as you want


[12/26/2023 4:53 PM] thelinuxpirate
I got lucky and got the older model Clara HD blind-buying on Amazon. 

I thought I read the other model will fry itself if you attempt to boot the mainline kernel on it, but that may have been postmarketos.

What's worse is that Furigana doesnt work either 😦

Only project I know of that supports Furigana is koreader. Iirc there is a koreader build for inkbox so you can just use that I think.

I think vertical text is only implemented in the stock nickel reader.


[12/27/2023 12:06 AM] szybet
let's play a game of "how many japanese readers are out there complaining it's not supported instead of implementing it"

plato has the same bug 😢


[12/27/2023 12:11 AM] kuratius
basically ruby tags arent implemented


[12/27/2023 12:12 AM] kuratius
so the parser ignores them and vomits it where it shouldnt be


[12/27/2023 12:13 AM] kuratius
\overset would work for this purpose in latex
and there are compact latex renderers that support overset + text


[12/27/2023 12:13 AM] kuratius
so that could be a workaround, but you'd need implement linebreaking and whatnot first


[12/27/2023 12:14 AM] kuratius
since the latex projects I saw that are standalone dont have that many features

Just installed KoReader. Is it correct, that I have to copy my books to the app-data folder to access it?
Furthermore, right now I have the problem that KoReader is not saving the current settings (like changing language). After exiting KoReader, it is set to english again. Any chance to keep the settings?


[12/28/2023 2:59 PM] szybet
yes - if you dont want in app-data, then you need to update the rootfs

Oh
It's a bug with my port of koreader - you need to figure out how to tell koreader where to save the settings ( I thought It worked ) then I can create a new app package
I dont have time to do this soo

- Is there a porting guide? I'm an embedded/Linux engineer in my day job (working mostly with NVIDIA Tegras, Rockchips, and some Amlogic chips) and am looking to port InkBox to my Clara 2E
- Is there a way to run "user apps" on InkBox? ie. if I want to write a WireGuard UI so I may use a VPN, or a UI to sync with my homelab

Hi everyone, sorry for bothering with question but does anyone have a Kobo Nia in order to compare my experience?
I'll explain myself better: I installed and (after a bit of trouble resizing the SD) everything was working but... It's "laggy"...

I mean, I don't care about the fact that it's slow (I only have to read on it, so speed is not necessary), what I mean is that quite often menus don't load well (elements from previous rendered page are overlapping with the new page) and for example KoReader don't boot straight up.

I'm aware of this issue: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/issues/47
but I have a +4A2 serial number.

I'm asking this just to know if something is wrong with my device or simply the Nia isn't powerful enough and I will have to change device to get a better experience.

So, just to know, Xorg isn't the main display server? I guess then than it's used for custom apps like Qt ones?


[1/6/2024 10:25 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
And also, by disabling Xorg you mean KoBox right?


[1/6/2024 10:25 PM] [matrix] Szybet
its the opposite

qt has its own faster and better way of displaying things and xorg is weird slow buggy and hell with him

yes, kobox


[1/6/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
So is Qt the DS rn?


[1/6/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
there is no ds server in a linux way


[1/6/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
qt has platform plugins, and those are attached to apps as "libraries" and they display to xorg, or wayland, or directly to the screen in our example


[1/6/2024 10:29 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] haitam-kenwai 
Didn't know that


[1/6/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Cool


[1/6/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Thanks for the explanation


[1/6/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
I rarely use Qt apps (and never developed in it)


[1/6/2024 10:33 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Ok, now everything seems better


[1/6/2024 10:34 PM] [matrix] haitam-kenwai
Does disabling KoBox prevent me from doing something?

Make sense


[1/6/2024 11:04 PM] marzagheddon
I'm trying to open a .epub and it freezes the device... And my microsd is pretty good


[1/6/2024 11:04 PM] [matrix] Szybet
koreader?


[1/6/2024 11:04 PM] kuratius
known issue with koreader


[1/6/2024 11:05 PM] kuratius
I had my nia freeze for 20 min trying to prerender a Japanese book


[1/6/2024 11:07 PM] kuratius
it renders the entire book on first open, with no way to abort the process


[1/6/2024 11:07 PM] kuratius
instead of, say, the first page


[1/6/2024 11:07 PM] kuratius
in exchange subsequent openings are relatively fast


[1/6/2024 11:07 PM] marzagheddon
Also, now it opened but if i have a big font all the pages are cut.
And i can't scroll them


[1/6/2024 11:08 PM] kuratius
what reader?


[1/6/2024 11:08 PM] tux_linux
hehe we do that too


[1/6/2024 11:09 PM] marzagheddon
Kobo n905


[1/6/2024 11:10 PM] kuratius
and did you use koreader or the built in reader?


[1/6/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
soon not


[1/6/2024 11:11 PM] marzagheddon
Built in i guess. I clicked reader and then the book


[1/6/2024 11:11 PM] kuratius
prerendering isnt too bad, if there is an abort button and a way to tell progress


[1/6/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
use koreader, this one is shitty


[1/6/2024 11:12 PM] tux_linux
why


[1/6/2024 11:12 PM] tux_linux
didnt you change it


[1/6/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
mine doesnt do that


[1/6/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
but i dont have time to finish it


[1/6/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
so soon is 6 months


[1/6/2024 11:13 PM] tux_linux
so it unzips the book every time?


[1/6/2024 11:13 PM] tux_linux
no more instant page loading?


[1/6/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
directly uses the zip via mupdf


[1/6/2024 11:14 PM] szybet
are you \*\*\*\*\*\*\* serious, i showed you a few demos already and its faster already


[1/6/2024 11:14 PM] tux_linux
ok, that too was 6mo ago


[1/6/2024 11:15 PM] tux_linux
and iirc you said it still wasn't great because it couldn't split pages perfectly


[1/6/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
"couldn't perfectly" is better than what is now, now its chaos


[1/6/2024 11:17 PM] marzagheddon
How to open with koreader?


[1/6/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
install it


[1/6/2024 11:18 PM] tux_linux
does koreader work with 2.0 release or does it need git updates


[1/6/2024 11:18 PM] marzagheddon
Damn this is hard lol

[1/6/2024 11:20 PM] szybet
you need to put books inside app data, apart from that sometimes time and brightness can die inside of koreader, apart from that its fine


[1/6/2024 11:20 PM] tux_linux
ok

[1/6/2024 11:21 PM] marzagheddon
Damn, i'll try tomorrow, after some good sleep


[1/7/2024 11:17 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
Just discovered inkbox, so excited! Trying to determine which kobo reader has the most ram and is supported, am I correct that it's the Kobo Libra H2O aka N873?


[1/7/2024 11:18 PM] tux_linux
i think you should choose the glo hd instead
it's less complicated to install inkbox on it


[1/7/2024 11:18 PM] tux_linux
it has 512mb ram too


[1/7/2024 11:19 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
Thank you, I do like the higher ppi on the libra, although not that important, and unless I read wrong the microsd is removable on the Libra but you have to replace the waterproofing, I like that there is some waterproofing, but again not show stopper. Is it really that much easier?


[1/7/2024 11:20 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nice nick


[1/7/2024 11:20 PM] [matrix] Szybet
as you named yourself so, do you know the watchy?


[1/7/2024 11:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the epaper watch


[1/7/2024 11:22 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I've read about it, I had the pebble watch which is transflective lcd and now I have a garmin with similiar b/w screen. my watch battery needs to last at least a week!


[1/7/2024 11:22 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I have a hisense eink phone which is killer, but tons of chinese bloatware and I still dont trust it even though it is rooted and firewalled

cool


[1/7/2024 11:25 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:matrix.org) 
is it just removing the sd card that is more difficult?


[1/7/2024 11:25 PM] tux_linux
no


[1/7/2024 11:25 PM] tux_linux
there is no sd card in libra


[1/7/2024 11:25 PM] tux_linux
so you have to install manually over serial


[1/7/2024 11:26 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
ahh okay that is very good to know. I don't want a headache so this is very good advice


[1/7/2024 11:26 PM] [matrix] Szybet
\+ there is a risk of bricking it to the state only a skilled developer / electrician could fix it


[1/7/2024 11:26 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so glo


[1/7/2024 11:26 PM] [matrix] Szybet
or the nia if you want to go cheaper


[1/7/2024 11:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also, inkbox os is not perfect, its usable


[1/7/2024 11:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
just for you to be aware


[1/7/2024 11:27 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
nia I was concerned since there are different versions that may not work, don't want to order wrong one. and less ram


[1/7/2024 11:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
both work


[1/7/2024 11:28 PM] [matrix] Szybet
on one its less supported but it works


[1/7/2024 11:28 PM] tux_linux
glo hd
otherwise you will get 212ppi and 256mb ram

ahh the glo hd I couldn't find the ram, so it is 512?


[1/7/2024 11:32 PM] tux_linux
glo hd : 300 ppi and 512 mb ram
glo : 212 ppi and 256 mb ram


[1/7/2024 11:32 PM] [matrix] Szybet
glo hd can be only bought used


[1/7/2024 11:33 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
yes I used a mini for a long time because it was the smallest ereader I could find, had to stop when it started getting difficult to find used ones


[1/7/2024 11:33 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
ok thank you guys so much I am so glad I came to ask, the glo hd sounds perfect


[1/7/2024 11:33 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I know some discussion is elsewhere but how many hours of reading do people get ballpark, is it much less than stock software? and does it use much energy when off/in sleep?


[1/7/2024 11:34 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I also just discovered KOBOX, which allows a browser, but this is for stock software right?


[1/7/2024 11:34 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I am really hoping I can get some note taking app to take nots while I read, I couldn't find if copy and paste was availabile


[1/7/2024 11:35 PM] tux_linux
did you know inkbox supports mini


[1/7/2024 11:36 PM] tux_linux
we dont care about battery optimization
to sum it up


[1/7/2024 11:36 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
yes I did, which is nice since kobo no longer supports the mini I believe


[1/7/2024 11:36 PM] tux_linux
first we would like the system to be actually usable


[1/7/2024 11:36 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
at least in sleep we do, when its sleeping the battery life doesnt drop much at all


[1/7/2024 11:36 PM] tux_linux
especially the reader part, which for the moment is not so great


[1/7/2024 11:37 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
we have koreader as a replacement for that


[1/7/2024 11:37 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
koreader can run on inkbox? forgive the stupid questions I know I can find answer, I really appreciate your expertise


[1/7/2024 11:37 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it can, we have many native apps


[1/7/2024 11:37 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and xorg apps are experimental and slow soo keep that in mind


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
nevermind I saw the app list


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] tux_linux
glo hd is one of the best models for kobox


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] tux_linux
well, apart from some strange fbdepth bug that happens sometimes


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
yes I want the 512ram so I can experiment with xorg apps


[1/7/2024 11:38 PM] tux_linux
don't count too much on xorg tho


[1/7/2024 11:39 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
no, primarily I want to read books without having every page turn sent to some conglomerate


[1/7/2024 11:39 PM] [matrix] Szybet
koreader can do that ;p


[1/7/2024 11:40 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I wonder if koreader app on stock softare is enough to minimize the trracking, but I imagine its technically possible for kobo to see what books I have installed if they wanted to with their software


[1/7/2024 11:41 PM] [matrix] Szybet
on stock firmware it can reset itself often and randomly on updates or randomly if using other apps, which deletes all your data


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and they show you adds obviously


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] Szybet
of books they sell


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
yes this is not an option for me


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
so inkbox is my only option


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I also have considered the remarkable tablet, but it is expensive


[1/7/2024 11:42 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
do you know if the glo hd supports otg keyboard?


[1/7/2024 11:43 PM] tux_linux
not tested


[1/7/2024 11:43 PM] tux_linux
probably some hassle


[1/7/2024 11:43 PM] tux_linux
idk


[1/7/2024 11:43 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it should?, and inkbox supports usb keyboard, even a mouse in some places, with hot plugging! ( at least on the nia model A ) https://github.com/Szybet/niAudio/tree/main/keyboard

its the most advanced eink-usb keyboard open source setup available


[1/7/2024 11:50 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
now I am torn, but I think I will enjoy the ram more than the keyboard, hard to say


[1/7/2024 11:50 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you can tinker yourself to make it work


[1/7/2024 11:50 PM] [matrix] Szybet
also you would need the nia model A to make it work oob


[1/7/2024 11:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and a special cable


[1/7/2024 11:51 PM] tux_linux
it would be good to have otg support on another device too


[1/7/2024 11:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and some modified software in addition to inkbox because it would be dangerous to add it to the stock


[1/7/2024 11:52 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I may not be the best candidate, I am a researcher so reading is a higher priority than tinkering unfortunately

[1/7/2024 11:57 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
haha


[1/7/2024 11:57 PM] [matrix] Szybet
propably is 30% here


[1/7/2024 11:57 PM] tux_linux
it was nuclear-proofed before 2.0 release


[1/7/2024 11:57 PM] tux_linux
so yes


[1/7/2024 11:57 PM] tux_linux
but it causes some issues with local library
so you have to open your books by searching them

last I could find no copy pasting in koreader, is there any way to copy paste selections from a book into a notes app (like feather notes, thank you szybet!)


[1/8/2024 12:11 AM] [matrix] Szybet
feather notes needs usb keyboard

we dont support multi apps because of hardware limitations


[1/8/2024 12:11 AM] [matrix] Szybet
so you sadly wont be able to use them at the same time

Release InkBox 2.0 · Kobo-InkBox/inkbox
Biggest release of InkBox OS ever. Yes, the time gap between 1.9 and 2.0 is huge, but we hope you will find that it was worth it.
Thanks to @Szybet for greatly contributing to the project, now for ...

sorry to bother youy


[1/8/2024 8:59 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
another question I will be able to answer on my own soon enough, apologies: inkbox supports the warm frontlight? and does it allow the lighting to go below stock minimum? havent used a kobo recently but minimum always too bright


[1/8/2024 8:59 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/8/2024 8:59 PM] tux_linux
no


[1/8/2024 9:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
hardware limited


[1/8/2024 9:00 PM] tux_linux
i find the libra's frontlight pretty fine


[1/8/2024 9:00 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/8/2024 9:00 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you can use dark mode to make it darker


[1/8/2024 9:01 PM] tux_linux
in the future


[1/8/2024 9:01 PM] [matrix] Szybet
it works in koreader


[1/8/2024 9:01 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and in sanki


[1/8/2024 9:01 PM] tux_linux
well, yes, there


[1/8/2024 10:02 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
thank you


[1/8/2024 10:03 PM] tux_linux
np


[1/8/2024 10:03 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
and sending web pages or articles to read on the device what do you guys use? export on pc and syncthing?


[1/8/2024 10:03 PM] tux_linux
i dont read web pages on my ereader
but maybe you can export them to pdf
ask szybet, i think he uses syncthing


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
exactly


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] Szybet
web pages to epub


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] Szybet
many ways to do that


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] Szybet
cool as hell


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] Szybet
syncthing syncs it in a few seconds


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
yes i love epub, love when open standards win


[1/8/2024 10:06 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
thank you this is what I will do


[1/8/2024 10:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
i think you will need to update rootfs for that


[1/8/2024 10:07 PM] [matrix] Szybet
to be able for syncthing to use the main storage instead of only app storage


[1/8/2024 10:08 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nicolas, can you please prepare rootfs for him? update gui apps and ipd, this is the most important part


[1/8/2024 10:08 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
cant you move from app storage manually on the device afterwards?


[1/8/2024 10:09 PM] [matrix] Szybet
only with ssh


[1/8/2024 10:09 PM] [matrix] Szybet
so, no


[1/8/2024 10:10 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
hm ok thank you


[1/8/2024 10:10 PM] tux_linux
you can move it from usbms


[1/8/2024 10:10 PM] tux_linux
no? @Szybet


[1/8/2024 10:10 PM] [matrix] Szybet
nicolas should find time to provide you with this small partial update


[1/8/2024 10:10 PM] tux_linux
will you buy a libra


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] tux_linux
if so we can install the last development version right from the trunk


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
i will buy glo hd


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what? i dont understand


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] [matrix] Szybet
oh


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] tux_linux
why did you ask for warm light then


[1/8/2024 10:11 PM] tux_linux
glo hd hasn't any


[1/8/2024 10:12 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m

[1/8/2024 10:13 PM] tux_linux
yes
youre looking at libra 2, not libra


[1/8/2024 10:13 PM] tux_linux
libra has an easier to replace sd card


[1/8/2024 10:13 PM] tux_linux
i think it isnt coated

at least i don't remember it being coated on mine

Is the light of your Kobo Glo backlight too bright? No worries! You can replace the LEDs of the backlight. Be warned though: It's not easy.

yes I misspoke these two mods actually replace the LED

what a madmap manually soldering those

well yea i dont have time for that


[1/8/2024 10:17 PM] tux_linux
maybe you can put an orange filter on the screen itself


[1/8/2024 10:17 PM] tux_linux
just an idea


[1/8/2024 10:18 PM] tux_linux
probably will work like crap

not a bad idea

so I either have 512mb ram and no warm light, or 256 and warm light or the libra h2O with both but cant remove the sd card


[1/8/2024 10:19 PM] tux_linux
what model has 256mb and warm light


[1/8/2024 10:20 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I thought only two had 512 and was assuming


[1/8/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
clara hd has 512mb and warm light


[1/8/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
probably not your best option right now


[1/8/2024 10:21 PM] [matrix] Szybet
inkbox doesnt work on it


[1/8/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
false


[1/8/2024 10:21 PM] tux_linux
it works


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
but slower than on some 256m devices


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
true

[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
the display is too slow because kernel issues


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] [matrix] Szybet
compared to all other devices


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
well, yea, fb rendering is a kernel issue


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
this sounds not fun to use


[1/8/2024 10:22 PM] tux_linux
its borderline usable


[1/8/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
enough to get a beta image out


[1/8/2024 10:23 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
is there a 256 device that is the fastest??


[1/8/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
and hope someone finds a fix


[1/8/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
i wouldnt vouch on 256mb devices


[1/8/2024 10:23 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
i expect to do pdf reflow in koreader and that needs ram


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
i suggest libra h2o
also, with that device you can hard brick it and recover easily even there


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
@andi knows a bit about it


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
he had a broken screen one, he just wiped everything on the emmc and was still able to load a bootloader afterwards


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] tux_linux
via usb


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
thats not so easy


[1/8/2024 10:24 PM] [matrix] Szybet
stop


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux
well, if you have enough will


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
if its possible over usb thats not so bad


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
what are the odds I break it???


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux
and brick is probably not something that will happen in the first place


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux
if you follow instructions, probably very slim

nicolas doesnt know the full picture and is wrong


[1/8/2024 10:25 PM] tux_linux

i do boot my libra over usb


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
and flashing inkbox possible over usb?


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] tux_linux
i did recover from a broken kernel over usb


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] tux_linux
i know the full picture


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
on the h2O i mean


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] tux_linux
yes
but manually


[1/8/2024 10:26 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
i dont have time to explain but polease dont recommend eemc devices to people that are not ready to cut traces and reconnect them when the device is on. thanks


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] tux_linux
well, he seems ready to do whatever hacking is needed


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
kernel haha easy


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
what about broken bootloader?


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] tux_linux
you just throw it a new u-boot via uuu


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
even you arent ready for that, stop


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] tux_linux
over usb


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] [matrix] Szybet
epaperboi: dont buy eemc devices for real


[1/8/2024 10:27 PM] tux_linux
what


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
ok I dont want to get stuck fixing it so I wont


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
so glo hd still my best bet for 512


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] tux_linux
probably then


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] andi15701
it is no problem to *erase* the bootloader and then recover on the kobos, but if you write a bad bootloader, things can become hard


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] andi15701
and having a bigger sd is also nice


[1/8/2024 10:28 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
if the bootloader is broken but the cpu doesnt detect that, you cant do anything


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] tux_linux
yes


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] tux_linux
true


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] epaperboi (@epaperboi:m
I think covering the LEDs in orange plastic is easier haha


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
you have awaken andi you see? stop spreading misinformation ;p


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] tux_linux
but isnt there a way to short the mmc and force it to boot a working bootloader via usb?


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] tux_linux
probably hard from technical standpoint


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
cutting traces


[1/8/2024 10:29 PM] [matrix] Szybet
and not shorting


[1/8/2024 10:30 PM] andi15701
if there are test points...


[1/8/2024 10:30 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet 
find the trace, diagnose the trace, cut it and connect it when the device is on and dont short anything else

yea, lol

lots of discussion of this project it might be useful to have a "recommended hardware" section on the wiki

I managed to to something like that on the BT200


[1/8/2024 10:30 PM] tux_linux
well, libra h2o literally isnt recommended anywhere

i was just saying someone succeeded in doing something like that before
i know its hard

well, i couldnt access a prompt


[1/8/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux
this one used imx_usb_downloader


[1/8/2024 10:35 PM] andi15701
probably same as uuu


[1/8/2024 10:35 PM] andi15701
conceptually


[1/8/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux
and you could boot u-boots even if one was not working
Before the actual u-boot would start


[1/8/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux
probably
just a bit older


[1/8/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux
you had to long press the power button before even anything would start


[1/8/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux
and it would export itself over usb


[1/8/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux
SE BLANK MEGREZ or smth like that


[1/8/2024 10:36 PM] andi15701
if the boot order is usb, then emmc or something


[1/8/2024 10:36 PM] andi15701
the same might appears on empty emmc

maybe I should wait for the clara HD and have it all.... lol


[1/8/2024 10:37 PM] tux_linux
but coming back to the libra, i think i never had to write a new u-boot to it


[1/8/2024 10:38 PM] tux_linux
when andi sent test 2020.10 u-boots, i loaded them over usb


[1/8/2024 10:38 PM] tux_linux
i think mine is still running the original


[1/8/2024 10:38 PM] tux_linux
the only thing I changed were the boot commands
but if you brick it there it's probably very easy to fix it up


[1/8/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
at best, a reflash from userspace of the env vars
at worse, some commands in u-boot command line via serial port


[1/8/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
so it's yours to choose
but there is no harm done to the bootloader in inkbox install process, as far as I recall


[1/8/2024 10:43 PM] tux_linux
if you want a reasonably simple device, then the glo hd is the way to go even though its 9yo


[1/8/2024 10:43 PM] tux_linux
ereader specs dont really change over time


[1/8/2024 10:43 PM] tux_linux
the glo hd's screen is better than the clara's, to give you an idea
at least better than my clara


[1/8/2024 10:44 PM] andi15701
what might be interesting is the clara2e


[1/8/2024 10:44 PM] andi15701
because of bluetooth

[1/8/2024 10:44 PM] tux_linux
i bought the libra 2 yesterday


[1/8/2024 10:44 PM] tux_linux
also has bluetooth


[1/8/2024 10:45 PM] andi15701
I have the clara2e and did not manage to remove the sd card yet


[1/8/2024 10:45 PM] tux_linux
probably that a cross-device bluetooth handler can be written


[1/8/2024 10:45 PM] tux_linux
is it coated


[1/8/2024 10:45 PM] andi15701
yes, it is tricky but should not be without chance


[1/8/2024 10:46 PM] andi15701
there is some 5.10 kernel for the 2e


[1/8/2024 10:46 PM] tux_linux
did you look at the guy who removed it in his libra 2

he has some advice


[1/8/2024 10:46 PM] tux_linux
you can probably get away with ums via u-boot on the clara 2e i presume though?


[1/8/2024 10:47 PM] andi15701
well, need more storage


[1/8/2024 10:47 PM] tux_linux
hm


[1/8/2024 10:47 PM] tux_linux
then yea, removing it is better


[1/8/2024 10:47 PM] andi15701
for testing, yes


[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] andi15701
so I would first try to do any porting steps

[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] tux_linux
we also once thought of making inkbox boot from a nfs rootfs over usbnet
probably a bit far fetched


[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] andi15701
and upstream stuff to the kernel


[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] tux_linux
porting inkbox or porting the kernel?


[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] andi15701
porting the kernel


[1/8/2024 10:48 PM] tux_linux
hm


[1/8/2024 10:49 PM] andi15701
and then doing risky stuff


[1/8/2024 10:49 PM] andi15701
like removing the card


[1/8/2024 10:49 PM] tux_linux
yea


[1/8/2024 10:49 PM] tux_linux
maybe you could use an otg usb adapter and somehow make it work with an external drive or smth


[1/8/2024 10:49 PM] tux_linux
or sd card


[1/8/2024 10:50 PM] andi15701

something general about emmc boot and broken bootloaders: if there is a hw mechanism to change boot order (like the pin needed it wired to some key), then you have an easy game, some devices  have that, others not

it's so strange seeing koreader run on inkbox, hadn't installed it before
it's awesome
but also sad


[1/10/2024 4:37 AM] tux_linux
well, after all, maybe the reader isn't necessarily the most important piece of software
we are providing an entire open-source os, tons of features and everything else
so I guess using koreader would just be as if you installed it on nickel, to replace a technically-usable-but-not-so-great reader


[1/10/2024 4:45 AM] tux_linux
you can even download wikipedia articles

just install koreader on it

in inkbox
with n613 image?

what

Pardon the intrusion, but it would be wise to make a dd iso backup of the included SD card and then flash inkbox onto the 64gb card, yeah?

I see that the Kobo nia (N306) has 2 inkbox images (306a and 306c), how do I know which one applies to mine?

The second image is a serial port, yes you can listen to boot messages and diagnose problems, but unless you are porting to a new device or debugging uboot it's not useful to you


[1/14/2024 4:54 AM] kuratius
You can set up terminal access via SSH way easier


[1/14/2024 4:55 AM] kuratius
Most new nias are C lately

Yours looks like a C


[1/14/2024 4:58 AM] .fullthrottle
Number on the left is all numbers, no A or C

Outer plastic just names it as "N306"

Battery states "2022-11-03", I'm guessing it's a newer one


[1/14/2024 4:59 AM] kuratius
Check the image I sent


[1/14/2024 4:59 AM] kuratius
Call it board revision idk


[1/14/2024 5:00 AM] kuratius
Mine is A and it has A there in the place of C


[1/14/2024 5:00 AM] kuratius
The image I sent is cropped from szybets collection of Nia c photos


[1/14/2024 5:02 AM] kuratius
Surprisingly mine was only made a month before yours lol


[1/14/2024 5:06 AM] .fullthrottle
I guess that settles it, mine is likely a C model

Were I to use an A image, doing a board swap with this first would make it feasible, right?

Hi i am finally trying to install koreader on my kobo


[1/14/2024 11:50 AM] marzagheddon
I have a zip file. I must unzip it in the apps directory, am i right?


[1/14/2024 11:51 AM] marzagheddon
Also I have a feedback to give. If the inkbox reader will never be as good as koreader, why isn't koreader the default one. It would be waaaay more user friendly i guess?


[1/14/2024 11:53 AM] szybet
in a correct way, yes


[1/14/2024 11:54 AM] szybet
~~we~~ I have written a new one that is ready in 60%, koreader is just a replacement until we finish it


[1/14/2024 11:55 AM] marzagheddon
Nice to hear that. Now i'll install and eventually donate if i'm satisfied


[1/14/2024 11:56 AM] szybet
for any problems you need to update ipd and user apps service in rootfs bla bla bla koreader is supported in the latest dev version of inkbox bla bla bla


[1/14/2024 11:57 AM] marzagheddon
And the books must be in the .database directory even if i open them with koreader or is it another directory?


[1/14/2024 11:58 AM] szybet
if you dont update they need to be in .apps-data/koreader


[1/14/2024 11:58 AM] szybet
if you update they can be where they are, koreader will have access


[1/14/2024 11:58 AM] marzagheddon
W8 wat i didn't read this in the wiki, what's ipd


[1/14/2024 11:58 AM] szybet
inkbox power daemon


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] szybet
a fun thingy that manages sleeping


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] marzagheddon
Damn, i'll probably w8 for that new release


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] marzagheddon
I'm not that pro


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] szybet
a bit of linux and help and you could figure out updating it


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] szybet
manually


[1/14/2024 11:59 AM] szybet
next release will be next summer, propably


[1/14/2024 12:00 PM] marzagheddon
W8 if i install now the dev version i get the keylogger too


[1/14/2024 12:01 PM] szybet
bruh that was a joke


[1/14/2024 12:01 PM] marzagheddon
Ah ok lol


[1/14/2024 12:01 PM] marzagheddon
I thought it was a legit keylogger for debugging


[1/14/2024 12:01 PM] szybet
its not a ready yet program that if you accept, will send us data about the version you use because we dont know how many users we have


[1/14/2024 12:02 PM] marzagheddon
So, i have to install the dev version of inkbox. Then the koreader app and then?


[1/14/2024 12:02 PM] szybet
you can install koreader now but there can be issues


[1/14/2024 12:02 PM] szybet
or there can be none


[1/14/2024 12:02 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[1/14/2024 12:08 PM] marzagheddon
Ok, let me try koreader in the current non dev version...


[1/14/2024 12:40 PM] marzagheddon
I don't see the koreader app when i reboot


[1/14/2024 12:42 PM] marzagheddon
When i unzip koreader_inkbox.zip it creates a folder with another folder within with all the files inside.
What should i copy? The first folder, the second folder or the files?


[1/14/2024 1:09 PM] szybet
on #apps is a conversation about that


[1/14/2024 1:17 PM] marzagheddon
Koreader crashes at startup


[1/14/2024 1:17 PM] marzagheddon
So to have it working now i should? Install the dev version of inkbox and do it all again?
Also how to get the dev version


[1/14/2024 1:23 PM] marzagheddon
Also, why just don't make Koreader the default one


[1/14/2024 1:27 PM] szybet
any logs?


[1/14/2024 1:27 PM] szybet
it doesnt integrate well into our software


[1/14/2024 1:27 PM] szybet
and we can create something different


[1/14/2024 1:29 PM] marzagheddon
How to? It displays some crash infos on the display but it's written veeery small


[1/14/2024 1:29 PM] szybet
make a picture and read it out

inkbox propably uses some weird device naming for this model or the model number is not implemented
you can kindly ask @tux-linux to fix that
its just about adding / changing the env variable to match the model

Wifi doesn't seem to work when I press on any of them:

I press on the one corresponding to my wifi (or any other, really) and nothing happens

only the refresh, not/wifi off, bug report, wifi check mark, scrollbar and return button works

Device is a Kobo Nia, how do I go about making it work?

do you click the arrow


[1/15/2024 4:31 AM] tux_linux
oh


[1/15/2024 4:31 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet


[1/15/2024 4:32 AM] tux_linux
theres supposed to be an arrow in the place of the scrollbar


[1/15/2024 4:32 AM] tux_linux
but somehow it isnt there


[1/15/2024 4:32 AM] tux_linux
try getting in a place where you have poorer reception (like in a basement), maybe the networks list will be smaller and there won't be a scrollbar


[1/15/2024 4:33 AM] tux_linux
but this should really be fixed


[1/15/2024 4:50 AM] .fullthrottle
I'm afraid that won't be possible (living in apartments), though I could probably fashion a Faraday cage by holding the Nia in a chip bag and having the open end facing and being right next to my router


[1/15/2024 4:51 AM] tux_linux
Yes, or a metal box
I have another idea


[1/15/2024 4:51 AM] tux_linux
you can install ITerm and connect to wifi from command line


[1/15/2024 4:52 AM] tux_linux
or connect usbnet and connect via command line with ssh


[1/15/2024 4:53 AM] tux_linux
is your device rooted


[1/15/2024 5:09 AM] .fullthrottle
Device is unrooted (as far as I'm aware), I just installed the image from here:
http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/n306c/

And then flashed it to my 64gb microSD from Balena on my Linux desktop


[1/15/2024 5:09 AM] tux_linux
ok
do you have access to a linux pc


[1/15/2024 5:09 AM] tux_linux
oh yes


[1/15/2024 5:09 AM] tux_linux
ok


[1/15/2024 5:09 AM] tux_linux
didnt read correctly


[1/15/2024 5:11 AM] tux_linux
do the following:
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt
mount /mnt/recoveryfs.squashfs /mnt1
dd if=/mnt1/opt/recovery/restore/zImage-root of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=81920
echo rooted | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=79872
umount /mnt1 /mnt
eject /dev/mmcblk0
```


[1/15/2024 5:11 AM] tux_linux
where mmcblk0 is the sd card's device node


[1/15/2024 5:11 AM] tux_linux
it should then be rooted


[1/15/2024 5:13 AM] tux_linux
also, enable usbnet:
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
echo true > /mnt/flags/USBNET_ENABLE
```


[1/15/2024 5:21 AM] .fullthrottle
Alright, I'll turn off my device, pop the SD out, put the card in a usb 3.0 card reader and then will run those

looks ok i think
did you resize the last partition?


[1/15/2024 5:36 AM] .fullthrottle
I don't believe so
I just popped my sd, and ran balena with the .img file

now I'm just seeing what to substitute in the above commands

so 
/dev/mmcblk0 == /dev/sda

/dev/mmcblk0p1 == /dev/sda1

and
/dev/mmcblk0p2 == /dev/sda2

correct?


[1/15/2024 5:36 AM] tux_linux
yes


[1/15/2024 5:36 AM] tux_linux
but i dont see how your 4th partition could be this large
maybe it's szybet's fault


[1/15/2024 5:36 AM] tux_linux
@Szybet is this normal


[1/15/2024 5:37 AM] tux_linux
partition is 14g in size!?


[1/15/2024 5:37 AM] .fullthrottle
I should mention that I'm using a 64gb card if that should matter


[1/15/2024 5:37 AM] tux_linux
it shouldnt expand automatically


[1/15/2024 5:37 AM] tux_linux
normally inkbox sd cards are 4gb by default


[1/15/2024 5:38 AM] tux_linux
the associations seem ok


[1/15/2024 5:39 AM] .fullthrottle

[1/15/2024 6:01 AM] .fullthrottle
it's back to inkbox


[1/15/2024 6:08 AM] tux_linux
good
it should export itself as a usbnet device


[1/15/2024 6:08 AM] tux_linux
then you do
```
ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1
ssh root@192.168.2.2
```
password is root


[1/15/2024 6:18 AM] kuratius
Balena feature?


[1/15/2024 6:20 AM] kuratius
That said 64 GB and 16 GB doesn't quite match


[1/15/2024 6:20 AM] kuratius
Maybe it's getting the size wrong?


[1/15/2024 6:21 AM] kuratius
Or szybet expanded it to max size because nias all use 16GB SDS anyway


[1/15/2024 6:22 AM] kuratius
Maybe gparted would give better info.


[1/15/2024 6:28 AM] .fullthrottle
welp, can't get to putting the password in

use qlineedit to show the wifi name text

and dont cut the wifi name anymore


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] tux_linux

did you fix it in later releases?


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] tux_linux
or not yet


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] szybet
nope


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] tux_linux
ok


[1/16/2024 2:55 AM] .fullthrottle
my password has some spaces in it, would I do something like this? 

`/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh network_name 'this is my network password'
`

edit: nevermind, I got a dhcp lease

Thanks for great work. Let's hope my Kobo revives from dead. Do I need a 4gb card for Inkbox 2.0 or 2gb will do?

Not working? That is the mirror
Are the links wrong

Me too. Same message. Tried to download but stopped and failed on Windows 11, Using default browser..


[1/17/2024 3:30 PM] szybet
right click and click allow download


[1/17/2024 3:30 PM] szybet
if thats not how it works, use a normal browser like firefox


[1/17/2024 3:32 PM] subhaniminhas
Yes, I think that must be an issue. However, alternate download link by @tux-linux is working. Now need to purchase a 4gb card. Then let's see if Kobo is back or not. 
Again greatly appreciate all the hard , selfless work. Love the idea and community.

do you have the n905**c** or n905**b**? the images are different depending on the revision

Don't know exactly, will try both

So I mounted the Kobo to my PC, dropped a .Epub file and a .pdf file, safely ejected the Kobo and inkbox doesn't seem to detect the two files

How do I go about loading books and datasheets?

`

rm: cannot remove '/data/onboard/.database/LocalLibrary.db': No such file or directory

this tells me it never created a LocalLibrary.db file

do I just `touch LocalLibrary.db` ?

or is there a script I can manually run to create/populate this file?

kobo:/# 
`

service inkbox_gui restart

or you can use my shortcut


[1/22/2024 5:17 PM] tux_linux
restart inkbox_gui


[1/22/2024 5:17 PM] tux_linux
also you need to `echo true > /boot/flags/GUI_DEBUG`

we still got an improvement from where we started off from, so that's still a win

Which font would you have liked to add

Opendyslexic

We should include it by default

But currently not any way to easily modify built-in fonts

Once you receive it come back and maybe we can figure out something


[1/23/2024 1:12 PM] .ckeen
I am familiar with embedded linux development, is the image signed in any way? Otherwise I could put it on before flashing it, or does it also need a sw change?


[1/23/2024 1:12 PM] tux_linux
Yes, it is signed


[1/23/2024 1:13 PM] tux_linux
But you can install a developer key that makes the system more permissive

Sounds like worth a try. Anyway I will get back once I get it and I am happy to test any preliminary version

Hey hey!

I just found out about InkBox and was interested in getting a Kobo to flash InkBox on. Was specifically looking at the Clara HD model and read the github issue thread. Is there anything else remaining that would be blocking support for it?

quick question: since my Kobo nia sets itself as an interface (enp8s0f3u1) I can ssh into and no longer as a usb mass storage device, what directory would I have so scp books and .pdf files to?

and since I can get it to connect to wifi via command line (though doesn't stay persistent once untethered from pc), is there a way to just load a wpa_supplicant file that tells it to just connect to either home wifi or my phone's hotspot (similar procedure to a raspberry pi I guess)?

apparently it works like crap

on the nia at least

on the libra 2 it seems to be fine

[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] tux_linux
do you think it would be better?


[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] kuratius
probably better than sending pngs probably because you can just send the framebuffer


[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] kuratius
depends on whether compression is wortwhile

it could also be optimized with xdamage or smth so it updates only the parts that changed on the screen


[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] tux_linux
probably not worth it on kobo


[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] tux_linux
too slow


[1/28/2024 4:25 AM] kuratius
I'd also look into whether proper video codecs can work

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/28/2024 4:26 AM] kuratius
like moonlight and whatnot


[1/28/2024 4:26 AM] tux_linux
but at this point I think you're just basically reimplementing vnc


[1/28/2024 4:26 AM] kuratius
there are video codecs that run on the nintendo ds


[1/28/2024 4:26 AM] kuratius
so something can probably work on a kobo


[1/28/2024 4:26 AM] tux_linux
doesn't that thing have a gpu


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] kuratius
sort of, but I think it's limited to very specific functions


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] kuratius
like triangle related stuff


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] tux_linux
so no video decoding thing


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] kuratius
instead of being a collection of multi purpose processors


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] kuratius
so it's a sort of vector unit thingy


[1/28/2024 4:27 AM] tux_linux
ok


[1/28/2024 4:28 AM] cake.jp
just curious, what's the closest to a usable eink "monitor" you've seen
besides $700+ dasung, boox etc


[1/28/2024 4:28 AM] kuratius
I'm not saying you cant figure out how to do video decoding with it, I'm just saying it's probably painful

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/28/2024 4:29 AM] tux_linux
my point is that there's no gpu on kobo


[1/28/2024 4:29 AM] tux_linux

nice


[1/28/2024 4:31 AM] kuratius
so I could probably try it on my pmOS install if I wanted


[1/28/2024 4:31 AM] tux_linux
also, nice thing: it runs on 12v car power
so no battery needed
unlimited runtime


[1/28/2024 4:31 AM] tux_linux
except when you power off the car when you go to a gas station hehe

[1/28/2024 4:33 AM] cake.jp
wasn't there a lot of ghosting even for text editing
i tried kindlevncviewer but it was flickering like crazy


[1/28/2024 4:33 AM] tux_linux
it was not too bad iirc


[1/28/2024 4:33 AM] tux_linux
i mean, not too bad for a screen like this


[1/28/2024 4:33 AM] kuratius
flickering is not ghosting


[1/28/2024 4:34 AM] kuratius
the flickering is a screen driver thing to prevent ghosting


[1/28/2024 4:34 AM] cake.jp
my bad : )))


[1/28/2024 4:34 AM] tux_linux
inkbox has some vnc viewer


[1/28/2024 4:34 AM] tux_linux
it's not *that* good


[1/28/2024 4:35 AM] kuratius
I still think some of the issues with the screen refreshes are probably screen driver related, like it chooses how to refresh based on the diff between before and after refresh

{Reactions}
👍 

[1/28/2024 4:36 AM] kuratius
so if you update more than x pixels or if you update pixels by more than a certain amount it will do full refreshes for partial regions or the entire screen


[1/28/2024 4:36 AM] tux_linux
also this


[1/28/2024 4:36 AM] tux_linux
yea
but i think that can mostly be controlled in software


[1/28/2024 4:39 AM] tux_linux
also, writing docs with vim on a kobo touch n905b+rpi+vnc

this was sometimes horrible


[1/28/2024 4:40 AM] tux_linux
this was when I had a laptop but the battery was dead so it worked only on ac power


[1/28/2024 4:40 AM] tux_linux
so i relied on rpi to get things done on the road


[1/28/2024 4:40 AM] tux_linux

hi! I am researching eink tablets/ereaders, I want to get one to view my PC screen with VNC. so I'm looking into what's going to do that best :)


[2/9/2024 2:07 AM] .mouseless
i'm thinking of using this:  https://github.com/everydayanchovies/eink-vnc
but it hasn't had any updates in 2 years, and I haven't found anyone saying if it still works or not lol


[2/9/2024 10:52 AM] szybet
this one doesn't worked for me and won't propably work for you because I'm a inkbox developer who uses rust soo


[2/9/2024 10:53 AM] szybet
inkbox has a xorg one which you propably could figure out to make it work


[2/9/2024 10:53 AM] szybet
but


[2/9/2024 10:53 AM] szybet
you are in luck, I was bored recently!

[2/9/2024 10:54 AM] szybet
This one is not using vnc protocol but a custom one, the code is shitty, it could be faster but it works like on the video ( you can choose )


[2/9/2024 10:54 AM] szybet
no touch too


[2/9/2024 10:54 AM] szybet
you could improve it yourself


[2/9/2024 10:57 AM] szybet
oh you were talking on #dev too


[2/9/2024 10:58 AM] szybet
well this allows you to mirror things from PC, you can create a virtual display for it soo


[2/9/2024 11:24 AM] .mouseless
cool stuff! once i decide on what to buy i'll give it a go

[2/10/2024 9:32 PM] szybet
yea replace it


[2/10/2024 9:34 PM] szybet
is it for the nia?


[2/10/2024 10:16 PM] passiveaggressor
Yeah

[2/10/2024 10:18 PM] szybet
it's the nia model A with audio and USB keyboard and mouse


[2/10/2024 10:18 PM] szybet
;)


[2/10/2024 10:18 PM] passiveaggressor
Oooh


[2/10/2024 10:31 PM] passiveaggressor
Bloody hell, looks like you have to order 12000 switches minimum to get that model. I think I'll live without the power button


[2/10/2024 10:31 PM] kuratius
order a broken nia?


[2/10/2024 10:32 PM] kuratius
like on ebay and whatnot


[2/10/2024 10:33 PM] passiveaggressor
Hmm that's a good idea too, though i can almost live without fixing it


[2/10/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
look for replacement buttons


[2/10/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
it doesnt need to be the exact model


[2/10/2024 10:38 PM] szybet
I would just solder a tht one and rotate it ;p


[2/10/2024 10:43 PM] passiveaggressor
There seems to be a lack of switches in that exact size 7.0x3.5


[2/10/2024 10:43 PM] passiveaggressor
Hey hey though it's literally still working


[2/10/2024 10:44 PM] passiveaggressor
I can still click it by inserting a stick inside

so fully DIY

[2/10/2024 10:48 PM] szybet
nicolas, the creator of the project is one year younger than me and didn't go to a IT school so also DIY


[2/10/2024 10:52 PM] passiveaggressor

[2/10/2024 11:13 PM] passiveaggressor
How do I change boot flags? Is it something to do with chroot? Squash fs?


[2/10/2024 11:13 PM] passiveaggressor
'Initialization process
InkBox OS is probably not like your standard Linux distribution you have installed on your PC or at work. Instead of using a standard root filesystem stored as a whole in a partition, that part of the framework is in fact a SquashFS file. At boot, it gets mounted by the initrd with the script [initrd-root]/etc/init.d/overlay-mount. A special FUSE-based filesystem layer, overlayfs-fuse, permits a read-write root filesystem with the command ifsctl mnt rootfs rw. Otherwise, it is always read-only to minimize flash storage writes and extend the MMC's lifespan as much as possible. When all the initial mount process is completed, the rootfs can be chroot'ed into to run the main framework. The main partition layout looks like this:

PART. NUMBER    LABEL        DESCRIPTION
1        boot        Contains boot flags
2        recoveryfs    Recovery partition used to restore InkBox OS
3        rootfs        Contains the rootfs SquashFS archive + OpenSSL digest
4        user        All user data, such as config options, books, InkBox Software Archives (*.isa)'


[2/10/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm not sure where to look for boot


[2/10/2024 11:14 PM] [matrix] Szybet
in partition 1


[2/10/2024 11:14 PM] szybet
feel free to update the wiki on github to include information you lacked


[2/10/2024 11:16 PM] passiveaggressor
The problem is conceptual for me, how do I find partition 1? Fdisk - l on Linux?


[2/10/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
i prefer lsblk


[2/10/2024 11:32 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay I think I understand, I must mount the disk first before I can access it I think but I think I just can't find the partitions on windows


[2/10/2024 11:35 PM] tux_linux
use linux


[2/10/2024 11:35 PM] tux_linux
probably a better option


[2/10/2024 11:47 PM] passiveaggressor
I am missing critical information, I am unable to find the partition on Linux too


[2/10/2024 11:47 PM] passiveaggressor
Do i connect to usb and say yes I want to manage my books


[2/10/2024 11:48 PM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet
you connect the sd card correctly?


[2/10/2024 11:48 PM] [matrix] Szybet
directly?


[2/10/2024 11:48 PM] passiveaggressor
Oh, am I supposed take the sd card out?


[2/10/2024 11:48 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/10/2024 11:48 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay that is probably it


[2/10/2024 11:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
or root the device and do it from the inside using ssh


[2/10/2024 11:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
via usbnet


[2/10/2024 11:49 PM] [matrix] Szybet
for most flags you need root kernel anyway


[2/10/2024 11:49 PM] passiveaggressor
I don't have WiFi so I need usbnet to get WiFi first


[2/10/2024 11:50 PM] [matrix] Szybet
then you need rooted kernel


[2/10/2024 11:50 PM] [matrix] Szybet
get into diagnostics mode and root it


[2/11/2024 12:03 AM] passiveaggressor
Oh I didn't know realise the wiki was on github either, i see now


[2/11/2024 12:04 AM] [matrix] Szybet
use only the one on github


[2/11/2024 12:04 AM] [matrix] Szybet
the site wiki is abandoned


[2/11/2024 12:04 AM] [matrix] Szybet
but tux-linux wont shut it down for some reason


[2/11/2024 12:04 AM] [matrix] Szybet
;-;


[2/11/2024 12:31 AM] passiveaggressor
I don't have kernel flags in the boot folder, do I write my own? I only have the interactive ones


[2/11/2024 12:32 AM] passiveaggressor
Wait sorry I mean, I only have 9 flags


[2/11/2024 12:37 AM] matterbridge#2154
[matrix] Szybet
What


[2/11/2024 12:38 AM] passiveaggressor
There r 20 flags in github but my boot only has 9


[2/11/2024 12:47 AM] [matrix] Szybet
Create them


[2/11/2024 10:23 PM] passiveaggressor
I have boost usb debug and usbnet enable set to true, is that correct? How do I proceed to usb net from there?


[2/11/2024 10:25 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm just not getting any boot screen


[2/11/2024 10:25 PM] szybet
what


[2/11/2024 10:26 PM] szybet
have you rooted your device?


[2/11/2024 10:26 PM] passiveaggressor
Do you mean rw rootfs?


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
no


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
so you propably haven't


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
you need to get into diagnostics mode


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
and then click root the device


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] passiveaggressor
Does kobo nia support diagnostics mode?


[2/11/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
yes


[2/11/2024 10:28 PM] szybet
Basic diagnostics kernel is not diagnostics mode


[2/11/2024 10:28 PM] szybet
those are 2 seperate things


[2/11/2024 10:29 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay I see diagnostics mode, diags boot flag


[2/11/2024 10:30 PM] szybet
yes, but that's not the only way to get there


[2/11/2024 10:30 PM] szybet
when you boot the device you can spam the power button with click to enter it too


[2/11/2024 10:31 PM] szybet
you could create a wiki page about diagnostics mode, or other things you didn't know but now know :D


[2/11/2024 10:31 PM] passiveaggressor
Yes I will


[2/11/2024 10:32 PM] szybet
thanks


[2/11/2024 10:32 PM] szybet
any contribution is welcome, we are pretty lonely here


[2/11/2024 10:36 PM] passiveaggressor
How do I view the original source code of the kobo ereader? You must have done so to know what to do right


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
what... what


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] kuratius
they are legally required to publish sources


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] tux_linux
no


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] kuratius
I mean the os


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] kuratius
not the reader app


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] kuratius
I think that's what he means, anyway


[2/11/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
go to #future 🫥


[2/11/2024 10:38 PM] passiveaggressor
I mean the kobo original firmwate


[2/11/2024 10:38 PM] szybet
what part of firmware? bootloader? kernel? reader app? background components?


[2/11/2024 10:39 PM] passiveaggressor
Ig all of it. I saw that you can clone the sd card and read some of it, but that was from a kobo 10+ years ago

the rest is not


[2/11/2024 10:40 PM] passiveaggressor

[2/11/2024 10:41 PM] szybet
inkbox is fully open source


[2/11/2024 10:41 PM] passiveaggressor
Did you reverse engineer the closed source parts?


[2/11/2024 10:42 PM] passiveaggressor
Also I am now in diagnostics mode, did I miss the usbnet window?


[2/11/2024 10:42 PM] szybet
nope, it's just linux with an app so there was no need for that


[2/11/2024 10:43 PM] szybet
no, you need now to root your kernel


[2/11/2024 10:43 PM] szybet
root the device


[2/11/2024 10:45 PM] passiveaggressor
Is this chroot?


[2/11/2024 10:45 PM] szybet
what?


[2/11/2024 10:45 PM] szybet
maybe post a photo


[2/11/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm not sure how to root the device, you mean log in as root?


[2/11/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/wiki/General-information#standard-and-rooted this page talks about root but doesn't say how to root the device

[2/11/2024 10:49 PM] szybet
connect your device to a charger


[2/11/2024 10:49 PM] szybet
it cant be discharged now


[2/11/2024 10:49 PM] szybet
or it will break and you will need to write the os once more

How to connect to WiFi using USBNET

1 Turn Ereader off
2 Take SD card out of ereader, connect to PC.
3 Mount the boot partition. Using either disk part on windows or on Linux by fdisk - l then sudo mount partition /mnt
4 Change boot flags, ENABLE_USBNET, DIAGS_BOOT and BOOT_USB_DEBUG to true using nano on Linux. Perhaps on Windows you may need permission to change files.
5 Put sd card back into ereader, keep it charged and reboot. Select reset options, click reset and root device. 

That sound about right?


[2/11/2024 10:56 PM] szybet
looks good


[2/11/2024 11:01 PM] passiveaggressor
After restoring is there a black screen for a while?


[2/11/2024 11:01 PM] szybet
yep, wait 2 minutes jsut to be sure and turn it on


[2/11/2024 11:08 PM] passiveaggressor
After reboot I am now back in inkbox OS set up mode


[2/11/2024 11:08 PM] passiveaggressor
Did I miss usb debug? Or do I reboot agaib


[2/11/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
go through it


[2/11/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
thats fine


[2/11/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
then connect your usb to pc


[2/11/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
if no new network interfasce appearts, you will need to create the enable usbnet flag once again


[2/11/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay now there r only 7 flags but ig the diff is now device is roote fright? Do I enable boot usb debug as well? And I no longer set diags boot to true


[2/11/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Since I've already rooted


[2/11/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
no, boot usb debug is another thing


[2/11/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
set them to true


[2/11/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
only usb net


[2/11/2024 11:17 PM] szybet
enable


[2/11/2024 11:26 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay I have done so but I don't think I am able to telnet still


[2/11/2024 11:31 PM] szybet
no telnet, ssh


[2/11/2024 11:31 PM] szybet
first, do you see a new network interface


[2/11/2024 11:31 PM] szybet
are you on linux or windows?


[2/11/2024 11:32 PM] passiveaggressor
Oh ssh right


[2/11/2024 11:32 PM] passiveaggressor
Both, I am using vm on windows


[2/11/2024 11:32 PM] szybet
then you need to pass throught the usb connection to linux


[2/11/2024 11:33 PM] szybet
then linus should see it as a network device


[2/11/2024 11:33 PM] szybet
should show something new in ip a


[2/11/2024 11:33 PM] szybet
`ip a`


[2/11/2024 11:34 PM] szybet
then you need to set the ip address for it `192.168.2.3/24`


[2/11/2024 11:34 PM] szybet
then ssh into 192.168.2.1


[2/11/2024 11:34 PM] szybet
user root


[2/11/2024 11:34 PM] szybet
password root


[2/11/2024 11:34 PM] szybet
you should be in

[2/12/2024 12:10 AM] passiveaggressor
Yea nah I couldn't figure it oht


[2/12/2024 12:11 AM] passiveaggressor
I tried ip a the sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.1 broadcast + dev enp30s
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev enp30s


[2/12/2024 12:12 AM] tux_linux
Isn't it enp3s0?


[2/12/2024 12:13 AM] passiveaggressor
It might be bc I'm using vm idk


[2/12/2024 12:13 AM] passiveaggressor
It probably was enp3s0


[2/12/2024 12:14 AM] passiveaggressor
Enp0s3


[2/12/2024 12:17 AM] passiveaggressor
My 192.168.2.0/24 was 192.168.2.1/32 as well in ip a


[2/12/2024 12:22 AM] tux_linux
but the vm sees the device?


[2/12/2024 12:25 AM] tux_linux
no, you need to ssh to 192.168.2.2


[2/12/2024 12:26 AM] tux_linux
.2.2 is the kobo's ip


[2/12/2024 12:26 AM] tux_linux
your computer's is .2.1 or .2.3, whatever you choose

[2/12/2024 12:51 AM] tux_linux
(the 'Connect' prompt)


[2/12/2024 12:51 AM] tux_linux
create a folder called `.apps`


[2/12/2024 12:51 AM] tux_linux
unzip the file in this folder


[2/12/2024 12:52 AM] tux_linux
don't create a new folder for it or anything


[2/12/2024 12:52 AM] tux_linux
then eject device, then head over to the apps tab (the grid icon with 9 dots)


[2/12/2024 12:52 AM] tux_linux
click <Launch> next to <ITerm>


[2/12/2024 12:56 AM] passiveaggressor
Okay I'm having a new problem now, I can't even see my device anymore lol


[2/12/2024 12:56 AM] passiveaggressor
I will try that though thank you

[2/12/2024 1:03 AM] passiveaggressor
BTW why did u guys use qt, couldn't you have built on top of the original firmware?


[2/12/2024 1:03 AM] passiveaggressor
Or is that not possible to do because a lot is proprietary


[2/12/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
The goal was to have an open-source os


[2/12/2024 1:07 AM] tux_linux
There are licensed adobe binaries in the stock os


[2/12/2024 1:08 AM] passiveaggressor
I see


[2/12/2024 1:08 AM] tux_linux
Also the stock os is hilariously outdated


[2/12/2024 1:08 AM] tux_linux
Even more outdated than inkbox


[2/12/2024 1:08 AM] tux_linux
Like, glibc from 2013


[2/12/2024 1:08 AM] tux_linux
We use musl from 2019-20ish


[2/12/2024 1:09 AM] passiveaggressor
Hmm


[2/12/2024 1:10 AM] passiveaggressor
I think I see a problem why I failed earlier, when I connect usb, the virtual WiFi goes out


[2/12/2024 1:10 AM] passiveaggressor
Or at least I think that's what happened


[2/12/2024 1:14 AM] passiveaggressor
Yea I broke something, I earlier forgot to eject and unplugged now I can no longer access usb file storabe


[2/12/2024 1:21 AM] tux_linux
Hm
See if you can access usbnet from diags


[2/12/2024 1:21 AM] tux_linux
If it is rooted there will be a new option


[2/12/2024 1:21 AM] tux_linux

Does e ink refresh rate depend on software? Bc e ink anchovies is 30 fps but. I thought ereader can't be fast


[2/12/2024 8:46 PM] [matrix] Szybet
Depends, grey folor are very slow but black white is pretty fast

Look up my demo of the vnc app, the speed there is not limited by eink

Also depends on the panel technology etc


[2/12/2024 8:47 PM] passiveaggressor
Dithering?


[2/12/2024 8:51 PM] [matrix] Szybet
The process of making black and white color take shades of grey by making it balance how much of each kolor to use at subpixel level


[2/12/2024 8:54 PM] passiveaggressor
Hmm


[2/12/2024 8:54 PM] passiveaggressor
Also okay I understand new thing usb networking disables usb storage thus I thought I broke it but no


[2/12/2024 8:55 PM] passiveaggressor
Also, what are 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.0 supposed to represent?


[2/12/2024 8:55 PM] passiveaggressor
Also also, do you know how I can install everydayanchovied e ink? There are no installation instructions, but a binary file


[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
Those are io addreses?


[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
Ip


[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] szybet
What


[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] passiveaggressor
But why are they different Ip addresses, one is for the host pc, what is the other if 192.168.2.2 is the kobo


[2/12/2024 8:58 PM] passiveaggressor
For usbnet


[2/12/2024 9:00 PM] szybet
2.1 would be the default gateway but it doesnt exist, 2.0 means the whole network because the subnet starts at 2.1


[2/12/2024 9:00 PM] szybet
You dont need to care about it


[2/12/2024 9:00 PM] szybet
2.2 is kobo 2.3 should be you


[2/12/2024 9:00 PM] szybet
Does your networking work or it doesnt?


[2/12/2024 9:02 PM] passiveaggressor
No I couldn't get it to work, possible problem may be usbnet disconnects my virtual network adapter


[2/12/2024 9:02 PM] passiveaggressor
Meaning my vm lose wifi


[2/12/2024 9:02 PM] passiveaggressor
Not sure if that was the problem or not


[2/12/2024 9:02 PM] szybet
Idk, you should install linux bare metal


[2/12/2024 9:04 PM] passiveaggressor
Yea also how do I install https://github.com/everydayanchovies/eink-vnc?tab=readme-ov-file on regular kobo device? Do I need compile? How do I do thag

[2/12/2024 9:35 PM] szybet
If you update the wiki with a few things you learned i could give you some commands to compile this project or guide to use my own demo id you dont care about touch


[2/12/2024 9:36 PM] passiveaggressor
Wait first I must finish the usb net thing, tux Linux gave me an alternative, Iterm command line


[2/12/2024 9:36 PM] passiveaggressor
Since I could not figure out how to do usb networking


[2/12/2024 9:39 PM] passiveaggressor
But see this where did I go wrong


[2/12/2024 10:24 PM] passiveaggressor
@tux-linux can I use the..apps folder already there? And should the file structure be. APPS-ITERM-ITERM-CONTENTS? OR ONLY one Iterm folder


[2/12/2024 10:26 PM] szybet
You set the ip to the wrong interface

Also the structure is described on the wiki


[2/12/2024 10:27 PM] szybet
@tux-linux redirect the wiki site to github wiki


[2/12/2024 10:28 PM] passiveaggressor
Which interface is that?


[2/12/2024 10:30 PM] szybet
The one that appears when you connect the ereader


[2/12/2024 10:30 PM] szybet
Check before and after connecting the device


[2/12/2024 10:31 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm not sure what interface happens, but I've got Iterm working now


[2/12/2024 10:33 PM] tux_linux
then you can try ssh root@127.0.0.1


[2/12/2024 10:33 PM] tux_linux
password is root


[2/12/2024 10:34 PM] szybet
It appears


[2/12/2024 10:35 PM] szybet
Before it, it doesnt exist


[2/12/2024 10:35 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay I am welcoming in 127 now


[2/12/2024 10:37 PM] passiveaggressor
Which interface do you mean?


[2/12/2024 10:37 PM] passiveaggressor
Can you show a picture


[2/12/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
Ugh


[2/12/2024 10:38 PM] szybet
Take a picture of "ip a" before you connect the ereader to the vm and after you conmect it


[2/12/2024 10:38 PM] szybet
The difference will be the new interface


[2/12/2024 10:39 PM] passiveaggressor
Er what package manager is there?


[2/12/2024 10:39 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm trying to get nmcli


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] passiveaggressor
So I can connect to WiFi, because I have the WiFi name too long problem


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
none


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
well, kind of


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
there are scripts to connect to wifi


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
dont use nmcli


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] tux_linux
`/usr/local/bin/wifi/toggle.sh on`


[2/12/2024 10:41 PM] tux_linux
`/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network "ssid" "pass"`


[2/12/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
That script says not found


[2/12/2024 10:47 PM] passiveaggressor
The second one


[2/12/2024 10:48 PM] passiveaggressor
Ah there's no. Sh


[2/12/2024 10:48 PM] passiveaggressor
That's why it failed


[2/12/2024 10:53 PM] passiveaggressor
She's working she's alive!


[2/12/2024 10:53 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay now back to trying to do usbnet


[2/12/2024 10:55 PM] szybet
Do what i said

Wait when you want to tell someone to use a argument in a command, do you put it in quote marks?


[2/12/2024 11:21 PM] passiveaggressor
Like nano 'filename'


[2/12/2024 11:21 PM] passiveaggressor
Or is it just nano filenamr


[2/12/2024 11:22 PM] tux_linux
" "


[2/12/2024 11:22 PM] tux_linux
"<filename>"


[2/12/2024 11:22 PM] tux_linux
also use backticks to show it's a command


[2/12/2024 11:22 PM] tux_linux
\`hi\`


[2/12/2024 11:23 PM] tux_linux
`hi`


[2/12/2024 11:23 PM] passiveaggressor
Does it also implies its a string?

[2/12/2024 11:23 PM] tux_linux
i don't know

left to your interpretation

Am I able to edit boot flags from inside the kobo? Also for the vnc server, I can only see part of the screen, is the way to scale down the image on the server side or client side+ can it go landscape?


[2/12/2024 11:39 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[2/12/2024 11:39 PM] szybet
Via shell, look to /boot/flags

/boot


[2/12/2024 11:39 PM] szybet
As for vnc idk


[2/12/2024 11:39 PM] tux_linux
Nothing for vnc i think


[2/12/2024 11:40 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay thanks I will add that you can edit boot flags with Iterm then


[2/12/2024 11:41 PM] szybet
In regular shell via ssh too


[2/12/2024 11:41 PM] szybet
Like via wifi


[2/12/2024 11:41 PM] szybet
as for vnc, look for other app alternatives

[2/12/2024 11:47 PM] passiveaggressor
Don't do which one?


[2/12/2024 11:48 PM] szybet
Without battery


[2/12/2024 11:48 PM] passiveaggressor
Why not usb is around 4 to 5v and the battery is also 4.2v


[2/12/2024 11:49 PM] passiveaggressor
In fact, when you plug USB in, the same thing is still happening right?


[2/12/2024 11:49 PM] szybet
Nope, nope, nope its about power delivery not voltage


[2/12/2024 11:49 PM] szybet
The tldr is usb has a limit on power delivery and your device can shut off if it wont receive enough power


[2/12/2024 11:49 PM] szybet
Or even something worse can happen


[2/12/2024 11:50 PM] szybet
When the usb is plugged in it mostly uses usb power and then if it neexs the battery, so you are not draining the battery anyway


[2/12/2024 11:50 PM] passiveaggressor
Hmm I see


[2/12/2024 11:51 PM] passiveaggressor
As for everyday vnc anchovy, I see it already been compiled


[2/12/2024 11:51 PM] passiveaggressor
In releases


[2/12/2024 11:52 PM] tux_linux
its probably not compatible with inkbox


[2/12/2024 11:52 PM] tux_linux
we dont use glibc as the main libc


[2/12/2024 11:52 PM] tux_linux
maybe you can get it to work with some hacking


[2/12/2024 11:52 PM] tux_linux
but provided you have a kobo nia, it's most probably useless to try

[2/12/2024 11:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Also how do I learn like hardware software interaction? Like I just don't know what it is like how you would connect to WiFi firmware


[2/12/2024 11:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Hardware I meab


[2/12/2024 11:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Architecture maybe the word idk


[2/13/2024 12:00 AM] szybet
First learn how to code, then learn how the code works


[2/13/2024 12:00 AM] szybet
Anyway, goodnight


[2/13/2024 12:00 AM] passiveaggressor
Okay good night thanks yall


[2/13/2024 12:01 AM] passiveaggressor
There's learning to code, like just purely the syntax and then there's the rest eh, like the relationship between code and hardware etc. I am only done tbe syntax bit

it's already good


[2/13/2024 12:14 AM] passiveaggressor
What is already good?


[2/13/2024 12:14 AM] tux_linux
syntax


[2/13/2024 12:15 AM] passiveaggressor
Like it's speaking a language but not knowing what to use it for. You must know the words open sesame to open the magic, but where do you use it? With whom? Where do I find the gates yknow

if you want the simplest example with wifi this is the script that toggles interfaces on or off

it's the init program


[2/13/2024 12:19 AM] passiveaggressor
Hmm I don't rmemeber what c syntax is like. Void is one the 6 types of variables right? Main is the main function


[2/13/2024 12:19 AM] passiveaggressor
Int main void


[2/13/2024 12:19 AM] tux_linux
probably


[2/13/2024 12:20 AM] tux_linux
i learned it myself
so sometimes i can say wrong things


[2/13/2024 12:20 AM] passiveaggressor
Hmm wait back to everydayanchovies thing, szybet said it needs rust and cargo, but it seems that rust and cargo are built into the vnc compiled file


[2/13/2024 12:21 AM] passiveaggressor
When you guys say it doesn't work, do you mean it doesn't work at all?


[2/13/2024 12:21 AM] passiveaggressor
That nobody else apart from the creator got it working


[2/13/2024 4:45 AM] tux_linux
btw


[2/13/2024 4:45 AM] tux_linux
you can search the whole gutenberg catalog and download books from it

Hellooo, I wanted to thank you for making this project a reality! It's really cool to see something so polished for the e-reader (I found for 50c in a thriftstore, as they thought it was a picture frame)


[2/13/2024 3:49 PM] szybet
lol lucky you


[2/13/2024 3:49 PM] szybet
it's not polished


[2/13/2024 3:49 PM] szybet
it's usable


[2/13/2024 3:51 PM] szybet
Hello


[2/13/2024 3:51 PM] szybet
wrong order ;p


[2/13/2024 3:52 PM] szybet
You are an artist, hmmm - We are looking for a logo for this project. If you are interested, check out #future


[2/13/2024 9:24 PM] passiveaggressor
Was the WiFi issue fixed?


[2/13/2024 9:24 PM] passiveaggressor
Do i have to manually edit wpa supplicant


[2/13/2024 9:31 PM] passiveaggressor
Also the vnc viewer crashes after a few seconds of use, is that normal


[2/13/2024 9:32 PM] passiveaggressor
Also is the kobo firmware Og gui open source?

User friendly experience should have an asterisk for now 😜

Yes, what device?


[2/13/2024 9:56 PM] szybet
Propably not???


[2/13/2024 9:56 PM] szybet
What error? Anything?


[2/13/2024 9:56 PM] szybet
No...

There is a reason we are here


[2/13/2024 9:57 PM] passiveaggressor
So how did nickel menu get added to the original firmware?


[2/13/2024 9:57 PM] szybet
I agree


[2/13/2024 9:57 PM] szybet
WIZARDS AND ASSEMBLY REVERSE ENGINEERING, THIS IS SOME REALLY SCARY THINGS🥴


[2/13/2024 9:57 PM] passiveaggressor
Nia, when I use the connect_to_network shell script, it says wpa supplicant something but when I check etc/wpa_supp it is empty, and I did make sure to make rootfs read write


[2/13/2024 9:58 PM] szybet
Etc wpa supp doesnt matter


[2/13/2024 9:58 PM] szybet
Which nia


[2/13/2024 9:58 PM] szybet
What wifi problems do you exactly have


[2/13/2024 9:58 PM] passiveaggressor
I can't tell, the vnc viewer seems to be problematic because you can get stuck on a black screen forever, and j I have no power button. How do I see if there is an error? Do I boot into diagnostics.


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] passiveaggressor
So after I reboot I gave to manually connect to WiFi agaib


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Using iterm


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Remember my WiFi names are too long so I can't connect using the buttons


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] szybet
Ssh from your pc into the ereader


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] szybet
Which nia


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] szybet
A or c?


[2/13/2024 9:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Model a


[2/13/2024 10:00 PM] szybet
Xorg is experimental, keep that in mind


[2/13/2024 10:00 PM] szybet
And run watch date, if it freezes then its a wifi issue


[2/13/2024 10:00 PM] szybet
If not, its a xorg issue


[2/13/2024 10:00 PM] passiveaggressor
Is xorg the vnc?


[2/13/2024 10:00 PM] szybet
Vnc uses xorg, yes


[2/13/2024 10:01 PM] passiveaggressor
So I will:connect to WiFi using script, then ssh into PC xrun watch date then wait?


[2/13/2024 10:04 PM] szybet
Then launch vnc


[2/13/2024 10:04 PM] passiveaggressor
Wait hold on the vnc is a separate issue


[2/13/2024 10:04 PM] passiveaggressor
It crashes after I move the mouse and click it seems


[2/13/2024 10:04 PM] passiveaggressor
Either that or jt just crashes after a few seconds


[2/13/2024 10:05 PM] szybet
What does crash mean


[2/13/2024 10:05 PM] szybet
Black screen?


[2/13/2024 10:06 PM] passiveaggressor
No frozen forever, must reboot
L

[2/13/2024 10:07 PM] szybet
Check if its the wifi issue, do what i said


[2/13/2024 10:09 PM] passiveaggressor
Also the browser keyboard likes to flash


[2/13/2024 10:09 PM] passiveaggressor
Whereas other guickeyboard dont

[2/13/2024 10:24 PM] passiveaggressor
Sigh how do I exit out of vnc server from the kobo


[2/13/2024 10:26 PM] szybet
many ctrl c


[2/13/2024 10:26 PM] szybet
idk


[2/13/2024 10:26 PM] passiveaggressor
Rn I'm stuck on a black screen with no way to end vnc


[2/13/2024 10:28 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay I reboot from ssh


[2/13/2024 10:28 PM] passiveaggressor
Time to start again


[2/13/2024 10:28 PM] passiveaggressor
Error code 6


[2/13/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
okay lets conclude this vnc sucks


[2/13/2024 10:37 PM] szybet
do you need touch with your vnc?


[2/13/2024 10:38 PM] passiveaggressor
No


[2/13/2024 10:38 PM] passiveaggressor
Also I'm now stuck

Please enter the password for the


[2/13/2024 10:39 PM] passiveaggressor
And I can't type anything,


[2/13/2024 10:39 PM] passiveaggressor
So what about the WiFi not remembering itself issue?


[2/13/2024 10:40 PM] szybet
what do you mean


[2/13/2024 10:40 PM] szybet
okay then, let's go with my vnc


[2/13/2024 10:40 PM] passiveaggressor
Every reboot I must log in to WiFi again


[2/13/2024 10:42 PM] szybet
thats normal


[2/13/2024 10:42 PM] szybet
its an ereader, wifi takes battery


[2/13/2024 10:43 PM] szybet
you can create an openrc service to log you in


[2/13/2024 10:43 PM] szybet
btw you can use usbnet? no need for wifi


[2/13/2024 10:43 PM] szybet
for my vnc you need linux, i think its time to install it bare metal?


[2/13/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
Sigh I used to have Ubuntu installed but I got rid of it cuz I never used it


[2/13/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
Btw


[2/13/2024 10:46 PM] passiveaggressor
Does fbink do partial refresh?


[2/13/2024 10:47 PM] szybet
yes it can


[2/13/2024 10:47 PM] szybet
welp what can i say, maybe wsl?


[2/13/2024 10:47 PM] passiveaggressor
Did nijule reverse engineer or was that part of the open source


[2/13/2024 10:47 PM] szybet
windows subsystem for linux


[2/13/2024 10:47 PM] szybet
reverse engineered and just looked at the driver code that was available

Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows developers to run a Linux environment without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting. There are two versions of WSL: WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 1 was first released on August 2, 2016, and acts as a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables (in ELF for...

[2/13/2024 10:50 PM] szybet
what?


[2/13/2024 10:51 PM] passiveaggressor
Could you write the instructions in the meantime


[2/13/2024 10:51 PM] szybet
for what do you need a sd card


[2/13/2024 10:51 PM] passiveaggressor
I'll get a boot able Linux


[2/13/2024 10:51 PM] passiveaggressor
I don't have a usb


[2/13/2024 10:51 PM] passiveaggressor

[2/13/2024 10:54 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 10:54 PM] szybet
completly nope


[2/13/2024 10:54 PM] szybet
.


[2/13/2024 10:54 PM] passiveaggressor
To install the vnc app


[2/13/2024 10:54 PM] passiveaggressor
Or is it not a vnc app


[2/13/2024 10:55 PM] passiveaggressor
Can you write an overview of what to do bc it'll take a while to install Linux


[2/13/2024 10:55 PM] passiveaggressor
Actually ill just use a Linux vm


[2/13/2024 10:56 PM] szybet
then you will mirror the linux vm


[2/13/2024 10:56 PM] szybet
its not vnc, its bare


[2/13/2024 10:57 PM] passiveaggressor
Wdym, it's not the vnc protocol just a bare mirror


[2/13/2024 10:57 PM] szybet
bare mirror but made in a stupid way, its a demo for something greater later


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] szybet
you need the `scrot` screenshot tool and `convert` command from image magick in your liunx vm


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] passiveaggressor
Hey!


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] passiveaggressor
Wait Ive already used scrot


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] passiveaggressor
Tux Linux wrote one using gnome screen shot


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] passiveaggressor
And I changed it to scrot


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/13/2024 10:58 PM] passiveaggressor
Is it that one?


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
nope, its fully mine


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
its just so stupid it takes ss


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] passiveaggressor
So it takes SS, then fbink ss


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
like i said, demo


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
its more complicated than that


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
but yes


[2/13/2024 10:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Framebuffer


[2/13/2024 11:02 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 11:02 PM] szybet
still complicated than that


[2/13/2024 11:02 PM] szybet
learn to code then i will start explaining

you need to connect through usbnet


[2/13/2024 11:03 PM] passiveaggressor
I mean I know some python


[2/13/2024 11:03 PM] szybet
your vm


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] szybet
learn rust and c++


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] szybet
after you learn a second language it will be just a tool you will use


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] szybet
language is not important, it's just a tool


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] passiveaggressor
Er what do I do with the qt file


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] passiveaggressor
Yea ur right


[2/13/2024 11:04 PM] passiveaggressor
I only know the language, not how to use it


[2/13/2024 11:05 PM] szybet
here is the problem


[2/13/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
well anyway


[2/13/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
open 2 terminals


[2/13/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
ssh into the kobo from them


[2/13/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
in one run chroot /kobo


[2/13/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
also first copy the qt file into /kobo/


[2/13/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
then


[2/13/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
then


[2/13/2024 11:08 PM] passiveaggressor
Apps folder or nk


[2/13/2024 11:08 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 11:08 PM] szybet
scp


[2/13/2024 11:08 PM] szybet
via ssh the file


[2/13/2024 11:08 PM] szybet
directly to /kobo folder


[2/13/2024 11:09 PM] passiveaggressor
Ah there's no kobo folder anyway I see


[2/13/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
ssh into the device


[2/13/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
SSH


[2/13/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
get a shell


[2/13/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
there is a kobo folder


[2/13/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
```
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/lib QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo ./thisappqt
```


[2/13/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
thats how you launch the qt app


[2/13/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
before it kill inkbox with `killall inkbox inkbox-bin`


[2/13/2024 11:11 PM] szybet
after executing chroot


[2/13/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
then in the second terminal execute the kobo backend, you need in it adjust arguments about ip address to your pc


[2/13/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
it should work


[2/13/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
you propably need to rotate the screen via `echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate` something like that, maybe its 0 2 3 not 1, you need to try a few times


[2/13/2024 11:13 PM] szybet
thats it


[2/13/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Ah kill all inkbox that's how I could have ended the vnc


[2/13/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Wait no


[2/13/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Vnc was a qt


[2/13/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
nope


[2/13/2024 11:15 PM] szybet
you could look up htop what vnc process is and kill it there


[2/13/2024 11:15 PM] passiveaggressor
I tried ps

[2/13/2024 11:26 PM] szybet
use htop and look for xorg processes


[2/13/2024 11:29 PM] passiveaggressor
The answer is yes


[2/13/2024 11:29 PM] passiveaggressor
I must set it up each time


[2/13/2024 11:30 PM] passiveaggressor
Oh x org I was looking for vnc


[2/13/2024 11:31 PM] szybet
ignore the time, doesnt matter


[2/13/2024 11:40 PM] passiveaggressor
Do i put inside the kobo file or the kobo/kobo file


[2/13/2024 11:43 PM] szybet
/kobo/qtfile


[2/13/2024 11:46 PM] passiveaggressor
Do i make a new folder?


[2/13/2024 11:46 PM] passiveaggressor
There's no folder called that


[2/13/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
I just... cant


[2/13/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
after you log in via ssh, you are in /root


[2/13/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
the kobo folder is in /kobo


[2/13/2024 11:48 PM] passiveaggressor
There's no folder called qt file I mean


[2/13/2024 11:50 PM] szybet
this is the qt file

@kobo I have tried getting this resolved with support for a month now. When will the linux kernel sources be released for the various revisions of the Kobo Libra 2. This is a violation of the GNU General Public License.

I w just realised tux Linux original one is 2 fps cap


[2/14/2024 8:40 PM] passiveaggressor
No wonder


[2/14/2024 8:42 PM] passiveaggressor
I read ur one, what your doing is pre processing and then sending screenshot


[2/14/2024 8:50 PM] szybet
yep


[2/14/2024 8:50 PM] szybet
and showing it using qt


[2/14/2024 8:50 PM] szybet
its really dumb, could be improved


[2/14/2024 8:51 PM] passiveaggressor
Does bigger screen need bigger processor?


[2/14/2024 8:51 PM] szybet
nope


[2/14/2024 8:51 PM] szybet
in my example the bottleneck was taking the screenshot and converting it


[2/14/2024 8:52 PM] passiveaggressor
No I mean for general use


[2/14/2024 8:52 PM] passiveaggressor

[2/14/2024 8:52 PM] szybet
elisa is just newer


[2/14/2024 8:52 PM] szybet

@tux-linux y did u for your kndv, limit fps to 2?


[2/14/2024 9:47 PM] passiveaggressor
Also does fbink determine which waveform is best when printing?


[2/14/2024 9:48 PM] szybet
a bit


[2/14/2024 9:49 PM] passiveaggressor

@Szybet can you write up detailed step by step instructions for the kobo screen mirror, also how do I force fbink to do partial update of image? Fbink - - help doesn't say much


[2/15/2024 8:23 PM] passiveaggressor
But in the code there is partial update I see it


[2/15/2024 8:24 PM] passiveaggressor
And I notice what you're doing scrot, and dither


[2/15/2024 8:25 PM] passiveaggressor
I wonder if find diff between two images and sending only the diff would help


[2/15/2024 8:25 PM] szybet
i have written it already


[2/15/2024 8:25 PM] szybet
you can summurise it and i will repair what you have written wrong

Also how come in your code I don't see any FBink commands?


[2/15/2024 8:28 PM] szybet
I use qt which uses qt platform plugin


[2/15/2024 8:29 PM] szybet
in platform plugin is fbink used


[2/15/2024 8:29 PM] szybet
and you shouldnt want to look there


[2/15/2024 8:29 PM] szybet
you wont understand anything and there is no reason to look there

Okay so I SCP kobo screen mirror reverse, which is now named qt frontend into the /kobo/kobo file


[2/15/2024 8:32 PM] passiveaggressor
And then run the chroot command in the kobo ssh shell


[2/15/2024 8:32 PM] szybet
you renamed the wrong file probably


[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
this is qt, oh actually its fine


[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] passiveaggressor
No I renamed it so it would be easier to remember which one is which the front end is 37kb

{Reactions}
👍 

[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
go on


[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] passiveaggressor
Run chroot in /kobo/kobo file


[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] passiveaggressor
Connect usbnet


[2/15/2024 8:33 PM] szybet
wrong


[2/15/2024 8:34 PM] passiveaggressor
Execute back end in the chroot Ed folder /kobo


[2/15/2024 8:34 PM] passiveaggressor
you propably need to rotate the screen via `echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate` something like that, maybe its 0 2 3 not 1, you need to try a few times


[2/15/2024 8:34 PM] passiveaggressor
before it kill inkbox with `killall inkbox inkbox-bin`


[2/15/2024 8:34 PM] passiveaggressor
Then ```
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/onboard/.adds/qt-linux-5.15.2-kobo/lib QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kobo ./thisappqt
```

May need to change file permissions to execute.


[2/15/2024 8:35 PM] passiveaggressor
At which point I start the host file using? Nothing it's a binary just run it


[2/15/2024 8:35 PM] szybet
`chroot /kobo`


[2/15/2024 8:35 PM] passiveaggressor
Yknow I was gonna pay you 10usd to get you to write an idiot proof instruction set but when I checked PayPal it was only tux liinux


[2/15/2024 8:35 PM] szybet
this is the command


[2/15/2024 8:36 PM] szybet
you could just ask me for it


[2/15/2024 8:36 PM] passiveaggressor
I see the qt platform fbink now


[2/15/2024 8:36 PM] szybet
well maybe later you can donate, not resolve this issue


[2/15/2024 8:37 PM] szybet
this command is correct


[2/15/2024 8:37 PM] passiveaggressor
So it's not chroot /kobo/kobo but chroot /kobo


[2/15/2024 8:37 PM] szybet
its not an ssh shell, you entered a different env


[2/15/2024 8:37 PM] passiveaggressor
Okay what's ur paypal


[2/15/2024 8:37 PM] szybet
yes


[2/15/2024 8:38 PM] szybet
accept pm


[2/15/2024 8:51 PM] tux_linux
you can send it to me and it will go to inkbox fund


[2/15/2024 8:52 PM] tux_linux
we have a fund to port new devices and stuff


[2/15/2024 8:52 PM] passiveaggressor
There's an 8 dollar fee for friends and family??


[2/15/2024 8:52 PM] tux_linux

[2/15/2024 8:52 PM] tux_linux
you dont have to if you dont want to


[2/15/2024 8:53 PM] szybet
yea whatever really, but he if he wants he can


[2/15/2024 8:53 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[2/15/2024 8:53 PM] szybet
make sure you send it in your currency and not in mine


[2/15/2024 8:53 PM] passiveaggressor
I also can't send usd I live in nz I didn't know that. Well I was going to do so as a carrot to get help, but I was getting help anyway so carrot be done


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] szybet
you dont need to send usd


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] szybet
send your currency


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] tux_linux
at your will
we always try to help when we can


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] szybet
whatever, your decission


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] tux_linux
with or without money


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] tux_linux
obviously


[2/15/2024 8:54 PM] tux_linux
otherwise this project wouldnt exist


[2/15/2024 8:55 PM] szybet
I could maybe find some time in weekend to add / change things in the mirror project if you wanted as a feature request for that donation


[2/15/2024 8:55 PM] passiveaggressor
No what I want is for the project to be noob friendly


[2/15/2024 8:55 PM] tux_linux
we understand


[2/15/2024 8:55 PM] szybet
hmm, the thing you are trying to do is in demo soo... yea

[2/15/2024 8:56 PM] szybet
you making docs is making it noob friendly, so thats cool


[2/15/2024 8:56 PM] tux_linux
but what do you want to do exactly


[2/15/2024 8:56 PM] tux_linux
is it the vnc thing


[2/15/2024 8:57 PM] tux_linux
yes


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Also consider that my thanks for all the help I've recieved so far


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
paypall arrived, yea thank you too


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
lets make the screen mirror work now ;p


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] passiveaggressor
Since it would save me from buying a 600nzd e ink monitor


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] szybet
yea


[2/15/2024 8:59 PM] tux_linux
maybe you will still want to buy it

[2/15/2024 9:00 PM] tux_linux
this is kinda fast


[2/15/2024 9:00 PM] tux_linux
and its a $800 eink tablet


[2/15/2024 9:00 PM] tux_linux
but still


[2/15/2024 9:00 PM] szybet
yes it's newer


[2/15/2024 9:01 PM] szybet
800 for a tablet or 600 for a screen


[2/15/2024 9:01 PM] szybet
thats my point


[2/15/2024 9:01 PM] szybet
whatever really


[2/15/2024 9:07 PM] passiveaggressor
The vnc that shipped with inkbox was blazing fast


[2/15/2024 9:07 PM] passiveaggressor
For my speeds


[2/15/2024 9:08 PM] szybet
~~the point of eink makes it not needed speeds~~


[2/15/2024 9:08 PM] passiveaggressor
I mean just to see the cursor moving around was enough, that's usable


[2/15/2024 9:09 PM] passiveaggressor
Also I'd rather buy an e ink monitor than a tablet, seems more useful that way


[2/15/2024 9:10 PM] szybet
a tablet can be a monitor anyway, but is still a tablet


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
hm ok


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
i think we might have different definitions of fast


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
but good if it suits you


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
did you know its touch as well


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
i think


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
im impressed you managed to connect


[2/15/2024 9:11 PM] tux_linux
i didnt even know if this thing was still working


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] szybet
it crashed 2 seconds after


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
not for me


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
oh for him


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
well, idk


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux
i used it on a touch n905b


[2/15/2024 9:12 PM] tux_linux

[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] passiveaggressor
Er wait about the fbink option b - - no refresh only update frame buffer don't e ink


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] passiveaggressor
Refresh e ink


[2/15/2024 9:13 PM] szybet
🧐


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Is that how you do fast partial updates? For me I thought I meant no refresh at all


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] tux_linux
i dont remember what that one does


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] szybet
what are you doing with fbink?


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] tux_linux
partial updates is only refreshing an area of the screen


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] passiveaggressor
It notes it's useful when batch drawing whatever that means


[2/15/2024 9:14 PM] passiveaggressor
I was tinkering with tux Linux es original 'vnc' viewer

nah, use mine


[2/15/2024 9:15 PM] passiveaggressor
I realised you capped fps at 2


[2/15/2024 9:15 PM] szybet
its better


[2/15/2024 9:15 PM] passiveaggressor
It probably is but the code there in tuxs I can understand

What causes fbink to error?


[2/15/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Is it because file has not been written yet?


[2/15/2024 11:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Or updating too fast and can't decode


[2/15/2024 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Probably


[2/15/2024 11:20 PM] tux_linux
Or both


[2/15/2024 11:30 PM] passiveaggressor

[2/15/2024 11:30 PM] passiveaggressor
Where is the 3rd kobo backend file supposed to go? Anywhere I'm guessing

At the end of the day I put both the qt file and kobo backend in the same kobo folder


[2/15/2024 11:43 PM] passiveaggressor
Which is kobo/kobo


[2/15/2024 11:43 PM] passiveaggressor
Couldn't scp it into the original one


[2/15/2024 11:55 PM] passiveaggressor
I'm again unsure which kobo file is supposed to be chrooted


[2/15/2024 11:55 PM] passiveaggressor
Becahse chroot /kobo chroot the kobo/kobo dir


[2/16/2024 12:05 AM] passiveaggressor
Okay extra instructions I didn't know was on the host machine you do ./file to execute it


[2/16/2024 12:10 AM] passiveaggressor
Okay to execute the kobo backend you also do. /

you just need to set a working url


[2/16/2024 2:35 PM] szybet
is that just http post json?


[2/16/2024 2:40 PM] tux_linux
pretty much


[2/16/2024 2:45 PM] szybet
I will rewrite it in rust


[2/16/2024 2:46 PM] szybet
before the next release


[2/16/2024 2:46 PM] tux_linux
ok

[2/16/2024 2:46 PM] tux_linux
just ensure it still works with inkbox code

what is this


[2/17/2024 12:58 AM] passiveaggressor
I had an idea, nickel menu add item, ssh pass into PC, start python server. Run bash loop, sshpass scrot file I.png, curl ip/'$i'.png, fbink i.png


[2/17/2024 12:59 AM] passiveaggressor
Solves the problem of the fbink failing bc of overwriting file, I think


[2/17/2024 1:00 AM] passiveaggressor
And Le process is started from the kobo rather than the pc


[2/17/2024 1:07 AM] szybet
rust ss library

I've been keeping a eye on it vaguely ever since I saw a mobileread thread for it


[2/17/2024 5:13 PM] tux_linux
We are two students


[2/17/2024 5:14 PM] tux_linux
So it's as active as we can make it


[2/17/2024 5:16 PM] mintpilo
With some loose contributions from others it seems? Or at least idk, it seems you guys have a healthy habit of urging people to contribute if they can from what I've seen


[2/17/2024 5:16 PM] tux_linux
Yes


[2/17/2024 5:16 PM] tux_linux
But we are mainly only two


[2/17/2024 5:16 PM] tux_linux

The kobo I use regularly isn't mine, and idk if I would want to tinker with a device that I want to like actually use


[2/17/2024 5:20 PM] mintpilo
If I were to consider my own, probably a clara 2e, though there isn't a port yet, but I've seen in a few places, here and the github that it was suggested that it's not too different from the nia model a? Might be an easy port?


[2/17/2024 5:21 PM] tux_linux
might


[2/17/2024 5:21 PM] mintpilo
Well yeah, that's *the* keyword


[2/17/2024 5:22 PM] mintpilo
I don't know much anyway, I know my way around Linux and I know how to compile a kernel


[2/17/2024 5:24 PM] mintpilo
Also as I understand the later kobo models have a soldered on micro sd, right?


[2/17/2024 5:25 PM] mintpilo
How does flashing that work, if necessary


[2/17/2024 5:29 PM] mintpilo
At least, the libra h20 does, the current model I use, but it isn't mine, though the person who is sharing it with me, my partner, also shares my curiosity, but I'd feel wrong poking around with this model particularly... and with the soldered storage, that might be a bit riskier


[2/17/2024 5:33 PM] tux_linux
It depends on the kobo


[2/17/2024 5:33 PM] tux_linux
Libra 2 has a microsd


[2/17/2024 5:33 PM] tux_linux
The install process for emmc models is somewhat complicated and dangerous

Hello ! I would like some infos on kobox as the link to download the nickel compatible version is down, I downloaded the other version. Does it not support nickel ? Can I build it myself to include nickel support ? Thanks !


[2/17/2024 8:20 PM] constoush
I wanted to use Koreader on it


[2/17/2024 8:26 PM] tux_linux
hi, sorry, inkbox doesnt support nickel since mid-2021 because it kind of outgrew the initial concepts i made it for
so it's a full operating system now


[2/17/2024 8:26 PM] tux_linux
you can install koreader on it


[2/17/2024 8:26 PM] tux_linux
closed-source nickel support is not really the point of an open-source os


[2/17/2024 8:27 PM] constoush

fine then, I will post it on reddit then


[2/18/2024 11:01 PM] passiveaggressor
Turns out fbink failed to decode was because the file didn't exist, not because it was too fast


[2/18/2024 11:10 PM] passiveaggressor
What's the secret sauce for high fps? Is it dithering on host, compression and usbnet working?


[2/18/2024 11:18 PM] szybet
All of them


[2/18/2024 11:19 PM] szybet
And with all of these you said, you will achieve something worse than my previous demo


[2/18/2024 11:19 PM] szybet
Because high speed communication and performance


[2/18/2024 11:20 PM] szybet
Im not creating any files, not calling any binaries but using libraries


[2/18/2024 11:22 PM] szybet
You, with calling fbink every time, or downloading the image every time is like smashing something with a hammer but every time you hit you go back to your garage and place the hammer on the shelf, return and pick it up again, then hit again

With the previous demo I was not closing the connection, now it's not calling any binaries, just using libraries so I'm hitting with the hammer faster because i dont return it every time


[2/18/2024 11:23 PM] szybet
I hope this explains it ;p


[2/18/2024 11:24 PM] szybet
Do you want still to try out mine?  I can still write a guide

But for now it's only good for video, not for text because dithering is not consistent

Hi! I can't get my Aura edition 2 v2 to boot, is this version supported or only v1?


[2/18/2024 11:39 PM] passiveaggressor
Yes, I'd still like to try it. No rush though, okay libraries eh ill look into what that means


[2/18/2024 11:41 PM] passiveaggressor
It is still slower than the vnc that came with inkbox though I think. The inkbox vnc mouse movements are really smooth comparatively


[2/18/2024 11:41 PM] szybet
Probably not supported. You can try to boot the stock os if he device still works

Apart from that, wait for tux lonux to answer you

Go to #quill too


[2/18/2024 11:43 PM] passiveaggressor
Are libraries faster than binaries because they are...? Loaded? They stay loaded? Is that what you mean


[2/18/2024 11:43 PM] szybet
Well yes, there are still a few things i could improve but unlikely to be done by me ( learn to code! )

Also the vnc might be better at smaller updates, but mine on bigger ones, hard to tell


[2/18/2024 11:43 PM] szybet
Yes


[2/18/2024 11:43 PM] passiveaggressor
Where do they live?


[2/18/2024 11:43 PM] szybet
Memory


[2/18/2024 11:44 PM] passiveaggressor
As opposed to binaries living in?


[2/18/2024 11:45 PM] passiveaggressor
Is the learn to code referring to yourself or me?


[2/18/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
On the disk, libraries live in ram

after a few calls the os will save the binary to ram but
Calling another binary is also costly because its calling another binary, so the os creates another process, checks permissions, the binary itself calculates what to do with the arguments, then it needs to read a file from tmpfs or read data from stdin which is also slower, allocate memory for something many times instead of once

many reasons for that


[2/18/2024 11:47 PM] szybet
You😄


[2/18/2024 11:50 PM] passiveaggressor

Hey, I joined the server after your answer to my question on Mobile read today


[3/1/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
oh that's you


[3/1/2024 10:59 PM] szybet
yea welcome


[3/1/2024 11:02 PM] nassimhammadou
Thank you
I might have a question actually if you don't mind, before I set up the development environment to try to develop something fun I thought I'd try first install the sanki app on my kobo, I downloaded the zip file from github and exctracted it to my kobo and it didn't work any idea why that would be the case? (I already have nickelMenu working fine)


[3/1/2024 11:03 PM] nassimhammadou
I got a kobo clara 2e


[3/1/2024 11:05 PM] szybet
didn't work as for: it doesnt appear to launch or the device burned down?


[3/1/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
precise descriptions :D...


[3/1/2024 11:06 PM] nassimhammadou
sure 
it seems that the kobo is just rebooting after launching the app


[3/1/2024 11:06 PM] szybet
this is the reason i dumped the stock os and joined inkbox to develop it


[3/1/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
because the stock os fucking hates custom apps no matter how many wizards try


[3/1/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
as for your problem: no idea, i mostly support inkbox, nickel should work but well you see


[3/1/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
some logs maybe could be gathered


[3/1/2024 11:07 PM] szybet
idk


[3/1/2024 11:08 PM] nassimhammadou
just to make sure, I need to download the sanki_nickel.zip
file from here, and extract the content to my kobo device and it should work fine right? no installation or command needed


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
yep


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
you need to have koreader pack installed


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
kfmon, nickel menu etc


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] szybet
if it appeared in menu and after launching it reboots something is really wrong


[3/1/2024 11:09 PM] nassimhammadou
Ok I'll try and figure out the problem and see if it works


[3/1/2024 11:10 PM] szybet
get a shell working


[3/1/2024 11:11 PM] nassimhammadou
Thanks, I'm new to the kobo environment so I'm trying to play with it


[3/1/2024 11:12 PM] szybet
do you want to develop apps, share it with the community as for love for open source and penguins and be serious about it or just games for the joke™


[3/1/2024 11:15 PM] nassimhammadou
If I succeed in setting up the dev environment and get things working fine I'll make sure to share my apps x))

haha... the still didn't fixed the sleep reasons why i switched to inkbox


[3/2/2024 8:53 PM] passiveaggressor
Could you upload a demo of the vnc on inkbox? Also, so you have any clue how I could remove the e ink panel from the backplate? I broke my screen when opening the kobo to replace the button. Ha. Unlike other kobo, the entire surface of the display is black taped to the plate.

One method I thought of:use suction to hold plat flare to surface. Then heat the back until glue very soft. This should keep the backplate bent. Otherwise thus til now I've been snapping pieces of glass off and then bending the bacj


[3/2/2024 8:54 PM] passiveaggressor
The reason I want you to upload a demo is so I can see what vnc looks like on other machines as I don't think you did vnc in your demo on yt rn


[3/2/2024 9:08 PM] szybet
Which vnc

What? Photos please

How... How... I removed the pcb on a nia without a issue

Look at some kindle repairs ( hughe jeffrays done one ) its a messy process


[3/2/2024 9:11 PM] passiveaggressor
The xorg one


[3/2/2024 9:12 PM] passiveaggressor
Yea idk Ive opened my kobo up many times no issue. I must have bent up a corner


[3/2/2024 9:12 PM] passiveaggressor
Of the display while working around


[3/2/2024 9:13 PM] szybet
I didnt created my solution because the xorg one was bad - it was simply not working

poor kobo


[3/2/2024 9:14 PM] passiveaggressor
Yea I have those too. Prices of used and new are about add 50 nzd, or 30usd so repair stoll worth


[3/2/2024 9:14 PM] passiveaggressor
No no b4 I only cracked a corner


[3/2/2024 9:15 PM] passiveaggressor
The reason it looks so bad is


[3/2/2024 9:15 PM] passiveaggressor
The removal process is very unfriendly


[3/2/2024 9:16 PM] passiveaggressor
It was still usable I just hated the fact a corner was damaged and made the rest of the screen somewhat u contrasty


[3/2/2024 9:16 PM] szybet
Why did you dissasemble it?


[3/2/2024 9:16 PM] passiveaggressor
Was it not working for you as well?

[3/2/2024 9:16 PM] szybet

[3/2/2024 9:16 PM] szybet
You could try to repair it🥴


[3/2/2024 9:17 PM] passiveaggressor
Yea if I can figure out a clean way to do so I'll make an ifixit guide, otherwise my other idea is to just make a new backplate


[3/2/2024 9:17 PM] szybet
Backplate?


[3/2/2024 9:17 PM] szybet
You mean the plastic?


[3/2/2024 9:18 PM] passiveaggressor
No it's a metal backplate


[3/2/2024 9:18 PM] szybet
I would call it the frontplate


[3/2/2024 9:18 PM] passiveaggressor
The thing that the battery is stuck to that one


[3/2/2024 9:19 PM] szybet
@tux-linux have you send the email


[3/3/2024 1:27 AM] passiveaggressor
Yea heating it doesn't help. I'm just gonna make a new plate


[3/3/2024 1:31 AM] passiveaggressor
As I heated up the screen, the top layer disintegrated, dyu think theres any toxic stuff in e ink? After all it's just ink right...


[3/3/2024 1:31 AM] passiveaggressor

Afaik its magnetic dust that has different colors on each side. The screen then generates an electric field to flip the dust particles around to change the color.

filled with fluid and coloured , electrically charged particles of different size depending on the eink display


[3/4/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius
rest is fluid mechanics


[3/4/2024 7:25 PM] kuratius

So I found a Aura 2e and a glo at the thrift store. which is the better for inkbox?


[3/4/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux

glo


[3/4/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux

sorry


[3/4/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux
for the aura, what is the model number


[3/4/2024 10:35 PM] tux_linux
we only support aura n236


[3/4/2024 10:35 PM] destineternel
n236


[3/4/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux
well, then your choice


[3/4/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux
n236 may be subject to some usb port issues


[3/4/2024 10:36 PM] tux_linux

I can completely understand your intuition and I'm very pleased with the thought process (which shows once again how much you love your project). No matter what the name ends up being, I would make a note that this project used to be called Inkbox and that the name was changed in the course of development. It will then probably be possible to find the project even if the name is changed.


[3/17/2024 10:37 PM] [matrix] Szybet

[3/17/2024 10:43 PM] [matrix] 🐉鈴
But BlinkOS is still the wrong way to go. This name somehow reminds me of an Android custom rom. 

How about a name that conveys something with "paper" or "paperless" and as a logo you could maybe use something "modern" like an origami.

My comments are meant more as inspiration. You have to come up with a name that you both like. Nobody lets strangers choose the name of their own child

Clever E-Ink Driver Does 32 Levels Of Grey, Avoids Update Flicker, ...

[3/24/2024 4:55 PM] kuratius
Nice


[3/24/2024 5:28 PM] kuratius
actually I think he's interpolating the grey levels wrong


[3/24/2024 5:34 PM] szybet
In my opinion he just discovered waveform modes that were undocumented by the manufacturer because it damages the display over time / was very lazy


[3/24/2024 5:34 PM] szybet
probably the 2


[3/24/2024 5:35 PM] kuratius
read the documentation, he generates a custom LUT/waveform


[3/24/2024 5:35 PM] kuratius
I think he linearly interpolates the black/white luts xD


[3/24/2024 5:36 PM] szybet
he recalibrates the display?


[3/24/2024 5:36 PM] kuratius
he sends the display new LUTs to use


[3/24/2024 5:36 PM] kuratius
existing drivers already need to send the LUTs but nobody had the balls to modify them


[3/24/2024 5:37 PM] kuratius
because the display chip doesnt actually understand gray levels, anything with more than 4 levels is done by sending new LUTs multiple times and doing a new refresh


[3/24/2024 5:38 PM] kuratius
if you want 32 gray levels you have to do like 8 refreshes


[3/24/2024 5:38 PM] kuratius
he's basically using ghosting


[3/24/2024 5:38 PM] szybet
so it's interesting after all


[3/24/2024 5:39 PM] kuratius
I mean it's exactly what I suggested before


[3/24/2024 5:39 PM] kuratius
so I'm happy someone else did the work for me

Would it be difficult to add greyscale? · Issue #5 · 9names/uc8151-...
It seems that the LUTs can be modified, and to my understanding greyscale is just a very advanced type of ghosting. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_UC8151D/blob/main/adafruit_uc8...

Maybe you could add it to te watchy


[3/24/2024 5:45 PM] kuratius
Have you seen anything that looks like configurable LUTs on the watchy?


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] szybet
i dont know what LUT is


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] szybet
its a SPI interface


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] szybet
so that could be the problem


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] kuratius
Look Up Table


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] szybet
so a waveform?


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] kuratius
yes


[3/24/2024 5:46 PM] kuratius
same thing


[3/24/2024 5:47 PM] kuratius
Have you seen the waveforms being stored on the watchy?


[3/24/2024 5:47 PM] kuratius
in some file or other?


[3/24/2024 5:47 PM] kuratius
if yes then the driver relies on sending them, and you only need to know where to tweak voltage


[3/24/2024 5:48 PM] kuratius
if not then you have to pray that the interface between CPU and display supports commands for sending LUTs


[3/24/2024 5:50 PM] szybet
nope


[3/24/2024 5:50 PM] szybet
idk


[3/24/2024 5:50 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/25/2024 2:02 AM] kuratius
if you know the exact display you could check if this guy already supports it or one of its cousins 

it's one of the good display ones, but the example code for it was deleted from their site/the link in the sqfmi source code is outdated

Hi!  I just found my Kobo Aura (N236) and I'd like to try inkbox/quillOS on it..  I see the instructions say to do "xzcat inkbox.xz | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0".  However - only the kobo aura, there is no removeable SD (that i'm aware of) - just internal memory.  So when I plug it in, I just get /dev/sdc device node.  I backed up everything on there with "dd if=/dev/sdc | xz > kobo-backup.img.xz" but I want to just double check - how do I install on a kobo with internal memory like this?


[3/26/2024 1:24 PM] prg4ever
I'm really excited to try this out and I'm so happy I actually found this thing in between the seat of my car and the center console after losing it over 2 years lol

Ah okay. i was wondering that but didnt open it yet


[3/26/2024 1:36 PM] prg4ever

This is pineflash, it's for automatically downloading and updating ironos firmware


[3/26/2024 2:48 PM] spagettioso
I reckon it could probably be adapted for quillos (well a lot of it could be simplified since writing data to an SD card is more simple)


[3/26/2024 2:48 PM] spagettioso
It automatically gets the latest release from GitHub


[3/26/2024 2:49 PM] spagettioso
Obviously people who know what they are doing wouldn't need something like this, the current installation isn't hard

But maybe it could lower the barrier to entry a bit?


[3/26/2024 2:51 PM] spagettioso
Maybe also have a feature which makes a backup of the stock firmware on the SD card.


[3/26/2024 2:51 PM] spagettioso
Do you guys think something like this would be helpful or a waste of time?


[3/26/2024 2:58 PM] spagettioso
It could probably also be expanded to automatically resize the data partition if it's a bigger sd card or install user apps


[3/26/2024 3:02 PM] prg4ever
If i would have known that these Kobo's have an SD card on the inside, I think the instructions would have been straightforward for me.  But when I saw something about SD card, I incorrectly was thinking that some models might have an SD card on the outside and maybe mine was different and had different instructions - so I wanted to ask in discord into clarify.  And I wanted to be double sure I was doing the right thing because I didn't want to brick


[3/26/2024 3:03 PM] spagettioso
Yeah when I first installed inkbox I was surprised that the internal storage was an SD card


[3/26/2024 3:04 PM] spagettioso
Especially since mine also had a slot on the outside for one


[3/26/2024 3:10 PM] prg4ever
I'm having a self inflicted issue right now - I mistakenly didn't fully power off my kobo before removing the SD and now it's stuck "asleep" in stock OS (the black "Powered off" screen).. Holding down the power 15 seconds actually isn't forcing a reboot.. I know I can pull the battery, but the connector is so small and tightly connected that I think I'm gonna just wait for the battery to die


[3/26/2024 3:10 PM] spagettioso
Look around the edges for a little hole


[3/26/2024 3:11 PM] spagettioso
Idk if your model has one but I assume it should


[3/26/2024 3:11 PM] spagettioso
Something you can stick a pin into


[3/26/2024 3:13 PM] prg4ever
The N236 actually doesn't have a pin hole


[3/26/2024 3:15 PM] spagettioso
Oh, rip


[3/26/2024 3:16 PM] prg4ever
Yeah it's all good.. Once the battery dies, I should be fine

I planned to do that at some time anyway but as you can see there is none yet because too much work in other areas, but you could do that for sure


[3/26/2024 3:29 PM] szybet
what? look for other buttons and push them for a minute or even more


[3/26/2024 3:29 PM] szybet
there must be a power off button ;p


[3/26/2024 3:30 PM] szybet
also expanding on this


[3/26/2024 3:38 PM] szybet
it is possible to flash inkbox os without dissasembling the device, the process would look like this:
- a desktop app uploads a update package to the kobo which is connected via usb mass storage
- an app appears on your kobo, you launch it and verify the informations, then click "continue" or smth
- you upload via wifi a backup of the whole sd card to the PC ( or share the sd card over usb, idk what's possible )
- the app flashes the kernel & uboot and reboots the device
- the kernel, not detecting other partitions enters "recovery / install mode" ( if thats not possible on all devices, you just partition the sd card manually ( or do it in the previous step in the stock os app )
- in this mode either the host apps prepares the sd card OR the init program downloads the via http over usbnet from the app on the PC which launches a http server
- after everything is in place inkbox is ready

if the installer / program / init did any of these steps installing Quill OS would be easier. Here is the fun part: every step of this journey should be written in rust, I plan to rewrite the init program in rust anyway and because we don't need any fancy UI for this we can do that with rust & fbink


[3/26/2024 3:42 PM] spagettioso
I mean I can recycle a ton of code from pineflash so it shouldn't take too long (I do want to rewrite some of it though since there are parts of pineflash coded very shodily)


[3/26/2024 3:42 PM] tux_linux
it looks like a cool tool


[3/26/2024 3:43 PM] tux_linux
our os can currently already update itself


[3/26/2024 3:43 PM] tux_linux
but maybe for new installs


[3/26/2024 3:43 PM] spagettioso
Cool, that part wouldn't be needed then


[3/26/2024 3:44 PM] spagettioso
Would an app uploaded to the Kobo (running the stock os) have enough permissions to flash the kernel and uboot?


[3/26/2024 3:44 PM] spagettioso
I would have assumed they would sandbox stuff like that


[3/26/2024 3:47 PM] szybet
everything on kobo is running as root


[3/26/2024 3:47 PM] szybet
😂


[3/26/2024 3:47 PM] szybet
no, we do that in user apps at least


[3/26/2024 3:47 PM] prg4ever
Weirdly enough, there only appears to be one power button and it wasn't responding.. I reflashed my stock SD card backup to another SD card and once I inserted it, the power button started working again.. I think its because stock OS was booted but in a bad state because I pulled the SD while it was on and I didn't realize.. I've got it working now - once I was able to fully power off, I swapped SDs and powered back on and everything is groovy 🙂


[3/26/2024 3:48 PM] szybet
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[3/26/2024 3:48 PM] prg4ever
Yeah i think it was user error 😛


[3/26/2024 3:49 PM] spagettioso
Wow, I know it's an ereader and everything but wow


[3/26/2024 3:49 PM] spagettioso
That is the least secure system Ive ever heard of


[3/26/2024 3:50 PM] szybet
Its open


[3/26/2024 3:50 PM] szybet
Not unsecure


[3/26/2024 3:50 PM] spagettioso
Im not saying they should take that away


[3/26/2024 3:51 PM] spagettioso
But some sort of sudo/password thing may have been a good idea


[3/26/2024 3:51 PM] szybet
Mupdf is secure, they do sudits of it so no malware books


[3/26/2024 3:51 PM] szybet
And the ui is written in cpp, so no reverse shell shit like php or smth


[3/26/2024 3:52 PM] szybet
The update could be signed but who would like to malware ereaders? Until they hold their domain tight its fine


[3/26/2024 3:53 PM] spagettioso
Yeah that's fair


[3/26/2024 3:53 PM] spagettioso
And I must say it's refreshing


[3/26/2024 3:54 PM] spagettioso
Compared with devices like phones which don't even allow the user to have root access


[3/26/2024 3:54 PM] spagettioso
(some do and I have It on mine but I'm speaking generally)


[3/26/2024 3:55 PM] szybet
Yea, its awesome


[3/26/2024 3:58 PM] spagettioso
In that case I'm thinking, we could just make the desktop app deploy the payload and receive the backup


[3/26/2024 3:58 PM] szybet
ye


[3/26/2024 4:02 PM] spagettioso
Do Kobo devices advertise their model via their USB ID or some similar factor when in mass storage?


[3/26/2024 4:02 PM] spagettioso
Cause we could get it to autodetect the device


[3/26/2024 4:03 PM] spagettioso
Then people don't need to bother with the model number/remembering which one they bought


[3/26/2024 4:05 PM] szybet
doubt, you would need a internall app for this


[3/26/2024 4:05 PM] spagettioso
Hmm righto


[3/26/2024 4:05 PM] szybet
but


[3/26/2024 4:05 PM] szybet
the kobo app on pc somehow does that


[3/26/2024 4:05 PM] szybet
maybe undocumented usb something magic idk


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] spagettioso
Well, when I plug my phone into my PC dmesg shows it accurately as a pixel 4


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] szybet
idk must be tested


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] spagettioso
Certainly


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] szybet
we would still need to know the specific model, like revision


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] spagettioso
Yeah


[3/26/2024 4:06 PM] szybet
like there is kobo nia a and c and the only way to test that is to ask over i2c


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] spagettioso
I wonder if their product ID USB field is different


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] tux_linux
did you know on iphone original the whole system was running as root, including apps


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] szybet
awesome


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] spagettioso
That's cool


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] tux_linux
quill is running as root, but highly difficult to exploit a security flaw


[3/26/2024 4:07 PM] szybet
huh, that may be it


[3/26/2024 4:08 PM] szybet
is usb id set on hardware level?


[3/26/2024 4:08 PM] spagettioso
I think so


[3/26/2024 4:08 PM] tux_linux
if anyone here is good with pentesting, we would be happy to hear from you


[3/26/2024 4:09 PM] szybet
we dont do anything with networking


[3/26/2024 4:09 PM] spagettioso
Well maybe not hardware but firmware at least, not certain


[3/26/2024 4:09 PM] szybet
hmm maybe yea


[3/26/2024 4:09 PM] spagettioso
It's something that will need testing

So technically the commands for it are documented, idk if they work


[3/26/2024 6:11 PM] kuratius
steps: 

1.download micropython example from the goodereader site
2. Test micropython example on watchy
3. modify micropython example with custom commands to load LUTs


[3/26/2024 6:12 PM] kuratius
if 2. fails then probably look at sqfmi driver code and see how it matches the documented communication

Hello everyone,
Can I use InkBOX os on kobo aura one?


[3/28/2024 11:48 AM] szybet
only Kobo Aura SE (N236 is supported


[3/28/2024 11:49 AM] szybet
you could port if you have time and will


[3/28/2024 11:49 AM] nec94
How can I do that? Is there any documentation or guidance?


[3/28/2024 11:51 AM] szybet
a lot of chat of doing it in #porting


[3/28/2024 11:51 AM] szybet
and docs are also there, in the chat


[3/28/2024 11:54 AM] nec94
Thank you, I'll check


[3/28/2024 2:03 PM] kuratius
Quick update on the eink stuff: The guy who wrote the badger eink driver probably doesn't have greyscale calibrated right, but I think he has the same issue as the sqfmi watchy in that the voltage cannot be changed continuously (only 4 levels available), meaning that if that problem is solved correctly (solving for time that a voltage needs to be applied ) the result can be reused for the watchy with relatively little work.


[3/28/2024 2:03 PM] kuratius
this is his "greyscale gradient", you can see that it probably has quantization issues and isnt very smooth

Other than the n873

Ah, thats the n249? Seems that the wiki doesnt list it but the download directory does


[4/2/2024 10:23 PM] tux_linux
yes


[4/2/2024 10:23 PM] notaustinfrompa
N249 looks great for me. Similar to the boox poke 5 that i had before

More to think about then. I see in an earlier post you wouldnt recommend the libra n873?


[4/2/2024 10:40 PM] notaustinfrompa
Also, im guessing newer ereaders have the hardware locked down so flashing custom os is less possible?

No, they are just more expensive so no one tried yet
