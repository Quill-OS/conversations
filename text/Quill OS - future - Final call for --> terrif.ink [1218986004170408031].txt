Not to beat a dead horse here (because I understand that Blink OS is closing in as a final contender)... But I REALLY like this terrif.ink one (although I'm not entirely impartial - because I'm responsible for coming up with it.) Besides looking nice and modern, it plays well with the domain hosting as relates to brand identity as well - since there is an .ink TLD

With that being said... I can also see the wisdom of deciding on something with a degree of finality ASAP... so Blink OS makes just as much sense - since it would settle the issue and allow for moving on to other stuff.

IMO different domain name shouldn't be a problem

the word "terrifying" in regards to inkbox makes only sense as for the porting process ~~for some devices~~ / kobo & NXP kernel coding ;p
