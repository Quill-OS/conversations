@Free Radical here will be the place where we can start to port InkBox OS to a Touch A.


[5/3/2022 3:55 AM] a.free.radical
awesome!


[5/3/2022 3:55 AM] tux_linux
I suggest you try InkBox OS on your Touch B before and try to get some basics


[5/3/2022 3:56 AM] a.free.radical
yeah
thats the plan, just downloading it bnow

[5/3/2022 3:56 AM] tux_linux
Do you have access to a serial console?


[5/3/2022 3:56 AM] a.free.radical
serial console?


[5/3/2022 3:56 AM] tux_linux
do you have a raspberry pi?


[5/3/2022 3:57 AM] a.free.radical
yes! (kind of, its complicated)


[5/3/2022 3:57 AM] tux_linux
or maybe you can use one of your kobos as the serial host


[5/3/2022 3:57 AM] tux_linux
but is the raspi gpio usable?


[5/3/2022 3:57 AM] a.free.radical
it is not... its at a family members house for the next few weeks


[5/3/2022 3:58 AM] a.free.radical
i only have vnc access


[5/3/2022 3:58 AM] tux_linux
Ok, we will use a Kobo then


[5/3/2022 3:58 AM] a.free.radical
alrighty then


[5/3/2022 3:58 AM] tux_linux
Pop open the Kobo in the worst physical state you have


[5/3/2022 3:58 AM] tux_linux
you have three A's, right?


[5/3/2022 3:59 AM] a.free.radical
what if the battery does not work?


[5/3/2022 3:59 AM] a.free.radical
will that be okay?


[5/3/2022 3:59 AM] tux_linux
no problem


[5/3/2022 3:59 AM] tux_linux
it powers on?


[5/3/2022 3:59 AM] a.free.radical
hmmm
let me double check that


[5/3/2022 4:01 AM] a.free.radical
i think it'll need an hour to charge...


[5/3/2022 4:02 AM] tux_linux
well you can take another one
we won't destroy it anyway


[5/3/2022 4:02 AM] a.free.radical
most of them are dead tbh (got them the other day)


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] tux_linux
but then why did you want to install inkbox on them?


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] a.free.radical
because I have no use for 5 regular e readers


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] a.free.radical
OH dead battery


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] tux_linux
but at what level are they dead?


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] a.free.radical
not charged


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] tux_linux
ok


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] a.free.radical
needing charge


[5/3/2022 4:03 AM] tux_linux
no problem, touch and minis can work without battery, only with usb cable


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] a.free.radical
oh?


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] a.free.radical
on second thought... i may only have 2 kobos


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] tux_linux
but some touches are complicated to get working without a battery


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] a.free.radical
what does this mean?


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] tux_linux
do you have a multimeter?


[5/3/2022 4:04 AM] a.free.radical
no 😦


[5/3/2022 4:05 AM] tux_linux
or voltmeter


[5/3/2022 4:05 AM] tux_linux
ok


[5/3/2022 4:05 AM] a.free.radical
man, we havent even started the porting and this has become complicated enough, so sorry


[5/3/2022 4:06 AM] tux_linux
you don't want to do it?


[5/3/2022 4:06 AM] a.free.radical
no i do!


[5/3/2022 4:06 AM] tux_linux
oh ok


[5/3/2022 4:06 AM] a.free.radical
just trying not to be burdedsome


[5/3/2022 4:06 AM] tux_linux
i've seen more complicated


[5/3/2022 4:07 AM] tux_linux
and we're only getting started
take a peek at the sony prs-t1 porting thread to see what nightmare we could be facing later


[5/3/2022 4:07 AM] a.free.radical
well i appreciate your patience

[5/3/2022 4:09 AM] a.free.radical
does the blue light mean it works? (even if it doesnt power on?)


[5/3/2022 4:09 AM] tux_linux
it powers on


[5/3/2022 4:09 AM] tux_linux
and no, it doesn't work


[5/3/2022 4:09 AM] tux_linux
but there might be hope


[5/3/2022 4:09 AM] tux_linux
for that you need a serial console


[5/3/2022 4:10 AM] a.free.radical

[5/3/2022 4:10 AM] a.free.radical
This is the ideal kobo to use as a serial console


[5/3/2022 4:11 AM] a.free.radical
do ya think it would work?


[5/3/2022 4:11 AM] tux_linux
yes?
but if it can power on (boot the system, I mean)


[5/3/2022 4:13 AM] a.free.radical
hmmmm, its not exactly behaving
i think i'll bite the bullet and use a different kobo


[5/3/2022 4:24 AM] tux_linux
https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4185784&postcount=11
This could be something to do (for Touch A)
But I think there is another way without shorting any connection

is this for serial or battery? (im guessing serial, just being sure)


[5/3/2022 4:25 AM] tux_linux
serial


[5/3/2022 4:28 AM] a.free.radical
wow this is intense
the touch b is just flashing the file you linked to the sd card yeah?


[5/3/2022 4:29 AM] tux_linux
yes


[5/3/2022 4:30 AM] a.free.radical
i think ill flash the sd card for the B tonight then, head to bed and come back at this tmr

👍 

[5/3/2022 4:53 AM] a.free.radical
ive flashed the sd card
do i just insert it and hit the reset button on the back with a paperclip?


[5/3/2022 4:54 AM] tux_linux
did you open the kobo?
you're supposed to replace the **internal** sd card


[5/3/2022 4:54 AM] a.free.radical
internal???


[5/3/2022 4:54 AM] a.free.radical
ohhhhhh


[5/3/2022 4:54 AM] a.free.radical
ok ok


[5/3/2022 4:55 AM] a.free.radical
how do i pull off the back?


[5/3/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
credit card


[5/3/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
maybe a knife then a credit card


[5/3/2022 4:56 AM] a.free.radical
got it


[5/3/2022 4:56 AM] tux_linux
or something like a credit card


[5/3/2022 4:58 AM] a.free.radical
do i put it in sleep?


[5/3/2022 4:58 AM] a.free.radical
or pwoer off?


[5/3/2022 4:58 AM] a.free.radical
how to power off? i guess is my question


[5/3/2022 4:59 AM] tux_linux
slide power button for a long time


[5/3/2022 5:01 AM] a.free.radical
how do you pull out the sd card? its pretty wedged in there


[5/3/2022 5:01 AM] tux_linux
slide the sd card holder to the left or right, don't recall, then lift it up, it rotates

@emulti here


[2/17/2023 6:06 PM] emulti_
yes will be in touch when serial cable arrives and is installed. Could be a few days


[2/17/2023 6:06 PM] szybet
im not sure about the uart voltage for this model


[2/17/2023 6:06 PM] szybet
be aware


[2/17/2023 6:06 PM] szybet
propably 3.3


[2/21/2023 4:43 AM] emulti_
I am also guessing 3.3. Not easy to find here, there is no eBay. It's coming from China.


[2/21/2023 4:44 AM] emulti_
A question about Inkbox: does the signing infrastructure mean that I can only run packages signed by the original developers? And can't modify the root filesystem at all unless signed by same?


[2/21/2023 6:28 AM] szybet
No, you can use your own keys


[2/21/2023 6:31 AM] szybet
And you can install alpine packages just fine


[2/21/2023 6:32 AM] szybet
Or even modify the filesystem


[2/21/2023 6:32 AM] szybet
( with root edition of inkbox ), the regular user edition protects this


[2/21/2023 6:33 AM] szybet
Signing is only for updates, to verify they are valid


[2/22/2023 4:04 AM] tux_linux
You can disable signature verification almost completely with a developer key
I need to write a wiki page about this


[2/22/2023 4:26 AM] emulti_
It seems I could be out of luck: Kobo have not published the u-boot source code for the early N905 with internal EMMC and AR6003 Wifi like mine. Only "later Touch models".  This could also explain the non-working wifi.


[2/22/2023 4:26 AM] tux_linux
You have every right to ask for it

[2/22/2023 4:33 AM] emulti_
Have opened an issue requesting kernel and u-boot source code.


[2/22/2023 4:35 AM] emulti_
The folder you linked is for "... newer Touch".


[2/22/2023 4:36 AM] emulti_
I suppose they will confirm if it's also for the earlier model. It's not clear to me in the u-boot Makefile which config to use.


[2/22/2023 4:44 AM] emulti_
I can try building with imx50_rdp_config. What Toolchain do you recommend to use?


[2/22/2023 11:34 AM] szybet
arm-linux-gnueabihf from kernel repo


[2/23/2023 4:33 AM] emulti_
Sources apparently from hw/imx508/cls folder. There are several mx51_product_trilogy_defconfig with different hardware configs especially wifi. Only one builds the ar6000.ko module so I guess it's that one.  There seems to be no HWCONFIG record on this model (that part of the storage image is all 0x00) and the partitions start at 32768. So I don't understand how the kernel and u-boot find out what hardware is connected. There is no DTB?


[2/23/2023 4:35 AM] tux_linux
DTB is how we do things today
Here we are in prehistoric times


[2/23/2023 10:17 AM] emulti_
.config looks sane , but
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf
gives:


[2/23/2023 10:17 AM] emulti_

Weird


[2/23/2023 10:37 AM] szybet
You use the one from inkbox kernel repo?


[2/23/2023 10:37 AM] szybet
Hmmm try other toolchains then


[2/23/2023 10:03 PM] tux_linux
Ctrl+Shift+C in terminal maybe ?

Sorry I just jumped in haha


[2/24/2023 2:52 AM] emulti_
other toolchains from Inkbox kernel repo also fail during compilation. The one that got furthest was arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf-  which dies with 
  CC      kernel/itimer.o
  TIMEC   kernel/timeconst.h
Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?) at kernel/timeconst.pl line 373.

make: *** [Makefile:884: kernel] Error 2

 I will try some from the Koboreader repo. Guess I need a toolchain of similar age to the kernel source (12 years!)


[2/24/2023 2:55 AM] emulti_
I wonder if this is a waste of time. Maybe better to try and generate a DTB ( found one online for the original 2012 Aura which is quite similar in some ways to the Touch) and try a more recent kernel. Steep learning curve for me on that but may be worth it.

thanks! on we go


[2/24/2023 3:27 AM] emulti_
OK that works now to add usb networking support so I can at least get into the thing without wifi


[2/24/2023 3:41 AM] tux_linux
use serial port instead?


[2/24/2023 3:44 AM] emulti_
cable not here yet. 
Why when I enable usb ethernet gadget support and save the .config does make uImage force me to start line-by-line configuration from scratch?


[2/24/2023 4:14 AM] emulti_
nvm, I started again from scratch and it built including the g_ether.ko that is missing from my device.


[2/24/2023 7:06 AM] szybet
I dont remember, you meed to clean often / specofy the arch always


[3/1/2023 3:42 PM] szybet
Still waiting for serial connector?


[3/2/2023 1:10 PM] szybet
Dont die bro


[3/5/2023 2:55 AM] emulti_
Got the cable now I just need the time to solder it in. In the meantime have been experimenting with kernel options and Buildroot.
