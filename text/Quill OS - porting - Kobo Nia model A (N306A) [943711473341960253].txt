@Szybet , here's a porting thread to get your Nia set up properly. I usually don't have much time for InkBox except on week-ends, but you can checkout the Libra H2O porting thread to have an idea of what will need to be done.


[2/17/2022 4:34‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
I do not know if @andi has done anything with mx6ull yet (Nia's SoC), but it sure could be interesting to have mainline there too, if it's not too much work.


[2/17/2022 8:26‚ÄØAM] szybet
I have already the backup of the SD card


[2/17/2022 8:26‚ÄØAM] szybet
i dont understand the openssl thing that was there talked about


[2/17/2022 8:26‚ÄØAM] szybet
i will get to u-boot today


[2/17/2022 8:27‚ÄØAM] szybet
and it would be great to make a 5.x kernel work


[2/17/2022 12:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/initrd/common/overlay-mount
Maybe look here, it's how the rootfs is verified and mounted at boot (it's a squashfs archive)

[2/17/2022 3:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm i understand the script


[2/17/2022 3:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
but i dont know how it could help


[2/17/2022 3:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
How what could help?


[2/17/2022 3:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
this


[2/17/2022 4:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
lets focus on the kernel / bootloader first?


[2/17/2022 4:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
or there doesnt need to be anything changed in them?


[2/17/2022 5:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Um yeah


[2/17/2022 5:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
U-Boot kernel sector
Change it to 81920
And change kernel load size to 18432


[2/17/2022 5:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm why is it needed to change?


[2/17/2022 5:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
so i need to compile u-boot?


[2/17/2022 5:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
and, is it all?


[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Kernel is too big


[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
why is it too big?


[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Do something like this https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/commit/a6754443ad14f9033d7e328426c9ad4451f516b7

[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot would change that it would be big?


[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It can't fit in the default unpartitioned space


[2/17/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Initrd is embedded


[2/17/2022 5:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
it would be better to understand if you would provide the full sd card partition / place plan


[2/17/2022 5:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Download factory image and look


[2/17/2022 5:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
23.163.0.39


[2/17/2022 5:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
where is it


[2/17/2022 5:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
and, maybe we try to update the kernel to a newer version?


[2/17/2022 6:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
See here for example
http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/n905b/inkbox-1.7-n905b.xz


[2/17/2022 6:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will look at it


[2/17/2022 7:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
how do i generate the u-boot config?


[2/17/2022 7:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
or even get the board name


[2/17/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
```
inkbox-1.7-n905b: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0x2,140,10), end-CHS (0x4,247,51), startsector 40959, 38913 sectors; partition 2 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0x6,127,58), end-CHS (0x46,61,55), startsector 104448, 1024000 sectors; partition 3 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0x46,61,56), end-CHS (0x56,142,56), startsector 1128448, 262144 sectors; partition 4 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0x56,142,57), end-CHS (0x1d5,242,17), startsector 1390592, 6159156 sectors
```


[2/17/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
i used file to show this


[2/17/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to mount this, or use another app to open this?


[2/17/2022 7:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
the easiest and fastest way would be if you shared resources / links how to do those steps


[2/17/2022 7:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe write a guide / documentation?


[2/17/2022 7:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
fdisk img


[2/17/2022 7:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or xzcat img > InkBox.img


[2/17/2022 7:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
losetup -P -f --show InkBox.img


[2/17/2022 7:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
fdisk -l /dev/loop<x>


[2/17/2022 7:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I don't know the kernel sources or U-Boot sources for this model, but look in `include/configs` for U-Boot


[2/17/2022 7:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe `imx_v7_defconfig`


[2/17/2022 7:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats whot i thought, that i need to mount it


[2/17/2022 7:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
ok i will have a look at it

Maybe you can set up the emulator in a Debian VM to have an idea of what you will be dealing with

this looks promising


[2/18/2022 1:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What filename?


[2/18/2022 1:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
auto.conf


[2/18/2022 1:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Doubt it will work


[2/18/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
it isin't there


[2/18/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
but i have a idea


[2/18/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
the cpu is mx6ull


[2/18/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/18/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] szybet

[2/18/2022 5:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
How much RAM do you have in the Nia?


[2/18/2022 5:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait, i will check


[2/18/2022 5:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
RAMType='LPDDR2


[2/18/2022 5:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
RamSize='256MB'


[2/18/2022 5:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
so its only
```
mx6ull_ntx_lpddr2_256m_defconfig
mx6ull_ntx_lpddr2_256m_mfg_defconfig
```


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot does mfg mean


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Kobo still has done the mistake
to put
256MB
of
RAM
in a 2 years old
device


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Don't use mfg


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot does mfg mean


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
mfg=manufacturing I guess


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I never use them


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
you know, nia is cheap


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Just take `mx6ull_ntx_lpddr2_256m_defconfig`


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
and why would it need more?


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I do know


[2/18/2022 5:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
its a ereader


[2/18/2022 5:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, Elipsa (2021) has 1G, Glo HD (2015) has 512M, Libra (2019) has 512M, Clara (2018) has 512M, so


[2/18/2022 5:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also there is a substantial speed increase with InkBox devices which have 512M of RAM


[2/18/2022 5:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But anyways, end of the rant


[2/18/2022 6:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
nia is just cheap


[2/18/2022 6:02‚ÄØPM] szybet
it just writted it to the config?

Try with a different compiler


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I cannot help you on those errors


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But you can build this code somehow


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Sometimes just changing compiler will solve the issue


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
like which one? i have the 4.9


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont think changing to a older one will help


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you clone the InkBox kernel repo?


[2/18/2022 6:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it did for me


[2/18/2022 6:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
changing to a newer one


[2/18/2022 6:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
im using the compiler from kobo reader repo


[2/18/2022 6:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok; clone InkBox kernel repo

can i write it using dd in kobo or do i need to get the sd card from inside?


[2/18/2022 6:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
and write it using the PC


[2/18/2022 6:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you can use the Kobo


[2/18/2022 6:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1K seek=1 skip=1`


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
actually im not sure if this is the correct command


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
here is a part of the script from the device, the update script
```
if [ `echo $UBOOT | grep -c imx` == 1 ]; then
        dd if=$UBOOT of=/dev/$DEVICE bs=1K seek=1
    else
        dd if=$UBOOT of=/dev/$DEVICE bs=1K seek=1 skip=1
```


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think imx is a procesor type


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe omit the skip then


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Look in the update zips from Kobo


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
See what it's called


[2/18/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
mine nia has mx6ull


[2/18/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
it called using cpu names


[2/18/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
so i will not use skip


[2/18/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
no, i think wrong


[2/18/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will, there is a else


[2/18/2022 6:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
backup the boot sector


[2/18/2022 6:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what's `fdisk -l` on your device?


[2/18/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
i have backup of the whole sd card


[2/18/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
like, i bricked my ereader 5 times already


[2/18/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, well flashing only the boot sector would probably be better for the sd


[2/18/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
i can copy only the boot sector from the sd card


[2/18/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok


[2/18/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, do that if you brick it


[2/18/2022 6:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
its dead

D:


[2/18/2022 6:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
even the led doesn't work


[2/18/2022 6:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then probably skip=1


[2/18/2022 6:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
XD


[2/18/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
my pc doesn't list partitions?


[2/18/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
um...


[2/18/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You probably just have overwritten the DOS boot sector!

[2/18/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
??? how


[2/18/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Just reflash the unpartitioned space, you'll get it back


[2/18/2022 7:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you include skip or seek?


[2/18/2022 7:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
i included seek


[2/18/2022 7:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
strange then


[2/18/2022 7:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
idk


[2/18/2022 7:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
partitions are back


[2/18/2022 7:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
u-boot works


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
but the kernel does not boot


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Oh...


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh i know


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Strange


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
i had a custom one


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ah


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
i randomly copied 5 Mb of the boot sector


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think i cut the kernel in half


[2/18/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
and the other half is the custom one


[2/18/2022 7:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Whoops


[2/18/2022 7:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
30 Mb will be good then :D


[2/18/2022 7:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
the second option does not work either, but now i see the partition table


[2/18/2022 7:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
so u-boot does not work


[2/18/2022 7:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm, maybe the config?


[2/18/2022 7:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
I the cmd in the oryginal u-boot, there were those commands, in the config they are off, so the config is wrong

[2/18/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
its very bad


[2/18/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes it is


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
can i launch u-boot from u-boot?


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
so i dont need to rewrite it every time


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I think you need to load it to memory first, then `go <memory address>`


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But maybe you can use download mode


[2/18/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will download it using tftp


[2/18/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Is there a `download_mode` command in your U-Boot?


[2/18/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
i checked the command


[2/18/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
there were many of them, like tftp, usb, i2c, boot from usb etc


[2/18/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You have to use `uuu` to download U-Boot

whots that?


[2/18/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
An USB downloader


[2/18/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Takes U-Boot and writes it into the Nia's RAM


[2/18/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then starts it


[2/18/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
which command does this to ram?


[2/18/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`uuu u-boot.imx`


[2/18/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
with sudo if required


[2/18/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
and i think i can fastboot boot img?


[2/18/2022 7:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes, but that is for the kernel only AFAIK


[2/18/2022 7:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
this command has not a good description


[2/18/2022 7:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If there is no `download_mode` command in U-Boot, then you could enter this:
```
eBR-1A # mw 20d8040 30
eBR-1A # mw 20d8044 10000000
eBR-1A # reset
```
But I suggest you wait a bit; @andi might have some warnings since it's a different platform


[2/18/2022 7:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Basically does "Take `u-boot.imx` file and load it in IMX USB device plugged in, then start it"


[2/18/2022 7:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
?... whots that


[2/18/2022 7:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Basically `download_mode` without the actual command

[2/18/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
if it fails, it will reset?


[2/18/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean the u-boot


[2/18/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
or i can just reboot it


[2/18/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
nevermind


[2/18/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So that the SoC thinks there's a download mode pin activated until a complete hardware reset is done (power down, power up, not just `reset` in U-Boot)


[2/18/2022 7:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, you have to do the power-down-up sequence described before


[2/18/2022 7:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But I suggest we wait for andi1 to give some advice
Maybe it could physically damage your device, I don't know


[2/18/2022 7:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Otherwise, if you have the `download_mode` command, you can try that


[2/18/2022 7:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will not use those command, they feel dangerous


[2/18/2022 7:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, we have to know if we're writing the right thing at the right place, after that we don't have to worry


[2/18/2022 7:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe you can try the tftp thing you were talking about

I guess the only option now would be to try the `mw` commands above
Or just flash U-Boot to the MMC with `skip=1`


[2/18/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
1 i need to be sure thats this is safe*
2 i could, but i dont think getting it to work will be easy and fast, and unplugging the sd card from the inside many many times is not a good idea. the sd port could be damaged, the battery plug after many plug-unplug cykles too, and just tinkering with the inside is risky, there are ribbons, voltage to short


[2/18/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, once you get a working U-Boot, you can boot the kernel or flash it with fastboot


[2/18/2022 8:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The goal is just to get it booting and have it loading the kernel at sector 81920 with 18432 load size


[2/18/2022 8:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ooooh


[2/18/2022 8:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

`ums 0 mmc 0`

i dont need the partition, i want to get the bootloader to work


[2/18/2022 9:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The load address is hardcoded in the SoC

and i could't boot from uboot then?


[2/18/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you try to flash it with `dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1K seek=1 skip=1`?


[2/18/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
When it is powered on, the SoC searches for something at sector 0x400 of the MMC, which is 1K. If it doesn't find anything there, it won't boot.

We know this is the newer UBoot simply because the normal one we're using outputs an October date rather than a November one.

Unfotunately, it hangs at that point, with the watchdog timer eventually kicking in and rebooting back to the original UBoot but I suspect that has to do with UBoot not liking the current state of the device (i.e., it doesn't like initialising it twice).

So we'll have to figure out how to convince it to do so but at least we've gotten it booting another copy of itself, which is what the question was about.

the kernel is too big, right?

then compile more modules, the are stored in the initframs

[2/18/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] szybet

[2/18/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The thing is that the modules are embedded in the initramfs

in a squashfs


[2/18/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] szybet

the kernel will be smaller


[2/18/2022 9:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[2/18/2022 9:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
because the initramfs is embedded in the kernel

if it wasn't like that it could work without modyfication

i dont know if it must be like that


[2/18/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe another option would be to load the kernel from a partition
But I think the vendor U-Boot prevents that and loads it from the unpartitioned space anyway


[2/18/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You can try


[2/18/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`extload` command


[2/18/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But at this point, there's got to be a way to compile U-Boot
I mean, it's not possible that it can't work


[2/18/2022 9:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you try flashing Kobo's provided U-Boot to your MMC? Does that work?


[2/18/2022 9:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think yes, but i will try it one more time to be sure


[2/18/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Be sure to flash this file
`upgrade/mx6ull-ntx/u-boot-mx6ull-E60U20-LPDDR2-256MB.imx`


[2/18/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`dd if=u-boot-mx6ull-E60U20-LPDDR2-256MB.imx of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1K seek=1 skip=1`


[2/18/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes i use this


[2/18/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And it doesn't work?


[2/18/2022 9:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think it worked, i will try it now

[2/18/2022 9:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
it does not work?


[2/18/2022 9:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats... weird?


[2/18/2022 9:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes it is


[2/18/2022 9:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So maybe what you compiled was good


[2/18/2022 9:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
no, i restored it to work by dd 30M of the sd image


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
so the old is working


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes, but if the provided official one does not work, there is a problem


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
but if i try to flash it kills himself

what--


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
here is literally the update script


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
it just bricks


[2/18/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh the device


[2/18/2022 9:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
when you reboot it you mean?


[2/18/2022 9:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[2/18/2022 10:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's really strange

[2/18/2022 10:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
but in the working one there is some data before the u-boot


[2/18/2022 10:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
and the not working one does not


[2/18/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
click watch oryginal for better wiev


[2/18/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I don't really know what to say


[2/18/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
There seem to be differences between the two


[2/18/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But I can't interpret them


[2/18/2022 10:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
there are maybe diffrent u-boot versions, but the concerning thing is the data that isin't in the bricked


[2/18/2022 10:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
its maybe a header for the cpu, to check for something


[2/18/2022 10:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
like, android devices kernels need special headers to boot


[2/18/2022 10:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm... @andi  so whot about the download mode?


[2/18/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean this


[2/18/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
im dumb


[2/18/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
i figured it out


[2/18/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
i can now write using dd


[2/18/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
the command is dd if=$UBOOT of=/dev/$DEVICE bs=1K seek=1 without skip


[2/18/2022 11:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
**the custom kernel is working, i needed to use the .imx file**

[2/19/2022 4:49‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Nice!


[2/19/2022 11:04‚ÄØAM] szybet
1 the command was wrong, **without skip, not with it**
2 idk, why when i tested without skip it erased the dos, maybe the sd card reader was faulty this one time
3 i needed to use the compiled .imx file, not been like you said

[2/19/2022 1:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
ok, now im waiting for instructions whot to change in the kernel and bootloader


[2/19/2022 1:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
and how to install inkbox


[2/19/2022 3:50‚ÄØPM] andi15701
generally abut uboot and skip: if the uboot.imx binary starts with  zeros, you need the skip


[2/19/2022 3:50‚ÄØPM] andi15701
if not, you do not need it


[2/19/2022 3:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
? its working now


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
it is working


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats the point now


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe the bin file would work too


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] andi15701
no


[2/19/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
good to notice


[2/19/2022 3:52‚ÄØPM] andi15701
that download mode needs the uboot.imx without all that leading zeros


[2/19/2022 3:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont have the command for download mode


[2/19/2022 3:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
and i didn't saw a option for it in the config by menuconfig?


[2/19/2022 3:55‚ÄØPM] andi15701
that stone-age 2009.08 kobo-patched uboot prepends the zeros in the build process, and fastboot flash bootloader strips them. Later uboots do not prepend that zeros.

[2/19/2022 3:55‚ÄØPM] andi15701

[2/19/2022 3:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[2/19/2022 3:56‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but you can do the two magic mw commands


[2/19/2022 3:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
are they safe?***


[2/19/2022 3:56‚ÄØPM] andi15701
i will check for the 6ull


[2/19/2022 3:56‚ÄØPM] szybet

for the 6sl and 6sll they are safe


[2/19/2022 3:57‚ÄØPM] andi15701
just writing to some volatile registers


[2/19/2022 3:57‚ÄØPM] andi15701
which get reset on some power cycle


[2/19/2022 3:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
@tux-linux you could describe the steps to install inkbox, I can now compile the kernel and u-boot


[2/19/2022 3:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's really more like doing it as we go, there isn't a premade manual or anything
You can look at the Libra H2O porting thread to get an idea


[2/19/2022 3:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm, okay


[2/19/2022 4:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll guide you
I'll be ready in some 10mins


[2/19/2022 4:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
sure i will wait


[2/19/2022 4:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So you got a kernel compiled, and it works, right?


[2/19/2022 4:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
i have compiled many kernels, the work


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
so yes


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
in the kobo you mean?


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
because sometimes they are finicky about compiler used


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
for the kobo, yes


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
i tryied to make usb host to work, so i compiled many of them


[2/19/2022 4:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok nice


[2/19/2022 4:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So what I'll first do will be to integrate the vendor sources into InkBox kernel tree


[2/19/2022 4:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm okay


[2/19/2022 4:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you modify anything to get it working, or it compiled and started fine out of the box?

[2/19/2022 4:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Does it work if you try to compile with `armv7l-linux-musleabihf`?

[2/19/2022 4:13‚ÄØPM] szybet

[2/19/2022 4:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, sometimes they compile fine but they don't boot


[2/19/2022 4:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

yes


[2/19/2022 4:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Can you try with `arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf`?


[2/19/2022 4:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
one sec


[2/19/2022 4:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I know it is GCC 4.9, but it seems to compile fine my Libra's kernel which is also 4.1.15


[2/19/2022 4:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, does your Nia have any other physical buttons somewhere or do you only have the power button?


[2/19/2022 4:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
ony the power button


[2/19/2022 4:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok


[2/19/2022 4:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The Wi-Fi device uses 8189fs module I guess


[2/19/2022 4:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

technically


[2/19/2022 5:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot is this program doing


[2/19/2022 5:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Is it like an LD_PRELOAD trick that hijacks the QPA and Nickel?


[2/19/2022 5:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
This should give you a small kernel that can still boot Nickel in `kernel/out/n306/zImage-root`
Try it and report back if it boots


[2/19/2022 5:11‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to change n306 and root at the end to smth else?


[2/19/2022 5:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[2/19/2022 5:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
just `dd if=zImage-root of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=2048`


[2/19/2022 5:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll also grab U-Boot sources and put them into the tree as well


[2/19/2022 5:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
n306 is nia codename?

@tux-linux how many changes were needed for the kernel aside from the oryginal? are there enabled chipidea controllers, and usb host support? is it the same kernel version?


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
For InkBox?
Nothing, usually


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I only modify the kernel config


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
not the code


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean the kernel config


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
unless there's something really messed up


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot was there edited


[2/19/2022 5:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh; well namely, you have to enable loopback device support, FUSE, squashFS and other things


[2/19/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i'll do that for you


[2/19/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But once I set up the config, Nickel won't boot anymore since InkBox is a completely different infrastructure

[2/19/2022 5:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well maybe you can do something with it


[2/19/2022 5:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`mx6ull_ntx_lpddr2_256m_defconfig` so that U-Boot config worked?


[2/19/2022 5:30‚ÄØPM] pgaskin
yes


[2/19/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh nice


[2/19/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[2/19/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
well.... it will be easier to install libusb on your open source system that on kobo's default one


[2/19/2022 5:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe not


[2/19/2022 5:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Have you looked on how InkBox OS root filesystem is mounted at boot?


[2/19/2022 5:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's a read-only squashFS archive


[2/19/2022 5:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It can be made read-write with overlayfs-fuse though


[2/19/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So actually yes, according to your recent enough kernel version you should be able to install things without issue


[2/19/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
yea, and most imporant, kobo is making some weird udev parkour with usb, i tryied to disable it but with no success i think


[2/19/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You have to use the `--no-cache` option of `apk` to install packages though, otherwise it won't work


[2/19/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
on your system i can see everything

[2/19/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
does it have a package manager???


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, it's based on Alpine Linux


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh god thanks


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
and oh god no


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But it's an outdated version


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Alpine 3.10 from 2019


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
i installed alpine on my tablet and use it as a small server


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
and installing software on it was pain


[2/19/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
why no cache?


[2/19/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If I used more recent versions of Alpine on devices with 2.6.35.3 kernels (>70% of supported devices), all (literally) binaries segfaulted and I couldn't get the system to work


[2/19/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no idea


[2/19/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It doesn't work if I omit it


[2/19/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
weird


[2/19/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
do you know why?


[2/19/2022 5:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, running a 2021 system on a 12 year old kernel isn't a good idea from the start


[2/19/2022 5:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
true


[2/19/2022 5:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Interestingly enough, when you compiled latest musl and busybox yourself, it ran without issue


[2/19/2022 5:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So I tried to recompile all the Alpine packages on a Raspberry Pi but it ended up being waaaay too much work


[2/19/2022 5:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
also, why squashfs filesyste?


[2/19/2022 5:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
true, its too much effort. 2019 is good


[2/19/2022 5:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
1. Saves space
2. Read-only, if you set it to read-write you just delete the overlayfs cache to have a clean rootfs again
3. No MMC writes unless you have read-write enabled (well, read-only mount on standard partition works too, but squashfs is even better)


[2/19/2022 5:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
right


[2/19/2022 5:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, it is oh-so-helpful for updates


[2/19/2022 5:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
the only downside is that is not so easy to install software on it


[2/19/2022 5:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You just put a rootfs.squashfs file in the update package and scripts handle this for you


[2/19/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, overlayfs on newer devices like the Nia, Clara HD, Libra, makes this painless


[2/19/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`ifsctl mnt rootfs rw` and you're good to go


[2/19/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] szybet

i can program in rust, and its written in rust


[2/19/2022 5:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
and its super fast


[2/19/2022 5:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But InkBox **already** has a built-in ebook reader!


[2/19/2022 5:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I did not make InkBox so that people could install KOReader and Plato on it


[2/19/2022 5:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
if it will be realy good i will need to learn cpp!


[2/19/2022 5:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats true

to install inkbox on nia


[2/19/2022 5:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
i programmed some arduinos, stm32 with cpp and it was sometimes pain, rust is easier

i need to do it?


[2/19/2022 5:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
compile u-boot with nickel?


[2/19/2022 5:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, to change kernel sector to 81920 and load size to 18432


[2/19/2022 5:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`git pull` and compile U-Boot in `bootloader/mx6ull-n306/`

[2/19/2022 5:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 5:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And it should fail to boot


[2/19/2022 5:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But you should at least see a boot log

[2/19/2022 6:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
but on the other side its a ereader


[2/19/2022 6:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Look at Kindles


[2/19/2022 6:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Newer ones have an even more strict security policy and implement HAB (verified boot in-SoC) to ensure kernel is signed correctly


[2/19/2022 6:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
its only becouse to ensure that DRM will work corectly


[2/19/2022 6:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
it does not have much to do with security


[2/19/2022 6:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
and why do you need those private keys? could't i do it myself?


[2/19/2022 6:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes, too, but it is easier for some tasks (GUI bundle)
Also if somehow you decide not to contribute at some point, I won't be able to sign the packages without you


[2/19/2022 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
Gui bundle?


[2/19/2022 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
I dont understand the second point


[2/19/2022 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
like sure, private keys are needed


[2/19/2022 6:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
Will i build the filesystem with those keys, and then upload them to inkbox repo?


[2/19/2022 6:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Only public key


[2/19/2022 6:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You'll be the only person with me that will know the private key


[2/19/2022 6:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
update.isa file in update packages
Contains qt, python and inkbox


[2/19/2022 6:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It isn't versioned yet, so it's local work currently


[2/19/2022 6:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[2/19/2022 6:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Now you can sign the rootfs


[2/19/2022 6:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux (pinned)
`openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out rootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.squashfs`


[2/19/2022 6:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
public keys are embedded in the initrd


[2/19/2022 6:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
let me put the one you shared in there


[2/19/2022 6:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
done


[2/19/2022 6:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
now, copy those files into partition 3 of sd card


[2/19/2022 6:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
when we speak about security, whot about encrypting files ( books ). they could be easly accesed when unplugging the sd card


[2/19/2022 6:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
and the lock screen would not help


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
some books are expensive, it would be nice if the thiev of the ereader could't get them


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
already done


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
really?


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hehe


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Look at the features list


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh here i see


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
- Encrypted storage with EncFS


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
That was a wild ride


[2/19/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
you mean ootfs.squashfs.dgst rootfs.squashfs private.pem?


[2/19/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Probably the most complicated script I ever made https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/encfs

[2/19/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
not private.pem
only rootfs.squashfs*


[2/19/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
so 2 files?


[2/19/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
this looks terrifyingly


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I know right


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it works so i'm happy


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
does it impact performance?


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, creating the encrypted storage archive can take a lot of time


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
5 mins on extreme cases


[2/19/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But once it's done it is fast to mount


[2/19/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
i did ums 0 mmc 0 and i try to mount the partition and i cant


[2/19/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to format it?


[2/19/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
This is the function in InkBox GUI
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/master/encryptionmanager.cpp


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
also, why only one partition is showing in dolphin


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
ext4?


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`mkfs.ext4 -O "^metadata_csum" /dev/mmcblk0p3`


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
do the same for p1, p2 and p4


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
because the other ones aren't formatted


[2/19/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
this one isin't too


[2/19/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And partition 1 is the only one that still starts at the same sector


[2/19/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
is it with the size 128 Mb?


[2/19/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot is in the 500 Mb partition stored?


[2/19/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
After that:
Clone the emu repo
Grab `overlaymount-rootfs.squashfs` from `sd/` directory, sign it the same way you did with `rootfs.squashfs` and put the two files in p3 as well


[2/19/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
recoveryfs


[2/19/2022 6:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[2/19/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
https://youtu.be/KaBj7acHRHk?t=2010
See here, it's a serial log from the Touch C, the recovery partition is featured in the middle of the section

InkBox OS 1.5
InkBox OS is a complete operating system replacement for Kobo eReader devices. It currently runs on the Glo, Touch and Mini models. It is built around Qt 5.15.2 and namely features ePUB rendering. Along that, full KoBox/X11 support is integrated, allowing the user to run X apps natively on the device.
InkBox OS is built around a core concept: se...

[2/19/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
where is the sd directory? in which repo?


[2/19/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
emu repo


[2/19/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/emu


[2/19/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay, it takes some time to launch it


[2/19/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait, does it run on the kobo using the emulator?


[2/19/2022 6:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[2/19/2022 6:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's just that the file I want you to put there is available in this repo


[2/19/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
confusing


[2/19/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot is this file?


[2/19/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's a helper which provides squashfuse, unionfs-fuse and overlayfs-fuse binaries


[2/19/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Was too big to put in the initrd


[2/19/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
"helper"?


[2/19/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Basically a mini Alpine chroot


[2/19/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh okay


[2/19/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you can mount it if you want, to see


[2/19/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`mount overlaymount-rootfs.squashfs /mnt`

[2/19/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
so its done


[2/19/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
alright


[2/19/2022 7:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll set up the kernel config and we can have a try with what you have inside currently


[2/19/2022 7:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Meanwhile
```
cat sd/user.sqsh.* > sd/user.sqsh
sudo unsquashfs -f -d [location-of-p4]/ sd/user.sqsh
```


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's nice, the Nia has the same PPI as the Glo and Aura SE, so supporting it will be easier since all the configs are there for devices of 1024x768 resolution


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] szybet
cat?


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Assemble multiple files
user.sqsh was too big for GitHub


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] szybet
weird way to do that


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I know


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I didn't find another one


[2/19/2022 7:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But it works no problem


[2/19/2022 7:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot is p4?


[2/19/2022 7:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
userdata


[2/19/2022 7:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, X11/KoBox images as well as GUI bundle

and other things


[2/19/2022 7:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
from where i get it


[2/19/2022 7:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont really understand


[2/19/2022 7:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
In the emu repo?


[2/19/2022 7:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Same place where you found `overlaymount-rootfs.squashfs`


[2/19/2022 7:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
sudo unsquashfs -f -d sd/user.sqsh sd/user.sqsh


[2/19/2022 7:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
this doesn't see, right


[2/19/2022 7:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what


[2/19/2022 7:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`sudo unsquashfs -f -d /run/media/szybet/wherever/is/your/p4/mounted sd/user.sqsh`


[2/19/2022 7:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
partition 4?


[2/19/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 7:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
now i understand


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
its done


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
but sync takes time now


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
normal


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it's like 3G of data


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
the sd card is 7Mb/s max


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats big


[2/19/2022 7:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 7:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'm setting up the kernel config now


[2/19/2022 7:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
would you like to have the default one and modify it?


[2/19/2022 7:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i already have it


[2/19/2022 7:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
from where?


[2/19/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
in the kernel source


[2/19/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
there was it?...

`arch/arm/configs/imx_v7_kobo_defconfig`


[2/19/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh...

Well, not in InkBox default config
But you can change it
It's quite easy


[2/19/2022 7:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay, i will do it later


[2/19/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it seems already enabled btw


[2/19/2022 7:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe you can look into `USB_AUDIO`


[2/19/2022 7:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
sounds good


[2/19/2022 7:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
first i need it to register any usb device as host


[2/19/2022 7:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
you can look at dmesg-usb at whot I have achieved  already and whots the problem


[2/19/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok, it's ready


[2/19/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
pull the repo


[2/19/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And redo this


[2/19/2022 7:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Make sure this time that your kernel repo is in `/home/build/inkbox/kernel`

must this be the exact same path?

fakeroot is a good idea to implement in the future


[2/19/2022 7:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
well yes it must

maybe i have done something wrong


[2/19/2022 8:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[2/19/2022 8:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
probably related to load size

ok so it's load size


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
its bad that it could't be more


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
new devices, more hardware features ad the kernel will be bigger


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Delete `kernel/initrd/n306/opt/firmware.sqsh`


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And recompile the kernel


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It can be more


[2/19/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
so why it is not working?


[2/19/2022 8:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Max kernel size we could have would be 11.5M


[2/19/2022 8:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Because load size was set to 18432 = 9.4M


[2/19/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot is load size


[2/19/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I want to try to strip down the kernel before increasing load size


[2/19/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Number of sectors/bytes U-Boot reads from MMC to load kernel

okay


[2/19/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh


[2/19/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
and it cant be more than actual file size?


[2/19/2022 8:11‚ÄØPM] szybet
done, flash it?


[2/19/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what's its size?

after a while its rebooting


[2/19/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
but it stops for some secons at starting kernel


[2/19/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm


[2/19/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats bad... changing the kernel will be pain


[2/19/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
on the stock firmware it wasn't like that?


[2/19/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, it can be more than the actual file size


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's what I meant


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I forgot something


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
so just update u-boot?


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
whot?


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`GITDIR="${PWD}" scripts/make_devicenodes.sh`


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
in kernel repo


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then recompile kernel


[2/19/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe will it work


[2/19/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
mknod


[2/19/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
i first see something like this


[2/19/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's for making device nodes in `/dev`


[2/19/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Such as the console `ttymxc0`


[2/19/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Without that node, the kernel might hang


[2/19/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Which I think is what happened here


[2/19/2022 8:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
data abort

[2/19/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
@andi , if you have a clue, I'm all ears


[2/19/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe i will write the stock kernel to that location to see if it boots?


[2/19/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you'd need to recompile u-boot


[2/19/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
why


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
to change load sector


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah you could try the stock kernel


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
at sector 81920


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
that whot i said


[2/19/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will try it

that's good


[2/19/2022 8:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it makes sense


[2/19/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
so the kernel is wrong


[2/19/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i don't know why it doesn't work with inkbox


[2/19/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe your kernel config was wrong?


[2/19/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] szybet

[2/19/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I highly doubt it, never seen a wrong config that triggers a data abort in U-Boot


[2/19/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe the kernel has some wrong headers at beginning?


[2/19/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no idea


[2/19/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i'll concentrate on the aura 2 for some moments, I'll try andi1's kernel


[2/19/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[2/19/2022 11:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
nice!


[2/19/2022 11:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Now, you have to sign `gui_rootfs.isa` in p4


[2/19/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Important thing (as root):
```
unsquashfs -f -d g gui_rootfs.isa
cd g
echo "n306" > opt/device
rm ../gui_rootfs.isa
mksquashfs . ../gui_rootfs.isa -b 1048576 -comp xz -Xdict-size 100% -always-use-fragments
cd ..
rm -rf g
```
Then you can sign it
```
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out gui_rootfs.isa.dgst gui_rootfs.isa
```


[2/19/2022 11:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Awesome!


[2/19/2022 11:48‚ÄØPM] szybet

[2/19/2022 11:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

it isin't in emu

p4


[2/19/2022 11:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
OH


[2/19/2022 11:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it was in user.sqsh


[2/19/2022 11:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it isn't (typo correction ;p)


[2/19/2022 11:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
where did i unpack it...


[2/19/2022 11:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you unpacked it to p4


[2/19/2022 11:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh right


[2/19/2022 11:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It is `[p4]/gui_rootfs.isa`

god

[2/19/2022 11:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
np


[2/19/2022 11:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
can i do those steps not on the sd card?


[2/19/2022 11:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 11:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but you only unpack 40M worth of data


[2/19/2022 11:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh then


[2/19/2022 11:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
done, reboot?


[2/19/2022 11:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
and whot is opt/device


[2/19/2022 11:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
a identifier?


[2/19/2022 11:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[2/19/2022 11:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
to both


[2/19/2022 11:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

i will be here for 20 more minutes, than i will go to sleep, tomorrow i should have some time but not so much that today


[2/20/2022 12:01‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
I am currently editing the scripts in rootfs to include the Nia


[2/20/2022 12:01‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
There is hope!


[2/20/2022 12:01‚ÄØAM] szybet
there is


[2/20/2022 12:03‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
i'll make you the missing ui bundle


[2/20/2022 12:03‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
then you could probably see inkbox gui working


[2/20/2022 12:03‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
uploading right now


[2/20/2022 12:04‚ÄØAM] szybet
? i thinked that the problem are modules


[2/20/2022 12:04‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
no


[2/20/2022 12:04‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
that's not essential


[2/20/2022 12:04‚ÄØAM] szybet
so whot failed?


[2/20/2022 12:05‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
ui bundle signature verification


[2/20/2022 12:05‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
also the fact that the ui bundle is not there currently


[2/20/2022 12:06‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
`wget 23.163.0.39/bundles/private/update-n306.isa`


[2/20/2022 12:06‚ÄØAM] szybet
um okay, why i can't sign it by myself?


[2/20/2022 12:06‚ÄØAM] szybet
using the key i generated


[2/20/2022 12:07‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
I signed them using the keys you sent me


[2/20/2022 12:07‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
So it will work


[2/20/2022 12:07‚ÄØAM] szybet
oh okay


[2/20/2022 12:07‚ÄØAM] szybet
whot did you need to update?


[2/20/2022 12:07‚ÄØAM] szybet
and whot should i do


[2/20/2022 12:10‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
oh


[2/20/2022 12:10‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Actually it's called update.isa but it isn't really an update


[2/20/2022 12:11‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
`cp update.isa [p4]/update/update.isa`


[2/20/2022 12:11‚ÄØAM] szybet
its a sign


[2/20/2022 12:11‚ÄØAM] szybet
i know


[2/20/2022 12:11‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
contains inkbox binary, qt libs and python


[2/20/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
don't forget to sync, then reboot and hopefully you should get an ui at some point


[2/20/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] szybet
yea, i put it in the wrong directory


[2/20/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] szybet
its hard to think


[2/20/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] szybet
i always sync


[2/20/2022 12:16‚ÄØAM] szybet
so the update is actually a update, it updates the files


[2/20/2022 12:17‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
well, not really
but it doesn't really matter

`echo 3 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/rotate`
`killall inkbox-bin`

i think the touch is not correct


[2/20/2022 12:19‚ÄØAM] tux_linux

[2/20/2022 12:20‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
because of that
try it and the last command above will restart inkbox


[2/20/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] szybet
it does not launch


[2/20/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
wait a bit?


[2/20/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
what's the error?


[2/20/2022 12:22‚ÄØAM] szybet
now it worked?


[2/20/2022 12:22‚ÄØAM] szybet
i think wrong formatted from discord


[2/20/2022 12:22‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
so the touch is working?

its working

yay!!


[2/20/2022 12:23‚ÄØAM] szybet
but i think it flickers too much


[2/20/2022 12:23‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
is your power led still blinking?


[2/20/2022 12:24‚ÄØAM] szybet

i entered library, snd there is sync in progress. for how long will it be like that


[2/20/2022 12:26‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
You aren't connected to Wi-Fi so it should fail shortly


[2/20/2022 12:26‚ÄØAM] szybet
it does not


[2/20/2022 12:26‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Otherwise `killall inkbox-bin` and relaunch that env command above

[2/20/2022 12:42‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
maybe


[2/20/2022 12:42‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
kill inkbox-bin and relaunch it

relaunched it, works


[2/20/2022 12:47‚ÄØAM] szybet

in short, i think that the cpu handles usb support without any aditional chip, so could you check in the datasheet if it has support for host mode? not only gadget

[2/20/2022 12:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
In a random datasheet on the internet i see only usb otg and something about /dev/host

usb storage is not working


[2/20/2022 12:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
but i didn't updated


[2/20/2022 1:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
and i dont know how to add books?


[2/20/2022 1:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
i pasted them in gutenberg directory


[2/20/2022 1:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
and nothing


[2/20/2022 2:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`mount [p4]/onboard /mnt`


[2/20/2022 2:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Put your books in there


[2/20/2022 2:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's normal that USB storage isn't working yet
We didn't compile modules


[2/20/2022 3:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
you could just write the instructions for that, i will make it in the future


[2/20/2022 3:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Basically `make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf- modules`


[2/20/2022 3:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then `make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp/modules`
And make squashfs of this directory


[2/20/2022 3:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But I'll make you the archive
It's located in the initrd, in `opt/modules.sqsh`


[2/20/2022 3:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
I checked quickly the pdf preview, its better than in plato and faster than in koreader but the sliders sometimes dont respond, and it makes it unusable

[2/20/2022 3:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
sometimes it's difficult to reach them


[2/20/2022 3:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I pushed the modules to the kernel repo


[2/20/2022 3:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Faster? Better? Wow, I thought my PDF engine was the worst


[2/20/2022 3:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
the file chooser is the worst part, its just not made for touchscreen, and especielly for eink

[2/20/2022 3:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
koreader is written in lua, so yea. and plato uses gestures not silders, and those gestures didn't worked for me


[2/20/2022 3:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux (pinned)
So now you can recompile it, mass storage won't work right away but you can try to see if usbnet works (when connecting your Kobo via USB to your computer, it should show up as an Ethernet device)
```
echo true > [p1]/flags/USBNET_ENABLE
```


[2/20/2022 3:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, before doing that, pull the rootfs repo and make a rootfs.squashfs again, sign it and copy it into p3


[2/20/2022 3:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I modified the CPP code yesterday, so I'll share a GUI bundle at 23.163.0.39 shortly


[2/20/2022 3:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will try those modyfication next week, and if not in the next month


[2/20/2022 3:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh


[2/20/2022 3:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont have time for this in the nearest time, school sucks


[2/20/2022 3:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, I can sure wait, but maybe I won't be able to support it in 1.9 directly


[2/20/2022 3:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But anyways, thanks for your time and if you happen to have some this week, please try and report back!
P.S.: Updated GUI bundle now, available at http://23.163.0.39/bundles/private/update-n306.isa


[2/20/2022 3:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I don't really have an alternative, but you can search books with the search button, in "Local storage"

If inkbox wants to be used by normal users than this must dissapear


[2/22/2022 10:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, I mean, it isn't *that* bad


[2/22/2022 11:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
it is it is


[2/23/2022 3:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
In meantime when i dont have time to do anything, could you describe how Windows are working in inkbox? Is it xorg, is it fbink or combined?


[2/23/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What's "Windows"?


[2/23/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
like the file chooser


[2/23/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats a window


[2/23/2022 5:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Main GUI is Qt+FBInk, and KoBox is X11


[2/23/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
the whot


[2/23/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, KoBox is a way to run X11 in a Kobo


[2/23/2022 5:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh okay


[2/23/2022 5:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
so if i would develop an app, a seperate binary using fbink could it be launched as a window, like the file chooser?


[2/23/2022 5:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[2/23/2022 5:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Would need to be a cli, gtk or Qt app


[2/23/2022 5:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
why only gtk or qt? so i assume just a xorg app?


[2/23/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah


[2/23/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or Qt native


[2/23/2022 5:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
As InkBox GUI does


[2/23/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
I have written some gui apps before, in https://github.com/emilk/egui so i think i could replace the file chooser with something bigger, nicer and more touch friendly

[2/23/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The GUI is integrated in Qt and would be difficult to replace


[2/23/2022 5:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
See reader.cpp


[2/23/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think that you call the file chooser, and get a path from it right?


[2/23/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes


[2/23/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
so calling a external script and getting a string path from stdout would be easy too?


[2/23/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I guess?


[2/23/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But resources consuming too


[2/23/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
not much, rust is good at performance


[2/23/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
only the disk reading and some ram would be bad

InkBox OS 1.5
InkBox OS is a complete operating system replacement for Kobo eReader devices. It currently runs on the Glo, Touch and Mini models. It is built around Qt 5.15.2 and namely features ePUB rendering. Along that, full KoBox/X11 support is integrated, allowing the user to run X apps natively on the device.
InkBox OS is built around a core concept: se...

you dont show here those maps that were glitching out on my device, are they even working on yours?


[2/23/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] andi15701
i looked up in the datasheet, the magic mw commands in the bootloader should do the same thing as on imx6sl or 6sll


[2/23/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
so whot it does?


[2/23/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
can you share this datasheet? i want usb host get to work and the datasheets on the internet are bad


[2/23/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] andi15701
usb host: probably just debugfs...


[2/23/2022 8:37‚ÄØPM] andi15701
mw magic: it overwrites the default configuration to boot from


[2/23/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] andi15701

[2/23/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] andi15701
and in that case it is some kind of manufacturing mode where you boot from usb


[2/23/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh nice


[2/23/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] andi15701
you send uboot over usb


[2/23/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] andi15701
so for devices with internal eMMC, it is the way to test a new u-boot before flashing


[2/23/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] andi15701
cat /dev/zero >/dev/mmcblk0 also lets you end up in that mode


[2/23/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
cool to know, in that way even more ereaders could run inkbox


[2/23/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] andi15701
or removing the internatl sdcard


[2/23/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
could you look at it? I would appreciate it


[2/23/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] andi15701
hmm, did you apply external power supply?


[2/23/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
i powered the external device, but not the kobo


[2/23/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] andi15701
at least on the devices I needed some y-shaped cable


[2/23/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
i ordered some usb ports to make a cable to power both of them, but i dont think thats the case?


[2/23/2022 8:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
y-shaped?

that works for me

does this power the kobo, and the device at the same time?


[2/23/2022 8:44‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes


[2/23/2022 8:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe thats it? why would it need it to be charged?


[2/23/2022 8:45‚ÄØPM] andi15701
there might be protection diodes letting stuff go to vbus, probably higher voltages at the data lines than on vbus might be a problem


[2/23/2022 8:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats a good explanation


[2/23/2022 8:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
does your cable also have the OTG ID pin wired to ground?


[2/23/2022 8:46‚ÄØPM] andi15701
no


[2/23/2022 8:47‚ÄØPM] andi15701
usual, that is the signal to provide power at vbus


[2/23/2022 8:48‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but if that does not work, I would leave it alone to not confuse other devices


[2/23/2022 8:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
and to detect to which mode to switch, host or gadget


[2/23/2022 8:49‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but there you have the debugfs for


[2/23/2022 8:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, but some devices, and ic make it automaticly


[2/23/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] andi15701

It **should** work


[2/24/2022 6:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
why


[2/24/2022 6:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, to have the new modules


[2/24/2022 6:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
They are embedded in initrd which is embedded in the kernel


[2/24/2022 6:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
They are mounted at boot at `/modules`


[2/24/2022 6:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
why the kernel that i use now cant be used


[2/24/2022 6:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Because it has the old initrd

There are some points where @tux-linux could you please help? i writed there everything at the beginning to know
mine point is to make inkbox more *hacking* friendly, not only for mine project but for everyone. Also discord is such a horrible place where knowledge gets pulled in into a black hole.

There is no point to hack into kobo's software when there is inkbox, i think that could be the main "feature" of inkbox, not only open source, secure but also easy to understand and make your ereader like you would like with some tinkerink and developer skills

[3/5/2022 10:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Basically I just changed the load size from `18432` to `20480`


[3/5/2022 10:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Really? Usually it is pretty easy on my devices...


[3/5/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you connect to Wi-Fi?


[3/5/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If you recompiled and flashed the kernel


[3/5/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
it clickes the info button


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
nope, i dind't see a option to do that


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oooh


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wait


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
the modules doesn't work


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what?


[3/5/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
define doesn't work


[3/5/2022 10:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
+ usb storage dosn't work too


[3/5/2022 10:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, modules error then


[3/5/2022 10:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what does `ls -shal /modules` output?


[3/5/2022 10:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You don't paste `modules.sqsh` in p3, it's embedded in the initrd, at `opt/modules.sqsh`
But if you recompiled the kernel then idk
Did you pull the repo before?


[3/5/2022 10:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, i pulled


[3/5/2022 10:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
one sec


[3/5/2022 10:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
now the kernel does not boot...

[3/5/2022 10:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
wtf?


[3/5/2022 10:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
With what command did you compile the kernel?


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
env GITDIR="${PWD}" TOOLCHAINDIR="${PWD}/toolchain/arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf/" THREADS=$(($(nproc)*2)) TARGET=arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf scripts/build_kernel.sh n306 root


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
hm... do i need to do it manually?


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok, seems alright


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Is it the first time you boot the kernel since


[3/5/2022 10:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
this happened?


[3/5/2022 10:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
look, its weird

1 flashed the kernel
2 booted from it, i described the problems above
3 poweroff
4 1 hour passes
5 its bricked


[3/5/2022 10:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what if you reboot?


[3/5/2022 10:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
how?


[3/5/2022 10:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, hold down the power buttton for some seconds


[3/5/2022 10:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, what's the kernel's size?


[3/5/2022 10:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
i have tryied it, but i will try it one more time

Should be alright


[3/5/2022 11:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
look at this line:
```

```


[3/5/2022 11:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
something with modules


[3/5/2022 11:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, `Modules linked in:` only displays the loaded modules. If there were some, it would say:
`Modules linked in: g_ether sdio_wifi_pwr 8189fs` for example


[3/5/2022 11:02‚ÄØPM] szybet
then idk


[3/5/2022 11:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So now it just says that no modules are loaded


[3/5/2022 11:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
me too


[3/5/2022 11:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Can you boot Nickel? Do you have another SD card you could try Kobo factory image on?


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay i will try, but it will take time, like 1h to write the image


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then wait


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Does your screen flash when it boots the kernel?


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or it panics before?


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
nope


[3/5/2022 11:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
nope


[3/5/2022 11:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Try flashing the Nickel kernel at sector 81920
And see if it flashes
It will panic (won't be able to find the rootfs) but it should flash iirc

nickel boots ok


[3/5/2022 11:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so screen flashes?


[3/5/2022 11:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
no


[3/5/2022 11:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Can you try reflashing InkBox kernel? Maybe something in the MMC was overwritten for whatever reason and it caused the error you posted before...


[3/5/2022 11:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
what is at 2048?


[3/5/2022 11:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
sector


[3/5/2022 11:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
in inkbox


[3/5/2022 11:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
81920


[3/5/2022 11:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
nothing, InkBox uses sector 81920 for kernel


[3/5/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
there is *nothing*, really *nothing*?


[3/5/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, probably remnants of old nickel kernels I guess?


[3/5/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
hm, okay


[3/5/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but nothing is loaded from there at boot


[3/5/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
after rewriting its the same


[3/5/2022 11:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Welcome to the Mysterious and Incredibly Painful to Resolve Issues World‚Ñ¢Ô∏è!
And if you remove `kernel/initrd/n306/opt/modules.sqsh`, then recompile it, what happens?

[3/5/2022 11:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
could it be possible to skip the modules, like integrate them into the kernel ( i mean in menuconfig * not m )


[3/5/2022 11:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, because some can't always be loaded


[3/5/2022 11:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
e.g., wi-fi modules


[3/5/2022 11:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
otherwise battery would drain very fast


[3/5/2022 11:22‚ÄØPM] szybet

[3/5/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
whatever that is


[3/5/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
@andi , do you have some insight on this? I'm lost


[3/5/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hm


[3/5/2022 11:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you, at some point, write InkBox kernel to sector 2048 of the MMC?


[3/5/2022 11:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And there it could have overwritten some of the waveform, dtb, etc.


[3/5/2022 11:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
its possible, but you said there is nothing


[3/5/2022 11:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
:D


[3/5/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, after ~6MB of sector 2048, there are DTB, ntxfw, waveform and other blobs that allow the kernel to boot (that's why the kernel needs to be moved to sector 81920, otherwise there would be problems


[3/5/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
so now we know


[3/5/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will write 32 Mb of the old nickel image, and then write the inkbox bootloader


[3/5/2022 11:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
is that all that i need?


[3/5/2022 11:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/5/2022 11:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Be sure to save the partition layout


[3/5/2022 11:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Writing the old nickel image on top of that will work, but it will overwrite the partition layout


[3/5/2022 11:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
However, if you go into fdisk after that and re-partition the MMC as it was before, you'll be able to mount partitions again and nothing will be lost (don't format them though, just re-partition the MMC)


[3/5/2022 11:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
where is the partition layout


[3/5/2022 11:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh, like that


[3/5/2022 11:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, you can do `fdisk -l`


[3/5/2022 11:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will make a copy of the whole sd card, and then do this

{Reactions}
üëç 

[3/5/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
meantime you could look at the other problems, errors


[3/5/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, if porting InkBox to the Nia leads to a hardware brick, better to solve this first


[3/5/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(I don't say it's an hardware brick, but it might be for some obscure reason that I don't know about)


[3/5/2022 11:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
this would be sad


[3/5/2022 11:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
but whot module could brick it


[3/5/2022 11:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
if you think this could be a brick, i will simply flash the entire nickel image


[3/5/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
also, can I dd the whole disk using ums from u-boot?


[3/5/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, but I don't think ums is that stable for such a big write


[3/5/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'd just take the SD out

[3/6/2022 12:55‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Maybe MMC corruption then?

Well it should


[3/6/2022 3:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll make you another GUI bundle too
I added quite a lot of things to InkBox since two weeks ago


[3/6/2022 3:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
the most important thing is the screen rotating

It will be fixed

https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/gui-bundle
FYI, you can now generate the bundle yourself, but it requires you to compile InkBox Qt code before, which is painful to setup, so probably better if I just send it to you

[3/6/2022 3:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
haven't tried yet, but wifi networks are showing up


[3/6/2022 3:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It seems to be somewhat difficult to connect to some networks in InkBox for some reason

[3/6/2022 3:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 3:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wpa_supplicant is used to actually connect to the network, and then dhcpcd is launched to obtain a DHCP lease

[3/6/2022 4:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok nice


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
so it does not work


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well there's progress


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`rmmod` all the modules you have loaded now


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
can i just reboot?


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2022 4:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
because it will load them again with usbnet


[3/6/2022 4:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I edited the commands there so that it can work


[3/6/2022 4:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
```
kobo:~# lsmod

so i:
rmod usb_f_mass_storage
rmod libcomposite
rmod configfs
right?

Nice!


[3/6/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
could you describe what you needed to do?


[3/6/2022 4:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Just load the necessary modules
When on newer kernels, there are dependencies to make the function itself more portable instead of just throwing everything into one module like on older devices


[3/6/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
it adds more complecity


[3/6/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
but okay

[3/6/2022 4:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Normally it's handled by `modprobe`


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh, okay


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But when you have it scripted up it isn't a problem anymore


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
that makes sense


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe the wifi choosing menu a little bigger? its smolllll


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I know right


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
when i choose wifi, or a file i don't need to see anything else


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
There isn't any way I found to do this


[3/6/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
good


[3/6/2022 4:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe it will be slightly bigger in the new UI bundle I made

are you sure? on which partition is it?


[3/6/2022 4:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
p4


[3/6/2022 4:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`/data/firmware` is a symlink to `[p4]/update`

[3/6/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 5:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
what is the max kernel size?


[3/6/2022 5:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
~10.5M


[3/6/2022 5:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
adding usb audio, and alsa support could take it


[3/6/2022 5:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
not good


[3/6/2022 5:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
An alternative would maybe be to put the kernel in a partition and `extload` it from U-Boot


[3/6/2022 5:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or put the modules... somewhere else


[3/6/2022 5:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
this this this this


[3/6/2022 5:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(well, alsa modules I mean)

well this too


[3/6/2022 5:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
usb storage does not work


[3/6/2022 5:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Because the tricky part is that the modules differ for each device

You can use `htop` to see what it's doing

[3/6/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
WHY


[3/6/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It will be there


[3/6/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
to get the ip i need to generate a whole system report


[3/6/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[3/6/2022 6:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Just system info


[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Not the same thing


[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
still... no


[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
show a window after connecting to wifi


[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
with the ip


[3/6/2022 6:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you can do `nmap -sP 10.42.0.0/24` on your host otherwise


[3/6/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
i can even check it with cmd on serial connection


[3/6/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
but thats not the case


[3/6/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
and this?


[3/6/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it doesn't


[3/6/2022 6:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe this could be something to add in settings


[3/6/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
so it just disconnects randomly?


[3/6/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[3/6/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it stays connected


[3/6/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] szybet

[3/6/2022 6:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`dmesg`?


[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
let me check this one more time


[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to enter the password every time?


[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
normally, no


[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
but?


[3/6/2022 6:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it auto-connects on boot


[3/6/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it's complicated, but it will only do so when we have the recoveryfs


[3/6/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i.e. in release


[3/6/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
i see here room for improvement, its a basic feature to remember wifi passwords


[3/6/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it does remember them


[3/6/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
i need to enter it one more time now


[3/6/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
so how does it remember


[3/6/2022 6:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`cat /data/config/17-wifi_connection_information/*`


[3/6/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, there are stored password and essid


[3/6/2022 6:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
but i needed to enter it one more time


[3/6/2022 6:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The main problem with auto-connecting to a network would be if you changed the password of the ssid or had the same ssid but not the same password


[3/6/2022 6:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Once the recoveryfs is in place, the initrd will do that on boot:
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/kernel/blob/master/initrd/common/setup-wifi


[3/6/2022 6:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
a button to reset the password and essid


[3/6/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But then it has to see if the ssid is the same as the one saved, open another dialog
i.e. pain ;p


[3/6/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but it could be doable


[3/6/2022 6:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Though it would not have much purpose unless you decided to disable Wi-Fi and re-enable it after


[3/6/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
since it would already be auto-connected on boot


[3/6/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
and a button to enable, disable the wifi


[3/6/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that is even more complicated


[3/6/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
its more pain to enter the password every time


[3/6/2022 6:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the Wi-Fi connection framework was one of the hardest and most confusing things I have done in Qt


[3/6/2022 6:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but you are connected now, it works, right?


[3/6/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes it works, and it does not dissconnect


[3/6/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
but still pain to enter the password every time


[3/6/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
or maybe a dialog "would you like to enter a new password or use this: "xyz""


[3/6/2022 6:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Hmm yeah maybe


[3/6/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
and a list of saved networks + password to show


[3/6/2022 6:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
I really will have to learn cpp and qt

[3/6/2022 7:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
in alpine there are like 5 diffrent


[3/6/2022 7:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
the stock one was not working


[3/6/2022 7:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
so idk which you used


[3/6/2022 7:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`date -s "2022-03-06 19:17`


[3/6/2022 7:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`hwclock --systohc`


[3/6/2022 7:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
and you're done


[3/6/2022 7:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it's not a real sync, but the simplest method I have


[3/6/2022 7:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe a NTP would be better


[3/6/2022 7:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or this


[3/6/2022 7:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux (pinned)
`sudo date -s "$(wget --method=HEAD -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f2-7)"`

[3/6/2022 7:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh thats cool


[3/6/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
don't forget to `hwclock --systohc` after that


[3/6/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
it takes long


[3/6/2022 7:21‚ÄØPM] szybet

what do you mean by search


[3/6/2022 7:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, the search button


[3/6/2022 7:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Another thing to try after that would be X11


[3/6/2022 7:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It should be ok but just to be sure


[3/6/2022 7:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
lightmaps are flickering


[3/6/2022 7:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
not usable at all


[3/6/2022 7:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well it's usually not the main reason why someone installs inkbox

[3/6/2022 7:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 7:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux (pinned)
you can `rc-service inkbox_gui restart`


[3/6/2022 7:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh; you will need to run again the command with wget that fetches inkbox binary


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
you mean search a word?


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, or a book in online library


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or in your onboard storage


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
does this search a book local?


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
to see how the keyboard behaves


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
both


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes it does


[3/6/2022 7:28‚ÄØPM] szybet

[3/6/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
blank page


[3/6/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
if you click next


[3/6/2022 7:35‚ÄØPM] szybet

[3/6/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
and?


[3/6/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
don't know what's causing it


[3/6/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
probably some tmpfs mount/umount quirk


[3/6/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
only with epubs?


[3/6/2022 7:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no, when opening a pdf then an epub

wow


[3/6/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
huh


[3/6/2022 7:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
when you open an epub, do you see `mutool` in the process list with `top` or `ps`?


[3/6/2022 7:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait


[3/6/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
it boots really slow btw


[3/6/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what do you mean?


[3/6/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
1 minute?


[3/6/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's not slow


[3/6/2022 8:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

if it doesn't work we have a serious problem

[3/6/2022 8:09‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, will boot it now


[3/6/2022 8:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, mine works alright


[3/6/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What's the "Git" part of the system info in Settings?


[3/6/2022 8:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 8:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
wtf
1 reboot
2 opened a pdf 3 times
3 opened another pdf, blank page


[3/6/2022 8:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Do you have the "Global reading settings" option disabled?


[3/6/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
Pinned a message.


[3/6/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
There's also a tiny shell script around this command, so you can just as well do `restart inkbox_gui`


[3/6/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(or any other service)


[3/6/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
no?


[3/6/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
disabled now


[3/6/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
try again; I'm curious


[3/6/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
this option, when disabled, permits you to save the last page you read in the book and go back to it automatically


[3/6/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
some pdfs work, some not


[3/6/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
only one pdf is working


[3/6/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
only one book is working


[3/6/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats the one i used in the past to test things


[3/6/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
try one from gutenberg


[3/6/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
they have a very high success rate


[3/6/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or you can get one from online library


[3/6/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
btw, you can also display images along pdf and epubs


[3/6/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
pngs, jpgs, etc.


[3/6/2022 8:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
i don't have any


[3/6/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
heh, discovered that if you open an image, then an epub, then the image again, it segfaults


[3/6/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
awesome


[3/6/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Some bugs may have appeared like that but since my userbase is currently very tiny I don't know much about them


[3/6/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I should really implement something like sickel


[3/6/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
from gutenberg it works


[3/6/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Which restarts Nickel when it segfaults/closes unexpectedly


[3/6/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok nice


[3/6/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I tried with other books, even one with 1500+ pages and it worked


[3/6/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(not from gutenberg)


[3/6/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe it's specific to your epub


[3/6/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
all of my books?


[3/6/2022 8:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
only one is working, that is some images pasted into pdf using libreoffice

thats why the one pdf works


[3/6/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you can put books in subdirectories, but the config settings will be on the root of the onboard storage


[3/6/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or... it should work?


[3/6/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
normally they do


[3/6/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
its the only one that works, the pdf is in the main directory


[3/6/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait, i will copy the diode


[3/6/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, try that


[3/6/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
it works


[3/6/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's not good news for me


[3/6/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

what with epubs?


[3/6/2022 9:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
try if you want


[3/6/2022 9:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

you dont need to download it, you can watch it in the browser

no it downloaded it directly


[3/6/2022 9:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/6/2022 9:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk, generally


[3/6/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, your books work now with that option enabled, right?

[3/6/2022 9:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
little tip: you can click on the area where you want the slider to go to get there easily

it takes more time

[3/6/2022 9:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
everything works


[3/6/2022 9:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
and then nothing


[3/6/2022 9:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
did you experience UI freeze sometimes? I think so, right?


[3/6/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
sometimes


[3/6/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
the file chooser, maybe changing pages


[3/6/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
though the video shows you stressed the UI to its maximum so it should have crashed already


[3/6/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
??? stressed ui?


[3/6/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
by freeze, I mean completely freezing, you're not able to do anything, you have to `restart inkbox_gui`?


[3/6/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, rapidly clicking next page button for example


[3/6/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Most devices handle that well but on my Libra for example this can lead to an UI freeze


[3/6/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Since the Libra has the same kernel version that of the Nia, I wanted to check


[3/6/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
through the video, only at the end


[3/6/2022 9:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
i cant click fast? common...


[3/6/2022 9:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, you can, normally


[3/6/2022 9:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I think that UI freeze is due to the fact that it expects to have a PDF displayed but it's actually an epub and it panics, so unrelated


[3/6/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe


[3/6/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I was talking about UI freezes by the platform plugin


[3/6/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it works on touch, mini, glo, glo hd, aura 2, but is unstable on the Libra


[3/6/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so I wanted to see if yours was unstable or not


[3/6/2022 9:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it seems stable


[3/6/2022 9:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
yea, it seems

3 launch a epub that worked before, it works
4 launch the pdf that worked all the time, it freezes exactly like the last book on the video, no information on serial


[3/6/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, well first do `rc-service inkbox_gui restart` to see inkbox stdout

When an user first opened an ePUB, then a PDF, it didn't work. This was
due to an issue with the two tmpfs at '/kobo/inkbox' and '/kobo/run'.
This commit fixes that issue.

[3/7/2022 4:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
no, epubs dont work


[3/7/2022 4:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
linus book works perfectly here


[3/7/2022 4:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
did you reboot?


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, i can reboot one more time


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
for me none epubs work


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
do reboot


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
this is weird


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh, one works


[3/7/2022 4:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
is it the one not in a subdir for some reason?


[3/7/2022 4:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
all of them are in a subdir


[3/7/2022 4:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
do you open them with the recent books buttons or the file manager?


[3/7/2022 4:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
both


[3/7/2022 4:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
even with search


[3/7/2022 4:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
does search work with subdirs?


[3/7/2022 4:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/7/2022 4:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
nice


[3/7/2022 4:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I can't see what's causing the issue


[3/7/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`while true; do ls -shal /kobo/run /kobo/inkbox; sleep 1; done`


[3/7/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
?


[3/7/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
please run this on the kobo


[3/7/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
open an ePUB, then a PDF, then an ePUB


[3/7/2022 4:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
with what, search, file, recent?


[3/7/2022 4:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
file manager


[3/7/2022 4:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
does that make a diffrence when i use something else?


[3/7/2022 4:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
something else what?


[3/7/2022 4:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, it should not


[3/7/2022 4:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(if you're talking about opening methods)


[3/7/2022 4:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
also, the file manager is slow, its hard to use so i avoid it as much i can


[3/7/2022 4:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/7/2022 4:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then Search is probably your best friend


[3/7/2022 4:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe I should just put a search-like file manager instead


[3/7/2022 4:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
no, a list is needed to


[3/7/2022 4:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
?


[3/7/2022 4:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont remember names of all my books


[3/7/2022 4:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No I mean, display a file list like if you searched for pdf, epub, png at once


[3/7/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So it displays a list of all compatible books found


[3/7/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/7/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats better


[3/7/2022 4:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
also, try to reboot


[3/7/2022 4:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
everything works now, i will reboot and use the last books menu


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what?


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
nonsense


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what did you do


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes it is


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
the only thing i did in a other way, that i used the file manager not the search menu


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wait; i'll try with the file manager on my side


[3/7/2022 4:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
*search I mean


[3/7/2022 4:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh; maybe the search function doesn't understand relative paths


[3/7/2022 4:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it doesn't work here too


[3/7/2022 4:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
try putting linus book in onboard root and open it with search again


[3/7/2022 4:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
search doesn't work for me


[3/7/2022 4:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe add a check function that checks if a file exists


[3/7/2022 4:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
or smth...


[3/7/2022 4:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
even if the file is in onboard root?


[3/7/2022 4:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait


[3/7/2022 4:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
onboard works


[3/7/2022 4:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, i see the problem


[3/7/2022 4:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/8501b42124a8c44c79dfa455d3dfac577395bb99/generaldialog.cpp#L336-L357


[3/7/2022 4:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I only save `dirIt.fileName()` while I should also save `dirIt.filePath()` to allow opening files in subdirs


[3/7/2022 4:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
why does opening books take long, and next pages too? couldn't you save next pages into ram while reading current page?


[3/7/2022 4:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I actually had an idea two days ago about this
I'm going to implement it soon


[3/7/2022 4:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
good, then inkbox will be usable


[3/7/2022 4:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Won't change the speed of opening a book much, but page will load in less than a second


[3/7/2022 4:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you try with smaller ebooks? It's faster there


[3/7/2022 4:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Search "jekyll" in online library and download the second book in the list


[3/7/2022 4:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
I opened a random book from recent list, it didn't worker ( last page, no  previous page ), then the book dissapered from the list


[3/7/2022 4:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
a book with only text works great


[3/7/2022 4:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
but thats about it, some images and its dying


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
images will be something to implement too


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
why did the gui


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
died


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm hmm


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
and brightness to 0


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ui freeze?


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
randomly


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
i didn't do anything


[3/7/2022 4:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Did you click "Cancel" in the file dialog?


[3/7/2022 4:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If you do `ps | grep inkbox-bin`, does that give anything?


[3/7/2022 4:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
im in the book that is fast


[3/7/2022 4:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes  2203 root      0:09 /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/inkbox-bin


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
can you try to click somewhere where it would normally do something?


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
nothing


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then, put it to sleep; click the power button


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
and brighntess is 0


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wait 15s
click it again


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
if you have access to the cli it is not dead


[3/7/2022 4:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
the brightness went to 100%, then slowly to 0 and now its sleeping


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
After that, is it the same or can you click and it reacts?


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
but with no sleeping text


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's what I was fearing


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The Nia is now on the unstable devices list


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Try to wake it up


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
how did it launch a word seafrch list


[3/7/2022 4:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
it waked up by his own, i didn't clicked anything


[3/7/2022 4:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
is your kobo plugged in via usb?


[3/7/2022 4:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
no


[3/7/2022 4:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
i disconeccted it becouse everytime i go to home it asks me about usb


[3/7/2022 4:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/7/2022 4:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
can you try to put it to sleep one more time? try not to touch anything except the power button


[3/7/2022 4:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
its sleeps


[3/7/2022 4:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, yeah, but for how long


[3/7/2022 4:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the real moment when it sleeps is 15s after you pressed the power button


[3/7/2022 4:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
otherwise it wakes up again because the kernel says "Resource busy"


[3/7/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
it sleeps


[3/7/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok oof


[3/7/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
now wake it up


[3/7/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
We will try something


[3/7/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
and


[3/7/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
i cant click anything, the brightness button for example


[3/7/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
it went to a book


[3/7/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
why


[3/7/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
another freeze


[3/7/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
cp /etc/init.d/inkbox_gui /tmp
vi /tmp/inkbox_gui
```


[3/7/2022 4:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/7/2022 4:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then
```
mount --bind /tmp/inkbox_gui /etc/init.d/inkbox_gui
rc-service inkbox_gui restart
```


[3/7/2022 4:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
This will launch InkBox GUI with the newer platform plugin I was talking about yesterday


[3/7/2022 4:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, when you run `chroot /kobo /bin/kobo_config.sh` it should output `luna`, right?


[3/7/2022 4:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/7/2022 4:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, so try the steps above


[3/7/2022 4:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'm trying them on my Libra too which has the same problem


[3/7/2022 4:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
i need wifi but i dont have any gui


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
don't you have serial?


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to try these 2 commands from yeastarday?


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
nano sucks on serial


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
use `vi`


[3/7/2022 5:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
also, tip: `reset` so that your terminal isn't messed up anymore


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or maybe you can usbnet?


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will just do it with vim


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will try


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
noooooo


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
serial doesn't like vim


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
only likes vi


[3/7/2022 5:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes vi vi

at what rate did it crash before we tried with the newer platform plugin?


[3/7/2022 5:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
like, 5 mins average, 10 min average, what?


[3/7/2022 5:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I see one possible, hypothetic, crazy solution:
You implement a VNC viewer with FBInk in Rust and we run that one instead of the native platform plugin. In Qt libs I put on the Kobo, there's `libvnc.so`, which allows creating a VNC server to which you can connect with a client. It is used in InkBox OS emulator to interact with the UI because implementing a touch screen in QEMU would be difficult. Assuming that your VNC viewer maps touch input correctly and does not trigger the same kernel bug that the platform plugin did, this would provide a complete, stable and painless UI hardware abstraction layer.


[3/7/2022 5:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe you can look at this project https://github.com/whitequark/rust-vnc


[3/7/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
this will be not efficient, inkbox is now not super fast


[3/7/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then what do you suggest?


[3/7/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk


[3/7/2022 5:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk


[3/7/2022 5:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont know if it was that bad before


[3/7/2022 5:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or we can just go ahead with what we have now


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
it wasn't that bad, you mean all crashes?


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ui freeze


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
some of them were becouse of the pdf - ebup thing


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
on my libra it *is* that bad


[3/7/2022 5:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe with some luck the Nia isn't as much as affected


[3/7/2022 5:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe


[3/7/2022 5:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
can you describe the issue more?


[3/7/2022 5:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i can't, it's just as you said, it freezes randomly for no reason


[3/7/2022 5:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Qt still reacts to input events and button presses, it just doesn't show up on the screen


[3/7/2022 5:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
killall inkbox-bin; env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=vnc:size=768x1024 chroot /kobo /mnt/onboard/.adds/inkbox/inkbox.sh
```
You can try the VNC server this way


[3/7/2022 5:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Just access your Kobo's IP via Wi-Fi or USBNet with a VNC viewer


[3/7/2022 5:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
only qt?


[3/7/2022 5:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe its qt related


[3/7/2022 5:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, it happens when you do too much refreshes with FBInk too


[3/7/2022 5:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
why this problem doesn't occurs on the stock firmware?


[3/7/2022 5:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no idea


[3/7/2022 5:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe do a bug report to the linux kernel or smth?


[3/7/2022 5:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what would that change?

scp it to the Kobo via usbnet

hmm, yeah, that's an input event code I forgot to add


[3/7/2022 10:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
1. Reboot the Kobo.
2. When it says "(initrd) Press any key to stop auto-boot", press a key and login as root.
3. Launch `evtest /dev/input/event0`
4. Put the cover on the device as if you were putting it to sleep
5. Remove the cover from the screen
6. Post output of command in step 3.


[3/7/2022 10:13‚ÄØPM] szybet
can i do this using ssh?


[3/7/2022 10:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

3 click wifi button
4 its freezed at searching for networks
5 press power button for sleep

**After rmmod modules from wifi, suspend works**

I added this to /etc/init.d/sleep_standby.sh
```
if [ "$DEVICE" == "n306" ]; then
        killall -q dhcpcd wpa_supplicant
        ifconfig eth0 down

[3/11/2022 2:23‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
But then we have to handle to mess of reconnecting to the network after waking up ;p


[3/11/2022 2:23‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
`evtest /dev/input/event0`


[3/11/2022 2:24‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Basically, when it `echo mem > /sys/power/state`, the scripts hangs while the device sleeps, then when it wakes up, it executes the rest of the commands in it.


[3/11/2022 2:25‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
yes, very interesting, and no, I don't know why, although I'm sure X has something to do with it


[3/11/2022 2:25‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Emptying the `/tmp/power` file which contains event0 events to avoid memory leak


[3/11/2022 2:27‚ÄØAM] tux_linux (pinned)
Maybe your rootfs' fuse-overlayfs write cache has something in it. Try:
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt
rm -rf /mnt/rootfs/write
sync
umount /mnt
reboot
```


[3/11/2022 2:27‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Yeah, pretty much that (there are system services, like `/etc/init.d/sleep_standby` but they actually just launch the `sleep_standby.sh` script).


[3/11/2022 7:24‚ÄØAM] szybet
The network works after that, it doesnt hang or freeze


[3/11/2022 7:25‚ÄØAM] szybet
And what file is reading  from this? I want to debug why connecting or dosconnecting the cable gets the device from sleep


[3/11/2022 7:25‚ÄØAM] szybet
Maybe ask the guy that developed it?

If there was a option to put the scrollballs even if the menu is off, it would make it the best PDF reader ( for pdfs that are images )

[3/11/2022 7:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[3/11/2022 7:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but you need to specify `-O`


[3/11/2022 7:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, you need to rename `update-n306.isa` to `update.isa`


[3/11/2022 7:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So `wget http://23.163.0.39/bundles/private/update-n306.isa -O /data/firmware/update.isa`


[3/11/2022 7:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
data firmware?

Then `sync` and `restart inkbox_gui`


[3/11/2022 7:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

do you plan to add it?


[3/11/2022 8:13‚ÄØPM] szybet
I would like to add to /etc/ a file that says how much to add to UTC ( -1, +2 etc ) and a script in /opt/bin/ ( propably this patch, you can choose another ) that is runned when wifi connects, it uses /etc/ntp.conf for servers and sets the correct time.


[3/11/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
if you plan to add it in the future, you can build the timezones in gui and then change the file in /etc/


[3/11/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes, that's about the way I was planning to do it


[3/11/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ntpd never worked out for me for some reason but if you've got a command that works I'll take it


[3/11/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
i can make an entire script, you just need to decide the syntax for /etc/utc_time.conf ( for example )


[3/11/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Oh; I can do it, this was the second part of my goals for today


[3/11/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But if you want to contribute you can do it


[3/11/2022 8:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
sure


[3/11/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But I was more thinking of something like /etc/localtime and symlinks


[3/11/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But since the rootfs is r/o by default, it will be difficult


[3/11/2022 8:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
well, for this you need write privileges


[3/11/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And we can mount the rootfs r/w, but it is usually never done
So I'd prefer not do it


[3/11/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe it could be possible to use bind mounts


[3/11/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe do tihs the same way you handle the config for the gui?


[3/11/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
there is `/usr/share/zoneinfo` already there


[3/11/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
inkbox:/# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 14:20:25 EST 2022
inkbox:/#
```
Awesome


[3/11/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's the correct time here


[3/11/2022 8:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will try it for me


[3/11/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
yea. this is working


[3/11/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So maybe create `/run/localtime` or `/tmp/localtime` which is a symlink to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/your/timezone` and bind-mount that file to an empty file named localtime in /etc


[3/11/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
does this need rw filesystem?


[3/11/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[3/11/2022 8:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
um what


[3/11/2022 8:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
inkbox:/# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /tmp/localtime
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 19:22:13 UTC 2022
inkbox:/# mount --bind /tmp/localtime /etc/localtime
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 14:22:26 EST 2022
inkbox:/# 
```
This works


[3/11/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
using this changed the time to the correct one, no need to move UTC hours


[3/11/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, so there's only ntp sync to implement really


[3/11/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
give me 15 minutes


[3/11/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
is `/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh` the main script when connecting to wifi?


[3/11/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe a script that reads conf info from `/data/config/19-timezone/config` which contains timezone config, then syncs ntp and sets timezone in /etc/localtime


[3/11/2022 8:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'd rather do that from the Qt code


[3/11/2022 8:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But one or the other works I guess


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Doing it from shell might be a better idea actually


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, it is


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
when its connected, i just need to add one line of code


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe launch `/usr/local/bin/ntpsync.sh` after udhcpc/dhcpcd complete


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
and one file to /etc


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`touch etc/localtime`


[3/11/2022 8:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
isin't needed


[3/11/2022 8:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Will be more portable


[3/11/2022 8:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If you want to run it from shell for example


[3/11/2022 8:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe name it `timesync.sh` actually since it also changes the timezone


[3/11/2022 8:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Oh, never mind


[3/11/2022 8:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
look

[3/11/2022 8:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats everything whots needed


[3/11/2022 8:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
There should be a system service that would change the timezone based on the config


[3/11/2022 8:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
why is the time in the GUI and cmd date diffrent...


[3/11/2022 8:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Check `/etc/init.d/hostname` for example and create `/etc/init.d/timezone` which would change the timezone


[3/11/2022 8:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
first i woul need the config


[3/11/2022 8:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then chmod +x and symlink `/etc/init.d/timezone` to `/etc/runlevels/boot/timezone` to make it run at boot


[3/11/2022 8:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
At `/data/config`?


[3/11/2022 8:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, I don't know how to handle that
Also, the timezones list will be massive


[3/11/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'd suggest that `/data/config/19-timezone/config` would point to a path in the rootfs, for example `/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York`


[3/11/2022 8:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then the timezone service would symlink /tmp/localtime to the file specified in the config


[3/11/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
make a search bar


[3/11/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you implement this, not me.......


[3/11/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
this would probably be the most complicated thing ever


[3/11/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, idk


[3/11/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
depends on what we are talking about


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe something similar to book search


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
does this ln -s dissapear after reboot?


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh thats the problem


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's why we need to put it in a system service


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so it runs at each boot


[3/11/2022 8:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Actually, it might even be better if it was in the initrd


[3/11/2022 8:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
hm?


[3/11/2022 8:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, some things like the ENCRYPT_LOCK flag which locks down the device for a day if the user enters too much wrong passphrases to unlock their encrypted storage would be affected


[3/11/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But that's based on the epoch UNIX time


[3/11/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So it might not be affected actually


[3/11/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok, it won't be affected, I just checked


[3/11/2022 8:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So we can do this in the rootfs


[3/11/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
if the file ends normarly without exit, then its connected? 
https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh#L78


[3/11/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, otherwise the script calls `exit 1` if there is an error


[3/11/2022 8:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
like here https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/5815843d6209188b8d07994bc47b3a1c3b85ca0b/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh#L65


[3/11/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay, so just add `ntpd -n -q &` at the end


[3/11/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
or without &


[3/11/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Not the &


[3/11/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
not at the end


[3/11/2022 8:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
yea, if the parrent exits it will kill him


[3/11/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
why?


[3/11/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe you can


[3/11/2022 8:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
why why not


[3/11/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i'm dumb https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/5815843d6209188b8d07994bc47b3a1c3b85ca0b/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh#L74


[3/11/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
$? is exit status of fi


[3/11/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wow.....


[3/11/2022 8:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
O.o?


[3/11/2022 8:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it will always quit on success if the dhcp request fails


[3/11/2022 8:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
well, then repair it


[3/11/2022 8:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i'll make this a var real quick


[3/11/2022 8:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
you can add  `ntpd -n -q` too


[3/11/2022 8:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# test=1
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# if test=1; then false; fi
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# $?
-ash: 1: not found
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# 

inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# if test=1; then true; fi
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# $?
-ash: 0: not found
inkbox:/usr/share/openrc/support# 
```
Actually, it seems I'm wrong


[3/11/2022 8:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
and /etc/ntp.conf

server 0.pool.ntp.org
server 1.pool.ntp.org
server 2.pool.ntp.org
server 3.pool.ntp.org


[3/11/2022 8:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont understand at all


[3/11/2022 8:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Based on my logic, $? should always be 0 since the fi command is successful


[3/11/2022 8:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But it seems that ash is smart enough not to give fi an exit status


[3/11/2022 8:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You can add it at the end it's fine


[3/11/2022 8:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait


[3/11/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
couldn't we just symlink /etc/timezone to /data/config/19-timezone/config?


[3/11/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what?


[3/11/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
or do you want in this config to write the path in text


[3/11/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`/etc/localtime` to `/data/config/19-timezone/config`?


[3/11/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, or this?


[3/11/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`/data/config/19-timezone/config` would need to contain the contents of the corresponding file in /usr/share/zoneinfo


[3/11/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
or maybe make it a double symlink


[3/11/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
so a symlink could be good


[3/11/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i'm trying it now


[3/11/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
and a system service wouldn't be needed


[3/11/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
inkbox:/# ls -shal /etc/localtime
     0 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root          31 Mar 11 14:53 /etc/localtime -> /data/config/19-timezone/config
inkbox:/# ls -shal /data/config/19-timezone/config 
     0 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root          36 Mar 11 14:52 /data/config/19-timezone/config -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 14:53:59 EST 2022
inkbox:/# 
```
It seems to work


[3/11/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Go ahead


[3/11/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
so a system service isin't needed


[3/11/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
great


[3/11/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ouch
```
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 14:53:30 EST 2022
inkbox:/# chroot /kobo
inkbox:/# date
Fri Mar 11 19:54:37 UTC 2022
inkbox:/# 
```


[3/11/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It seems it isn't working across chroots
and /kobo is the GUI chroot


[3/11/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
this explains why the date isin't correctly showing on the gui


[3/11/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe a reboot is needed?


[3/11/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Which, of course, doesn't contain zoneinfo (and the squashfs containing that filesystem isn't upgradable)
```
inkbox:/# ls usr/share/zoneinfo
ls: usr/share/zoneinfo: No such file or directory
inkbox:/# 
```


[3/11/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i would doubt that


[3/11/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe copy the file to /kobo


[3/11/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
its only 3 KB


[3/11/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe something similar to this
`[ ! -e "/kobo/opt/version" ] && touch /kobo/opt/version`


[3/11/2022 8:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
In that file https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/master/etc/init.d/inkbox_gui


[3/11/2022 8:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe a mount bind?


[3/11/2022 8:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
[ ! -e "/kobo/usr/share/zoneinfo" ] && mkdir -p /kobo/usr/share/zoneinfo
[ ! -e "/kobo/etc/localtime" ] && touch /kobo/etc/localtime
mount --bind /usr/share/zoneinfo /kobo/usr/share/zoneinfo
mount --bind /etc/localtime /kobo/etc/localtime
```


[3/11/2022 9:00‚ÄØPM] szybet
exactly


[3/11/2022 9:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll add that to the inkbox_gui, unless you want to do it


[3/11/2022 9:00‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Insert the above code under that line
`[ ! -e "/kobo/bin/kobo_config.sh" ] && touch /kobo/bin/kobo_config.sh`


[3/11/2022 9:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
you mean?


[3/11/2022 9:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
`/etc/init.d/inkbox_gui`


[3/11/2022 9:01‚ÄØPM] szybet
?


[3/11/2022 9:01‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Since you are already working on other files, maybe it's good to have that in one commit only

[3/11/2022 9:02‚ÄØPM] szybet
can you verify?


[3/11/2022 9:03‚ÄØPM] szybet
on which files?


[3/11/2022 9:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
sleep_standby.sh for example
Well, to avoid a merge by pulling my commits


[3/11/2022 9:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
Its propaply the only one
maybe connect_to_network.sh with the ntpd one line


[3/11/2022 9:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It seems fine
Now we need to tell it to auto-reconnect


[3/11/2022 9:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
and /etc/ntp.conf


[3/11/2022 9:04‚ÄØPM] szybet
wake standby script


[3/11/2022 9:04‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[3/11/2022 9:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
turning on the modules and interphace isin't enough?


[3/11/2022 9:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
is it enough on your kobo?


[3/11/2022 9:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
i can check that, but my kobo never recconects to a wifi


[3/11/2022 9:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok, I think I will do the modifications here and mention you in the commit


[3/11/2022 9:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
so you will push them all?


[3/11/2022 9:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah


[3/11/2022 9:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
sure, it will be cleaner


[3/11/2022 9:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
send me the modified files (not just their contents, the file itself) and I'll put them in my tree


[3/11/2022 9:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
so:
connect_to_network.sh
/etc/ntp.conf
wake standby sh
sleep standby sh


[3/11/2022 9:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
and there is the symlink of /etc/timezone to /data/config


[3/11/2022 9:10‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
/etc/localtime you mean?


[3/11/2022 9:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes

[3/11/2022 9:10‚ÄØPM] szybet

{Reactions}
üëç 

[3/11/2022 9:11‚ÄØPM] szybet
i cant send it, so you need to symlink it on your own


[3/11/2022 9:11‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
sure


[3/11/2022 9:11‚ÄØPM] szybet
Pinned a message.


[3/11/2022 9:12‚ÄØPM] szybet
```
% sshfs root@192.168.0.1:/ /mnt/Partition
root@192.168.0.1's password:

why sshfs is not working?


[3/11/2022 9:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what are you trying to do?


[3/11/2022 9:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i think it needs a helper on the client


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
did you modify the files directly on the kobo?


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
sshfs is cool


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i know


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
no, it workes on nickel


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will scp


[3/11/2022 9:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
then no idea


[3/11/2022 9:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux (pinned)
```
mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt
mksquashfs /mnt/rootfs/write /tmp/rootfs-write.sqsh
umount /mnt
```


[3/11/2022 9:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
That will take all the files you modified


[3/11/2022 9:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
why not simply `ifsctl mnt rootfs rw`


[3/11/2022 9:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that mounts the rootfs rw


[3/11/2022 9:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
what I wrote above takes all the write cache and compresses it into a squashfs


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so if you modified `/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_wifi.sh`, `/mnt/rootfs/write` will contain a copy of this file that is modified
it's why it's called overlayfs


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh okay


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it overlays a writeable part over a read-only filesystem (squashfs)


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
Pinned a message.


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
cool, but i already did ifsctl


[3/11/2022 9:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it has nothing to do with that


[3/11/2022 9:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
when you issue `ifsctl mnt rootfs rw`, it remounts the rootfs rw and all the writes are redirected to `[p3]/rootfs/write`

so if you do `touch /test`, a file named `test` will be at `[p3]/rootfs/write/test`


[3/11/2022 9:18‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
and the rootfs squashfs will stay the same


[3/11/2022 9:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[3/11/2022 9:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's why earlier you were wondering why your connect_to_wifi script didn't have the contents of the latest commits; because you had modified it before


[3/11/2022 9:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the modified version takes precedence on the existing version


[3/11/2022 9:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh...


[3/11/2022 9:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
i forgot about a line in connect_to_network.sh, good that im testing that

[3/11/2022 9:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
have you tested if it reconnects automatically on wake up?


[3/11/2022 9:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
it does not even go to sleep, i need to add `killall -q dhcpcd wpa_supplicant`


[3/11/2022 9:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ok


[3/11/2022 9:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
well, if i kill them and then launch there is no way they will reconect


[3/11/2022 9:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
before ifconfig wifi_dev down i guess?


[3/11/2022 9:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes


[3/11/2022 9:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, so then we can work with the available info at `/data/config/17-wifi_connection_information`


[3/11/2022 9:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And re-launch `/usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh` with those strings


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh i can do this


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it will mess up the tree


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
in a seperate file? like recconect.sh?


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
you mean git? i can send you the file


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah ok


[3/11/2022 9:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, I'll send you my sleep_standby.sh script before


[3/11/2022 9:26‚ÄØPM] szybet

they are the same, i used the one from git


[3/11/2022 9:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I added a check to see if the interface is up or not before removing modules, etc.


[3/11/2022 9:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh okay


[3/11/2022 9:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no, it's the one with my additions + the wifi down part you added earlier


[3/11/2022 9:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
what about 
```
if [ "${DEVICE}" == "n705" ] || [ "${DEVICE}" == "n905b" ] || [ "${DEVICE}" == "n905c" ] || [ "${DEVICE}" == "n613" ] || [ "${DEVICE}" == "n437" ]; then
    wlarm_le down

how to check if to restore wifi, when going from sleep?


[3/11/2022 9:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
```
if [ "$(cat /sys/class/net/${WIFI_DEV}/operstate)" == "up" ]; then
  echo "true" > /tmp/was_connected_to_wifi
fi
```


[3/11/2022 9:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And deal with that file on wake up
Don't forget to `rm -f` it once you've read its contents


[3/11/2022 9:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's actually `/sys/class/net/${WIFI_DEV}/operstate)`; added it above


[3/11/2022 9:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
```
if [ "$(cat /tmp/was_connected_to_wifi)" == "true" ]; then
    ifconfig "${WIFI_DEV}" up
    insmod "${WIFI_MODULE}" 2> /dev/null
    insmod "${SDIO_WIFI_PWR_MODULE}" 2> /dev/null
    ESSID=`cat /data/config/17-wifi_connection_information/essid`
    PASSPHRASE=`cat /data/config/17-wifi_connection_information/passphrase`
    /usr/local/bin/wifi/connect_to_network.sh "${ESSID}"  "${PASSPHRASE}" 
    rm -f /tmp/was_connected_to_wifi
fi
```


[3/11/2022 9:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will test it now


[3/11/2022 9:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
better to use `$(command)` in place of backticks
and `if grep -q "true" /tmp/was_connected_to_wifi`


[3/11/2022 9:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
also, it's in the wrong order


[3/11/2022 9:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
:/...


[3/11/2022 9:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[3/11/2022 9:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
insmod sdio_wifi_pwr, then wifi module, then wlarm_le up for devices that need it, then interface up, then connect


[3/11/2022 9:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh right


[3/11/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need it to change it to the grep?


[3/11/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
if you want I can do it here after


[3/11/2022 9:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the important thing would be to get the snippet of code working


[3/11/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
can you look at the "word search" and "pages are switching like crazy" problems i described before?


[3/11/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
currently doing timezone stuff


[3/11/2022 9:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[3/11/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
did it happen with the latest gui bundle? maybe the speed of the page turning has improved it


[3/11/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
hmm, i will check it


[3/11/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
but a limiter for the page change is needed anyway


[3/11/2022 9:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/11/2022 9:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
it works


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
nice


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
but it takes a while


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
how much time does it take?


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
ah


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk, 90 s?


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
we can probably run it in the background


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
you mean


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
?


[3/11/2022 9:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
if the user tries to connect to wifi in the gui during that period, we can show a message like "connection already in progress" or something


[3/11/2022 9:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes you can, a simple ps | grep connect_to_network could make it work


[3/11/2022 9:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i was thinking of something more reliable than that ;p


[3/11/2022 9:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but yeah, it's the idea


[3/11/2022 9:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
FWIW, since the GUI is running in a chroot, it needs to send commands to a fifo to get them executed in the rootfs
That's how Wi-Fi connection is handled: https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/rootfs/blob/5815843d6209188b8d07994bc47b3a1c3b85ca0b/etc/init.d/ibxd#L67-L77


[3/11/2022 9:55‚ÄØPM] szybet
complicated


[3/11/2022 9:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, but otherwise it's really a mess


[3/11/2022 9:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so the GUI has a while true loop which checks the contents of the wifi_connected_successfully file and stops when there is something like 'false' or 'true' in it


[3/11/2022 9:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yay

yes

nice


[3/11/2022 10:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I wonder if it should be `/tmp/was_connected_to_wifi` or `/run/was_connected_to_wifi`


[3/11/2022 10:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
idk, you decide


[3/11/2022 10:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, ibxd puts wifi_connected_successfully in run

it should be more reliable

ok, so I'll try to implement some sort of 'blocker' while it's turning the pages


[3/11/2022 10:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
this is fine, but that means it won't be able to go to sleep until it has reconnected to wi-fi

Since it's `sleep_standby`'s job


[3/11/2022 10:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe a button in settings to choose if it would recconect?


[3/11/2022 10:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, but if you move around and don't have access to the network anymore


[3/11/2022 10:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe a 'cancel reconnect' or something


[3/11/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] szybet
is it normal that connecting the usb cable gets the device back from sleep?


[3/11/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe the user would click one time to connect to Wi-Fi after waking up, it would say "Click again to cancel reconnect" and on the second click on the Wi-Fi icon it would cancel


[3/11/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[3/11/2022 10:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
does that even in Nickel

I highly doubt he has an idea


[3/11/2022 10:27‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

this


[3/11/2022 10:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think suspend is fixed for good, becouse of wifi


[3/11/2022 10:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you mean, in Qt gui too?


[3/11/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
well, in qt gui only?


[3/11/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so that means you have the problem I have on my Libra
but I never disable X on my Libra
so I think it is permanent


[3/11/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh; awesome


[3/11/2022 10:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
propably


[3/11/2022 10:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, not awesome, but it's nice to know that it can probably be circumvented on the libra by disabling x11


[3/11/2022 10:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/11/2022 10:30‚ÄØPM] szybet

so how do i update the rootfs without u-boot?


[3/11/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you technically can but load busybox binary into ram before (just run `busybox`) without any arguments
then
`busybox sync`
`busybox reboot`


[3/11/2022 11:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it's not clean, it's an horrible idea, but I guess it does the job

nope, nothing worked


[3/11/2022 11:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will tommorow open in and do it properly


[3/11/2022 11:17‚ÄØPM] szybet
what is the best way to do this ( without opening )?


[3/11/2022 11:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
did it transfer?


[3/11/2022 11:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/11/2022 11:18‚ÄØPM] szybet
it did ( i think ) , then everything stopped working and i couldn't  the openssl file


[3/11/2022 11:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you should have scp'ed them at the same time

[3/11/2022 11:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
after error code 3, does it reboot or go shutdown?

You can try encrypted storage if you want btw


[3/12/2022 6:56‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
I updated the GUI bundle at the usual URL


[3/12/2022 6:57‚ÄØAM] tux_linux

maybe the nia is tightener


[3/12/2022 1:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
usually I start if a knife, and once some place in the back has enough damage I can fit a credit card to open the entire device


[3/12/2022 1:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, it isn't ideal, but that's what happened with my Libra


[3/12/2022 1:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
a knife will damage it too


[3/12/2022 1:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
there's something called a spudger

this ***e***   üòÜ


[3/12/2022 2:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Whoa


[3/12/2022 2:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It should not be like that


[3/12/2022 2:17‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Do you have x enabled?


[3/12/2022 2:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont really know if this patched the issue


[3/12/2022 2:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
disabled


[3/12/2022 2:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, it disables the button when you click it and enables it back when the page is loaded


[3/12/2022 2:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
If that doesn't fix your issue then nothing can


[3/12/2022 2:21‚ÄØPM] szybet
so in theory if i spam click the button it shouldn't switch more than 1 page?


[3/12/2022 2:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No
It will switch one, two, three pages once the page before has been correctly loaded, although might be not fully printed on the screen yet


[3/12/2022 2:22‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So it ensures each page is properly loaded before loading a new one


[3/12/2022 2:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
so it doesn't work


[3/12/2022 2:25‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, use the go to function if you want to spam page turns


[3/12/2022 2:25‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean that propably when using the reader some times it will jump 2 pages


[3/12/2022 2:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It never does that on my devices


[3/12/2022 2:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe i click not exact


[3/12/2022 2:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
its not a big issue


[3/12/2022 2:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok, what about Wi-Fi reconnection on wake up?


[3/12/2022 2:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will check it, first how do i set the timezone now


[3/12/2022 2:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
from cli


[3/12/2022 2:28‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You need to symlink a zoneinfo file to `/data/config/19-timezone/config`
Use ln -sf


[3/12/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
ln -sf /data/config/19-timezone/config /usr/share/zoneinfo/Poland    ?


[3/12/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The opposite


[3/12/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But yeah


[3/12/2022 2:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Poland /data/config/19-timezone/config`


[3/12/2022 2:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay

The device will sometimes not go to sleep when the modules are loaded, even if the interface is down
/mnt/data/projects/git/conversations/media/1-FC70C


[3/13/2022 12:29‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
No, it's because the operstate file in sysfs shows down even if the modules are loaded and the interface is up, it shows "up" only when the interface has got an IP


[3/13/2022 12:29‚ÄØAM] szybet
its still if its down


[3/13/2022 12:30‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
?


[3/13/2022 12:31‚ÄØAM] szybet
yes, and?


[3/13/2022 12:32‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Well, if you searched for networks but didn't connect, it will fail to sleep


[3/13/2022 12:33‚ÄØAM] szybet
look
1 interface is down
2 modules are loaded
3 sleep doesn't work


[3/13/2022 12:33‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Yes


[3/13/2022 12:33‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Idk


[3/13/2022 12:34‚ÄØAM] szybet
"tap again" where to tap? at the wifi button?


[3/13/2022 12:34‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Maybe get out the block of code removing the WiFi modules from the if statement and put it before


[3/13/2022 12:34‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Yes? Isn't that intuitive?


[3/13/2022 12:35‚ÄØAM] szybet
i ask becouse it doesn't work. when i click again it shows the "searching for network" label


[3/13/2022 12:35‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Yes, that's what it's supposed to do ...?


[3/13/2022 12:36‚ÄØAM] szybet
then it will rm them 2 times sometimes. But it doesn't matter, do as you would like, its just code preferency look


[3/13/2022 12:36‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
I'll do that later tonight


[3/13/2022 12:37‚ÄØAM] szybet
Tap again to cancel, not to search for networks?


[3/13/2022 12:37‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
To cancel the reconnection


[3/13/2022 12:37‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
And connect to another network

could i add a service that will check the power button, and if it will clicked it will stop wake_standby and start sleep_standby? it would remove the problem that after going from sleep it cant go to sleep again?


[3/13/2022 2:03‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
That would cause some unwanted problems


[3/13/2022 2:49‚ÄØAM] tux_linux

But if you can, please look and tell me if you see something in the commit that should not be there or if it is missing.
The modules removal part is 100% fixed now, but going to sleep while reconnecting still gives problems.

also, how bad is porting a qt cpp app to kobo?


[3/13/2022 7:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
once you have the setup, it's easy


[3/13/2022 7:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
1. Put it to sleep and wake it up, not connected to any Wi-Fi network. Should work as usual.
2. Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Then, put it to sleep and wake it up.
3. Wait until the Wi-Fi has reconnected (the Wi-Fi icon updates each 10s) and then put it to sleep.
4. Wake it up and put it back to sleep again **while** it's reconnecting. Then wake it up. It should not attempt to connect to any network at this point.


[3/13/2022 7:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
4 doesn't work


[3/13/2022 7:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
which part?


[3/13/2022 7:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
4.


[3/13/2022 7:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, it fails at which sub-step?


[3/13/2022 7:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
you know that nia will not go to sleep if modules are loaded?


[3/13/2022 7:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes


[3/13/2022 7:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
They are removed

Even if the interface is down, they will be removed


[3/13/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
it simply doesn't respond for the power button


[3/13/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
no sleeping splash screen


[3/13/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
can you still interact with the ui?


[3/13/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
how much time did you wait after it woke up and started reconnecting?


[3/13/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
30s


[3/13/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe it had already reconnected


[3/13/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean


[3/13/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
after going back from sleep i clicked the power button instantly


[3/13/2022 7:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
but no reaction


[3/13/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I think it's at least 3-4 secs before it can react, it has to go through other steps in the scripts before


[3/13/2022 7:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I'll try on other models


[3/13/2022 7:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
nope, still doesn't react


[3/13/2022 7:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok. Please **reboot**, then do the following:
```
cp /etc/init.d/sleep_standby.sh /etc/init.d/wake_standby.sh /tmp
vi /tmp/sleep_standby.sh # Replace first line with '#!/bin/bash -x'
vi /tmp/wake_standby.sh # Replace first line with '#!/bin/bash -x'
mount --bind /tmp/sleep_standby.sh /etc/init.d/sleep_standby.sh
mount --bind /tmp/wake_standby.sh /etc/init.d/wake_standby.sh
killall sleep_standby.sh wake_standby.sh # If nothing found, try to find processes with `ps' and kill the PID related to those scripts
rc-service sleep_standby stop
rc-service wake_standby stop
rc-service sleep_standby start -d
```
Then redo the steps above and post terminal output. It's a truckload of info, so it will probably be useful for debugging.


[3/13/2022 7:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Actually, only do step 3 and 4.


[3/13/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
have you tried pressing it more than one time?


[3/13/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes, and then after 2 minutes it gos to sleep and doesn't want to go back


[3/13/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
well, that is a kernel issue
no idea


[3/13/2022 7:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The early wake-up part is handled by the kernel
If the screen didn't refresh when you clicked the power button, it's a kernel issue


[3/13/2022 8:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
it works, i needed to clear the write cache something

usb storage will not work with usbnet, right?


[3/13/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yes, but it removes usbnet modules before inserting mass storage ones


[3/13/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so you lose usbnet while in mass storage


[3/13/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it restarts it after if you have it enabled


[3/13/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
so nothing works?


[3/13/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
not while you're in mass storage


[3/13/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[3/13/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
you can ssh that way

sshfs would be nice to get working

you can try

I'm planning to release 1.9 soon, since we have pretty much everything ready.
Any features/fixes/something I forgot about?


[3/14/2022 10:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
- sliders too small
+ settings arrows to choose numbers are to small
- last book menu is simply not good
- improve wifi control maybe?
- file chooser ü§Æ 

those are the most important in my opinion


[3/14/2022 10:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
those will be for 2.0


[3/14/2022 10:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

And this?


[3/17/2022 1:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
That's to disable waking up the device with the touchscreen


[3/17/2022 1:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It only allows the power button/Hall sensor to wake it up


[3/17/2022 1:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
Oh okay


[3/22/2022 12:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
Now its confirmed

When sleeping the touch screen is still on, and can awake the device


[3/22/2022 12:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
Any fix for that? I think that /SYS/power/xxx should disable it


[3/22/2022 12:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
I should create my own kernel


[3/22/2022 12:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You need to echo 1 to power-extended


[3/22/2022 1:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
I think that the sleep service does that

Don't forget to do this again before you compile it

Did you change the location of the initrd folder in the kernel config?
Is `/home/build/inkbox` a working symlink?


[3/26/2022 11:56‚ÄØAM] szybet
yes, otherwise it doesn't compile at all


[3/26/2022 11:57‚ÄØAM] szybet
initrd? where to change it?


[3/26/2022 11:57‚ÄØAM] szybet
its in the kernel repo


[3/26/2022 11:58‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
It's fine
Since you have a symlink, it works


[3/26/2022 11:58‚ÄØAM] szybet
the kernel size is always 9,8 M


[3/26/2022 12:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
is the dd kernel command good?


[3/26/2022 12:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
i first did
```
dd if=inkbox_maybe_working.img of=kernel_inkbox_working count=10000000 skip=81920 iflag=skip_bytes,count_bytes
```
to get the working kernel from a working inkbox image


[3/26/2022 12:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
then 
```
sudo dd if=kernel_inkbox_working of=/dev/sdd bs=512 seek=81920
```


[3/26/2022 12:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
but nothing


[3/26/2022 12:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
no change


[3/26/2022 12:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
Maybe you could compile the kernel... there is maybe something wrong with my linux on pc


[3/26/2022 1:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
its ```83000000``` booting from but we are writing to ```81920```


[3/26/2022 2:08‚ÄØPM] szybet
Why root at the end od the command and not std, it is like on your github


[3/26/2022 2:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
83000000 is the memory address


[3/26/2022 2:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes, I can try


[3/26/2022 2:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
So?


[3/26/2022 3:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
what the fuck is going on


[3/26/2022 3:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
i compiled the kernel on my brothers laptop


[3/26/2022 3:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
same device, same os but its a bit older and with less packages installed


[3/26/2022 3:15‚ÄØPM] szybet

How much time since you rebooted your laptop


[3/26/2022 3:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I had no way of knowing this

i have tryied yestarday, rebooted today, rebooted, and again


[3/26/2022 3:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
so no, no reboot has to do with it

As for the sleep/touchscreen issues, I don't know what to do, even KOReader seems to do it all the time: https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/fb45576429b4302cd7dd7f09999206a5d60e9960/frontend/device/kobo/device.lua#L762-L775


[3/26/2022 5:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think i can figure it out adding one kernel option with the touchscreen

can you try it?

[3/26/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
hmm


[3/26/2022 5:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
do you need a kernel? i can compile one, just give me the config file

[3/26/2022 6:07‚ÄØPM] szybet

[3/26/2022 6:07‚ÄØPM] szybet
just npo


[3/26/2022 6:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
i will add this to the guide later: 
install distrobox:  https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox
create a image:
```
distrobox-create --image debian:latest
distrobox-enter debian-latest
```
install some packages:
``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install bc git build-essential u-boot-tools libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
create the symlink:
```
sudo mkdir -p /home/build/inkbox/
sudo ln -s path_to_kernel_repo /home/build/inkbox/kernel
```

thats it, now cpp magic won't waste your time


[3/26/2022 6:59‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

wakeup becouse of touchscreen


[3/26/2022 7:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
maybe it puts it to sleep automatically if it somehow detects that the wakeup source was the touchscreen?

it will help to find the touchscreen driver name, probably


[3/26/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
do you have one?


[3/26/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
there are like 5 main chips on the device, and 3 small, one smaller than a diode

no, I wanted to know if the kernel 'panic' had an effect on the working system

like, if it went by without issue or it required a reboot

it forced a reboot

i see a file called delete_device in the i2c parrent, i think this is the proper way to remove a device

Be careful with that, sometimes you can physically damage the device if you do the wrong thing

yes but actually yes and no... most important if the regulators have good maximum voltages assing

well, first you need to give instructions how to create modules.sqash


[3/26/2022 10:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
just modules_install and then the whole directory into squash?

make a pull request when you can


[3/27/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe not today, tommorow


[3/27/2022 8:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Can you pull the kernel repo and see if the kernel still boots with the new 203K binary (qr-to-png) I added?


[3/27/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] szybet
tommorow propably


[3/27/2022 8:50‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
if i compile it for you?


[3/27/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
also the kernel size... max is 10,5M currently its 9,8M, and i want to add alsa and soundcard support


[3/27/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
this doesn't look good for the future


[3/27/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] szybet
then propably today


[3/27/2022 8:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
0.7M is probably already too small


[3/27/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe you can put them in a `[p1]/modules` folder, I don't know


[3/27/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
what is next to the kernel?


[3/27/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
partition 3 iirc


[3/27/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
waveform?


[3/27/2022 8:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
not good


[3/27/2022 8:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah, well, when I set up a partition layout I didn't think the kernels would become so huge


[3/27/2022 8:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
compiling right now


[3/27/2022 8:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
there are 2 options:
1 we make the partition layout in a other way now
2 in the future we will do this anyway, e-readers are becoming more complicated and have more features. Even never kernels are bigger


[3/27/2022 8:55‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the thing is that I don't want to re-upload a system image for existing supported models


[3/27/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
now not many people use inkbox, it will not hurt many. in the future it will


[3/27/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
i guess 10.5M is also really huge for a kernel on an embedded device


[3/27/2022 8:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
when you think about it, it eats 10M of your RAM


[3/27/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so it is probably not a good idea to keep it growing


[3/27/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
we'll have to find other ways to do what we want to do


[3/27/2022 8:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
modules etc on a partition


[3/27/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
the thing is that each device has different modules


[3/27/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
painful to update


[3/27/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
but maybe


[3/27/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
just update with the rootfs


[3/27/2022 8:58‚ÄØPM] szybet

Right?


[4/1/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] szybet
i had scalling issues in epubs too. no images, not enough text and the "end of document" toast appeared after every page change. i think it happened in the newest gui bundle

yes, but im saying now about another bug


[4/1/2022 10:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Uh, not the end of document thing. I read on InkBox today and ePUB is fine


[4/1/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Not enough text, you can change ePUB page size in Settings

i tryied, nothing


[4/1/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

qtextedit

another qtextedit


[4/1/2022 10:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
this could be done?


[4/1/2022 10:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
i think mupdf gives a reference to the image


[4/1/2022 10:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
if its html, maybe just use qtbrowser or something like that?


[4/1/2022 10:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, qtwebengine doesn't work on kobos


[4/1/2022 10:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

Please use this script syntax:
`"${VAR}"` for var expansion (double quote unless you know it will be an int)
`"$(command)"` for invoking command in a var

[4/1/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes it is needed


[4/1/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
When there is an event in event0 but it is not the power button or sleep cover


[4/1/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Sometimes it can be the gyroscope for example


[4/1/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Otherwise you will get a memory leak at some point


[4/1/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
but after detecting something it will continue to run the code after it?


[4/1/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It continues/restarts the while loop

You know what inotifywait does, right?

`Wait for a particular event on a file or set of files.`

[4/2/2022 2:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
the part with while is not working


[4/2/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
if it gets there, it will not suspend, just loop through and there will be x fails in suspend_stats


[4/2/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
and things in go_sleep like echo and cat are my debugging things


[4/2/2022 2:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe you can just store the status of echo command in a var
${?}


[4/2/2022 2:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
will this help with the problem?


[4/2/2022 2:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[4/2/2022 2:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But it will make more sense probably


[4/2/2022 2:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay, i will implement it after it will work


[4/2/2022 2:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
When you write to sysfs you don't need to sync
Files there are not real files, they are linked directly to the kernel


[4/2/2022 2:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
sync is for the filesystem


[4/2/2022 2:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, put it only once


[4/2/2022 2:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
okay


[4/2/2022 2:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Hmm
I would add something blocking that would prevent executing go_sleep if it's already running
But maybe the while loop already prevents that


[4/2/2022 2:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
there is no &, so its only running once


[4/2/2022 2:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You can use sh -x to help you debug


[4/2/2022 2:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's really useful


[4/2/2022 2:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
what it does?


[4/2/2022 2:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Try it


[4/2/2022 2:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
sh -x script.sh


[4/2/2022 2:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, maybe more bash -x
Btw, if possible, always use /bin/sh as it is faster than bash
If you need arrays, etc. it's okay but ideally the faster it runs the better


[4/2/2022 2:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats helpfull


[4/2/2022 2:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
üëç


[4/2/2022 2:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
this is weird


[4/2/2022 2:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
the script if it goes to this loop, it cant suspend itself


[4/2/2022 2:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
but then i relaunch the whole script, it suspends normal


[4/2/2022 2:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I don't understand


[4/2/2022 2:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe now


[4/2/2022 2:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
what does `/tmp/sleep_mode`?


[4/2/2022 2:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Tells other scripts/services that it's going/in sleep mode IIRC
It is necessary


[4/2/2022 2:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
and `/tmp/sleep_standby`?


[4/2/2022 2:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Used for WiFi reconnection


[4/2/2022 3:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
WEIRD


[4/2/2022 3:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
nothing makes sense


[4/2/2022 3:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
i needed to add:
```

        kill -STOP $(pidof 2048-bin 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
```
to make it go to sleep after the error with touch


[4/2/2022 3:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
why?


[4/2/2022 3:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Wait, where's the sleep call in this code?


[4/2/2022 3:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
where?


[4/2/2022 3:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
i added this to `while` and now it goes to sleep, and does not loop itself


[4/2/2022 3:43‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well it makes no sense


[4/2/2022 3:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
but it works


[4/2/2022 3:44‚ÄØPM] szybet

[4/2/2022 3:44‚ÄØPM] szybet

becouse the wifi mark appears sometimes when launching the kill thing

`fbink` without arguments will print the full help


[4/2/2022 4:02‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I am not sure I am ready to merge this
It will need a LOT of testing, and it seems it affects other devices too
It will be something to test for 2.0 release

it needs testing, sure


[4/2/2022 4:03‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
can't you put touch_issue_fix.sh into a function?


[4/2/2022 4:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
this will load it to ram, the code will be rarely used, the code in this file will be uglier


[4/2/2022 4:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
why uglier?


[4/2/2022 4:05‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
and it will load the file to ram anyway


[4/2/2022 4:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
really?

20 lines of kill

[4/2/2022 4:06‚ÄØPM] szybet
well okay


[4/2/2022 4:06‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it will load <1K to RAM, so I guess it is negligible

maybe dont disable the button, but give an if at the slot that its executing when clicked?

already tried


[4/2/2022 4:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
and?


[4/2/2022 4:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But the function is blocking, so it always finishes executing before launching a new one, and it remembers at the same time how many times you clicked on the button.
It's like a queue
So it never worked


[4/2/2022 4:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
??? it can execute to the end, but you simply disable the code in it

I updated the `build_u-boot.sh` script in the kernel repo; building U-Boot is now much easier


[4/13/2022 1:33‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Example for the Nia:
```
env TOOLCHAINDIR=/home/build/inkbox/kernel/toolchain/arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf TARGET=arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf THREADS=16 scripts/build_u-boot.sh n306

[4/13/2022 9:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
the whole screen is shifting when there are recent books, with no special characters in recent books. removing files in `kobo:/opt/config/08-recent_books#` fixes the issue. Its needs a whole redesign, but i just say that its completly broken

there is some interesting... text?

[4/13/2022 11:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Ok thanks


[4/13/2022 11:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's for imgtool

[4/13/2022 11:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
so?


[4/13/2022 11:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
there is some text


[4/13/2022 11:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe a serial number


[4/13/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Unpartitioned space
Contains waveform
Yeah, I'll blank out the serial number


[4/13/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
i hope you do it


[4/13/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
InkBox UID?
Does it match the one in Settings?


[4/13/2022 11:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
?


[4/13/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
InkBox UID is pretty much worthless regarding warranty or anything


[4/13/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Open settings, show system info


[4/13/2022 11:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's a random string of 256 bytes


[4/13/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
its something not from nickel?


[4/13/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
yes its the same

üëç 

[4/13/2022 11:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

[4/13/2022 11:27‚ÄØPM] szybet

[4/13/2022 11:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
In what way is it broken?


[4/13/2022 11:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's normal
There's not enough space for some element


[4/13/2022 11:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
(I suspect the timezone thing)


[4/13/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
its bad


[4/13/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What do you want that I do


[4/13/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It just doesn't fit the screen


[4/13/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
timezone could cut out the text or move the box to the left, if its really it


[4/13/2022 11:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
its a horibble design and it can be fixed


[4/13/2022 11:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I would need to remove the reboot req. text


[4/13/2022 11:31‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Which I'm sure you would say would be worse


[4/13/2022 11:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
no


[4/13/2022 11:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or reduce the qcombobox font size
But I already did that and it's getting really small


[4/13/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe I can do it


[4/13/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
where is the ui file for the seconf page


[4/13/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
In the second page of settings.ui


[4/13/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Don't reduce the font size of timezone label, it will break the design language


[4/13/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The combo box already breaks it in a quiet way and I don't really like it


[4/13/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
what


[4/13/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Or maybe you have a better abbreviation for reboot required


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
a toast after setting timezone


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
There are two arrows on the top right of the qstackedwidget


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
but its not a good fix


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Which would say what?


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Oooh


[4/13/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
what


[4/13/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But if then you mess up one time with the combo box and want to set it again, you have to wait


[4/13/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
That's why I put it in the label


[4/13/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I can't figure out why it needs a reboot but it is needed


[4/13/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
a toast that dissapears after a click?


[4/13/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe


[4/13/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
wait... on arch linux you need to source a file or smth to apply timezone


[4/13/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, here it's a bind mount and symlink problem
Nonsense, I didn't try to understand more


[4/13/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
umount / mount? meh


[4/13/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
That could be something


[4/13/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
where...


[4/13/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe adding that to ibxd and calling it when the combo box value changed could fix the problem


[4/13/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/17051/how-to-change-timezone-to-utc-without-rebooting-aix

maybe this:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1145565/should-i-reboot-after-set-new-timezone-using-timedatectl


[4/13/2022 11:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Don't have access to that now
Otherwise you can click the page_* elements in the right bar


[4/13/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It already works in the rootfs live


[4/13/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe you need to do this in chroot


[4/13/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's just the bind mount in the Kobo chroot that doesn't point to the right thing


[4/13/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
or restart inkbox_gui


[4/13/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You really think an user would like that?


[4/13/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
after clicking ok `applying settings` and 10s wait for the gui


[4/13/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It's like the bind mount records the content of the symlink and never updates it afterwards


[4/13/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] szybet
its better than reboot


[4/13/2022 11:42‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, I think a simple unmount/mount in ibxd can work


[4/13/2022 11:43‚ÄØPM] szybet
thats some serious magic

[4/13/2022 11:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also you need to get back to page 1 before saving the file or it will display the last page you were in in the compiled version


[4/13/2022 11:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No, the text just takes up too much space in the first place


[4/13/2022 11:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I think that fixing the reboot required problem will be better


[4/13/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
cut it off


[4/13/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
use a combo widget that will use the entire screen


[4/13/2022 11:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
really, anything


[4/13/2022 11:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I will do that


[4/14/2022 6:11‚ÄØPM] szybet
is this actually a good idea? in never devices, some other revisions the chips / parts could be diffrent, so a diffrent config is there. it could damage or brick the device?


[4/14/2022 8:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
We'll find out when it happens


[4/14/2022 8:13‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
InkBox is not providing any warranty


[4/14/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
So, not our fault if it breaks the device


[4/14/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
it will be to late


[4/14/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
put a big warning, or make a check status


[4/14/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
dd this and that and compare it


[4/14/2022 8:14‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Also, we don't have a choice
If we don't include that unpartitioned space the device won't boot


[4/14/2022 8:15‚ÄØPM] szybet
a guide, maybe i will write it


[4/14/2022 8:15‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
We need devices to compare


[4/14/2022 8:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
But it is also a nightmare for Kobo to put a different unpartitioned space in each device
So when they change hardware we will probably know


[4/14/2022 8:19‚ÄØPM] szybet
well okay


[4/14/2022 8:21‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Besides, it's not like unpartitioned space from another device will brick it
I have a touch B and put the Touch C image on it
It didn't work well, but no problems and when using a correct U-Boot and kernel there was no permanent damage


[4/14/2022 8:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
well okay but its still risk

The wrong waveform on the Touch B did no harm at all after a clean SD flash

It's an issue for sure on lab126 boards

Ok
I'm just kind of freaking out right now...


[4/15/2022 1:01‚ÄØAM] ninuje
And theoretically, every waveform is tied to a specific vcom

a script that will write the first half of the image and the other one, without overwriting waveform

run wsl2 for it


[4/15/2022 2:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux

do you have a better - safe idea?

You need to invent dd


[4/15/2022 2:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I guess


[4/15/2022 2:16‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Write raw bytes to the MMC

Yes, but no sane user of Windows will be willing to open a terminal and enter commands and do something they haven't ever done before


[4/15/2022 2:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
For now, I will put a warning, also the good thing is that the wrong waveform doesn't seem to brick the device, but the warning will be there


[4/15/2022 2:22‚ÄØPM] szybet
sadly


[4/15/2022 2:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
they should make a copy of the image


[4/15/2022 2:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
everyone


[4/15/2022 2:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, but again it requires cli


[4/15/2022 2:26‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
And imgtool is probably not that suited for Windows or any end user, it uses qemu-nbd and asks for root access every minute

Please test if recoveryfs boots and gets to main GUI interface


[4/20/2022 7:43‚ÄØAM] szybet
Doesn't recovery was made by the update?


[4/20/2022 8:58‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
...no?


[4/20/2022 8:59‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Have you seen the actual size of the recoveryfs?


[4/20/2022 9:57‚ÄØAM] szybet
500 Mb


[4/20/2022 9:58‚ÄØAM] szybet
can i just copy files from the image recovery partition and put then on the kobo?


[4/20/2022 10:29‚ÄØAM] szybet
And why recovery is bigger than rootfs


[4/20/2022 10:29‚ÄØAM] szybet
Are there libraries for p4?


[4/20/2022 1:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
yeah you could do that


[4/20/2022 1:44‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
because it contains user data + rootfs + kernel + u-boot


[4/20/2022 2:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
User data?


[4/20/2022 2:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
contents of p4


[4/20/2022 3:10‚ÄØPM] szybet
This makes more sense


[4/22/2022 6:41‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Does it boot to recoveryfs?


[4/22/2022 7:08‚ÄØAM] szybet
I will check it today

i mean, while going to sleep


[4/24/2022 3:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
when it boots its fine, im asked for it


[4/24/2022 3:45‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yeah, that's sometimes to fix up for 2.0


[4/24/2022 3:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
this horrible sleep manager is back D:


[4/24/2022 3:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to create a github issue or not for this?


[4/24/2022 3:46‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No
I won't forget to fix it


[4/24/2022 3:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
sleep doesn't work even when disabling passcode


[4/24/2022 3:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
not cool


[4/24/2022 3:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
In what way?


[4/24/2022 3:48‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh, look:
1. disabled passcode
2. sleep button clicked
3. error 255
4. it goes back to inkbox
5. it goes to sleep, but in the inkbox menu so it seems like it freezes


[4/24/2022 3:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Maybe try to reboot


[4/24/2022 3:49‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
At least it goes to sleep

[5/2/2022 11:33‚ÄØPM] ninuje

[5/2/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
does li-ion matter? or should there be li-po


[5/2/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
^for battery life


[5/2/2022 11:34‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Doesn't matter, but I don't recall it saying Li-Po anywhere


[5/2/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
well in nickel battery life is better, so im searching the issue


[5/2/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
@tux-linux  how do you launched plato? it has some lib problems


[5/2/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] ninuje
It's available as early as in Mk. 5, at least: https://svn.ak-team.com/svn/Configs/trunk/Kindle/Kobo_Hacks/Scripts/bat_ttl.sh


[5/2/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Nickel aggressively puts the device into standby after ~5s of inactivity


[5/2/2022 11:36‚ÄØPM] ninuje
(actual suspend to ram w/ wakeup pins untouched)


[5/2/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Shouldn't be overly noticeable on i.MX SoCs, though, but makes a huge difference on sunxi


[5/2/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe thats why it was made that the touchscreen puts the device from sleep?


[5/2/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Que?


[5/2/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
edited it, my fault


[5/2/2022 11:37‚ÄØPM] ninuje

[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] ninuje

[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
this makes sense


[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] ninuje
and hall sensor and gyro, for that matter


[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] szybet
but how they did that when i put it properly to sleep, it doesn't wake up when i touch the screen?


[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] ninuje
We've just finished implementing that in KOReader


[5/2/2022 11:38‚ÄØPM] ninuje
state-extended to 1 disables the wakeup pins


[5/2/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
but this didn't worked for the nia?...


[5/2/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] ninuje
*shrug*


[5/2/2022 11:39‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Don't have a Nia, but if it's the same kernel as the Libra 2, it's probably hilariously borked

[5/4/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] szybet
Now we need to know why


[5/4/2022 12:15‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
There is no explanation
When you want to show that sometime doesn't work, it suddenly works


[5/4/2022 12:16‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Suggestion: spam epdc with multiple fbink writes


[5/4/2022 12:19‚ÄØAM] szybet
I was having kobox errors on the self made inkbox 2 month ago, the differences between now and then were:
- my self compiled kernel ( wakeups from the screen were still there 
- no recovery partition
- USB ip, was on, but I turned it on tonight and it works
- files were put be myself on the partition, maybe I missed something, maybe they were damaged because of network
- what more... idk, maybe you know?


[5/4/2022 12:20‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
the only thing I would see would be the kernel
but even there, it isn't related even in a remote way


[5/4/2022 12:20‚ÄØAM] szybet
Time on the device was not working properly


[5/4/2022 12:20‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
again, it's irqwake stuff
...maybe?


[5/4/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] szybet
Maybe I could try an old kernel


[5/4/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
maybe it is the fix for the libra


[5/4/2022 12:21‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
you could
don't expect everything to work in GUI/system though


[5/4/2022 12:22‚ÄØAM] szybet
Yeah, flash the image on it, there is probably your self made inkbox


[5/4/2022 12:23‚ÄØAM] szybet
You could try plato when the error is still there


[5/4/2022 12:23‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
libra has an emmc
so, not doable that easily


[5/4/2022 12:23‚ÄØAM] szybet
Idk, install in some way the system build from image script


[5/4/2022 2:43‚ÄØAM] ninuje
Wi-Fi being enabled or the device being plugged to a power source are somewhat proven way to avoid the epdc issues on the Libra 2, FWIW


[5/4/2022 2:43‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Nonsense
How can that work


[5/4/2022 2:43‚ÄØAM] ninuje
I would wager switching to the performance governor and/or raising the minimum cpu freq would, too


[5/4/2022 2:43‚ÄØAM] tux_linux

why isint it in the script


[5/17/2022 10:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
WHY?


[5/17/2022 10:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
there is a script


[5/17/2022 10:23‚ÄØPM] szybet
why isin't it launched from the main script


[5/17/2022 10:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
For some reason
I don't remember
It could be included


[5/17/2022 10:23‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It is also written in the readme


[5/17/2022 10:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh it is in the readme


[5/17/2022 10:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
so the dumb person here is me


[5/17/2022 10:24‚ÄØPM] szybet
nice...


[5/17/2022 10:24‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, you know the fix

[5/17/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
why isin't debug mode launched?


[5/17/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
its a rooted kernel


[5/17/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Because it can't launch


[5/17/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] szybet
becouse


[5/17/2022 10:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No devices nodes


[5/17/2022 10:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
this makes sense


[5/17/2022 10:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
can't you simple check if files exist ( device nodes ) ?


[5/17/2022 10:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I will add it to the main script


[5/17/2022 10:39‚ÄØPM] szybet
do i need to do it myself / create a github issie?


[5/17/2022 10:40‚ÄØPM] szybet

[5/17/2022 10:44‚ÄØPM] szybet
with what key do i need to sign the gui bundle?


[5/17/2022 10:45‚ÄØPM] szybet
the nia one?


[5/17/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
its an update.isa


[5/17/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
weird


[5/17/2022 10:47‚ÄØPM] szybet
what


[5/17/2022 11:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
so basically how do i update the gui bundle


[5/17/2022 11:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
replace in update/update.isa


[5/17/2022 11:05‚ÄØPM] szybet

What rootfs commit are you on?


[5/17/2022 11:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Try `restart update_inkbox`


[5/17/2022 11:29‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Then relaunch GUI


[5/17/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
i cloned it a hour ago


[5/17/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
```

```


[5/17/2022 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
well


[5/17/2022 11:31‚ÄØPM] szybet
so now how do i add single libraries


[5/17/2022 11:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Repackage bundle


[5/17/2022 11:32‚ÄØPM] szybet
i mean for user apps


[5/17/2022 11:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
they cant do that


[5/17/2022 11:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
```
kobo:(unknown)# service update_inkbox restart
 * Checking for available updates ...
Update skipped or no update available, aborting ...                                                           [ ok ]
ash: getcwd: No such file or directory
kobo:(unknown)# 

```


[5/18/2022 12:26‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
Add them in a lib/ folder for each app, we can tweak ld library path to look there too


[5/18/2022 7:16‚ÄØAM] szybet
How


[5/18/2022 12:47‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Well, for each app that needs a particular lib, we can put it in a folder where the app is /mnt/onboard/.apps/[app-isa-root]/lib


[5/18/2022 12:48‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I think that doing it with squashfs in .isa is simpler for signing


[5/18/2022 12:51‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
The idea:
1. Put .isa app bundle in .apps
2. On next reboot a shell script detects if there are apps there. If yes it verifies the bundle and if successful creates a folder and mounts the app to it. If signature is invalid it might display an alert splash or a dialog (generalDialog) to tell the user.


[5/18/2022 12:52‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It will need to be run each time inkbox_gui starts, and maybe it can be an ibxd FIFO function to allow live updating


[5/18/2022 12:53‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Why did I write this here


[5/18/2022 12:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
stop doing the boot longer


[5/18/2022 12:54‚ÄØPM] szybet
i don't accept this


[5/18/2022 12:54‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
When do you want to verify apps then


[5/18/2022 12:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
we cant verify them once?


[5/18/2022 12:56‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
This is the biggest security risk


[5/18/2022 12:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
and this overcomplicates things


[5/18/2022 12:57‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
You keep asking me for security risks, there's one now


[5/18/2022 12:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
like how will you manage storage for apps? i want to store decks with sanki


[5/18/2022 12:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
i see


[5/18/2022 12:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
For that you can create a folder in apps called `[app-name_data]`


[5/18/2022 12:58‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Please go to #dev


[5/24/2022 11:41‚ÄØPM] szybet

[8/27/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
btw... isint it a risk running an untested kernel?


[8/27/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Very prone to throwing events into the void when it's in low power state


[8/27/2022 7:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
hardware level damage?


[8/27/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] andi15701
the risk is not totally zero, but I think the risk of damaging something while fiddling with serial cable is also there. But I think the most important parts are tested (cpu frequency handling for example). Next risk is mixing up pins. There are some chances to mix something important up


[8/27/2022 7:40‚ÄØPM] andi15701
But I have blew up hardware because of bad kernels


[8/27/2022 7:41‚ÄØPM] szybet
too much voltage on regulators for example?

i have access to everything


[8/27/2022 7:43‚ÄØPM] andi15701
so you can dump regulator states

its possible, not like i knew how

tux-linux would be sad if he lost a contributor

[8/27/2022 7:52‚ÄØPM] szybet
there were also like 3 people in xcsoar project


[8/27/2022 7:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe they would want to do this? they have problems with the existing kernel

Well, from where I'm standing the latest round of i.MX devices are *more* of a failure than the sunxi ones


[8/27/2022 7:56‚ÄØPM] ninuje
We knew going in that the sunxi would be awful at power efficiency


[8/27/2022 7:56‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Because we're used to that on PB devices


[8/27/2022 7:56‚ÄØPM] ninuje
But at least they don't randomly crash  every 5 seconds (lookin' at you, Libra 2)


[8/27/2022 7:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
they need to put a bigger as for capacity battery in them... they are really small

[8/27/2022 7:59‚ÄØPM] ninuje
I'll believe it, AFAIK, rM had trouble with it, and lab126 too, it took them *ages* to polish it for the Oasis 2


[8/27/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Possibly longer than it took them to deal with a new platform for the PW5 (mtk), although they had extensive experience with that one with the Fires


[8/27/2022 8:00‚ÄØPM] ninuje
And it *trounces* the Sage, it's hilarious

[8/27/2022 8:05‚ÄØPM] szybet
in poland only one online shop selled one kobo, it was the nia...


[8/27/2022 8:07‚ÄØPM] andi15701
do they sell tolinos?


[8/27/2022 8:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
no, Kobos only (AFAIK, eBay is not impossible though)


[8/27/2022 8:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Kobo's home country is Canada


[8/27/2022 8:07‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
so, there you go


[8/27/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] andi15701
well, they question was more for @Szybet


[8/27/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
oh


[8/27/2022 8:08‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
it's probably possible to order them from Germany


[8/27/2022 8:09‚ÄØPM] szybet
nope, i havent seen any

but in germany they are everywhere, even in random bool libraries to buy


[8/27/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, a friend of mine bought one when there was a good deal. We thought it would be compatible with my Kobo Clara HD, everyone says they are identical


[8/27/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] andi15701
looked at the chips, and board it seems to be


[8/27/2022 8:10‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but


[8/27/2022 8:11‚ÄØPM] andi15701
*really* looking at the SoC reveals that the shine3 has a imx6sl and not a 6sll


[8/27/2022 8:11‚ÄØPM] andi15701
the kobo bootloader managed to spit something out on serial/


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
that's not identical at all...


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but did not find the sdcard


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
probably PCB issue


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
wrong memory addresses


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but if pictures are bad  you are too lazy to compare


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] andi15701
PCB seems same


[8/27/2022 8:12‚ÄØPM] andi15701
same markings


[8/27/2022 8:13‚ÄØPM] andi15701
too lazy compare exactly


[8/28/2022 1:11‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, these voltages in the nia look quite different


[8/28/2022 1:52‚ÄØPM] andi15701
about the battery connectors in the nia and elsewhere: do you know where to order them or part numbers? The reason I am asking: I would like to do things like current measurement (especially during suspend, e.g. without the need so acces /sys/class/power_supply/*battery/current_now) with a stable setup without testing the protection circuit of the battery every day


[8/28/2022 1:53‚ÄØPM] szybet
just solder cables

or ask on reddit


[8/28/2022 1:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
on the nia i dont think it works
```
kobo:/sys/class/power_supply# cat /sys/class/power_supply/*/current_now
845
kobo:/sys/class/power_supply# 
```
its always 845, even if i turn wifi on


[8/28/2022 1:58‚ÄØPM] andi15701
Every device running my kernel has shown sane values so far


[8/28/2022 1:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
well it also shows, just doesnt change


[8/28/2022 1:59‚ÄØPM] andi15701
because the driver there is a mess


[8/28/2022 1:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[8/28/2022 1:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
as everything


[8/28/2022 1:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe disconnect the battery / supply power over usb?


[8/28/2022 1:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
as what niluje talked, it should work


[8/28/2022 2:00‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, it works


[8/28/2022 2:03‚ÄØPM] andi15701
but for example that messy code turns off the fuel gauge in some situations, I would like to understand the effects, especially on power consumption, and there I have no other chance.


[8/28/2022 2:04‚ÄØPM] andi15701
if those connectors are not found, probably the easiest is to hack the libra


[8/28/2022 2:04‚ÄØPM] andi15701
as the battery has no connectors there anyways


[8/28/2022 2:07‚ÄØPM] andi15701
well, after adding some more kapton tape around the solderig points...


[8/28/2022 2:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
well maybe just use the connector from the battery


[8/28/2022 2:49‚ÄØPM] szybet
cut the wires

I've been doing power draw measurements with a cheap USB meter (because my devices are closed), and it's accurate enough to at least confirm that sunxi is terrible at PM ;o)


[8/28/2022 11:33‚ÄØPM] ninuje
Because, yeah, the sysfs stuff reports wonky shit on NTX kernels, can confirm üòâ


[8/28/2022 11:35‚ÄØPM] ninuje
It's... less helpful on devices that refuse to enter suspend while connected to a power source, though ;o) (Mk < 6, IIRC?)


[8/30/2022 9:11‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, and I want to be able to close my devices also, so I would rather use that plug solution. But for my Libra I would insert something permanently because I do not need to close it because of broken display. Power from battery or from usb is a different situation, so you will have limitied results. Interesting would be the analysis of this: https://github.com/jwrdegoede/rtl8189ES_linux/issues/82 but hopefully the better values of near-mainline kernels will already help here

Someone finally realized that it was dumb as hell, and they stopped shipping that and started actually using the ioctl üòÑ

[8/30/2022 11:43‚ÄØPM] ninuje
IIRC, Cervantes had some comment in their HAL about it on some of their boards, where they purposefully chose to *NOT* power it off because they didn't like the latency trade-off


[8/30/2022 11:43‚ÄØPM] ninuje
That was paired with the usual "we sleep here because ntx told us to" comment around module loading/unloading that anyone that's ever dealt with wifi on ntx should be familiar with üòâ

[8/31/2022 12:03‚ÄØAM] szybet
are we implementing it?


[8/31/2022 12:04‚ÄØAM] tux_linux
no

it works now

there is already too much to do...


[8/31/2022 8:30‚ÄØAM] andi15701
well, that all is silly, userspace should have one way for all devices. That is rfkill block wifi


[8/31/2022 8:30‚ÄØAM] andi15701
and a good kernel should hide most platform-specific stuff


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] andi15701
if you accept removing modules as a solution, rmmod 8189fs


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] szybet
kobo

good kernel

those things dont combine


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] andi15701
does the thing on mainline


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] szybet
so removing modules actually shuts the chip off? no need for this ioctl?


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] andi15701
that is why I am trying to mainline things as much as possible


[8/31/2022 8:31‚ÄØAM] andi15701
on mainline kernels, yes


[8/31/2022 8:32‚ÄØAM] andi15701
the ioctl is simply not there


[8/31/2022 8:32‚ÄØAM] andi15701
on ntx kernels, you can rmmod sdio_wifi_power


[8/31/2022 8:33‚ÄØAM] szybet
oh okay


[8/31/2022 8:33‚ÄØAM] szybet
goos that we already do that


[8/31/2022 8:33‚ÄØAM] szybet
so why koreader has this?


[8/31/2022 8:33‚ÄØAM] andi15701

that also works on mainline


[8/31/2022 8:36‚ÄØAM] szybet
it doesnt crash? cool


[8/31/2022 8:36‚ÄØAM] szybet
is it maybe possible to turn off voltage regulators for maximum power efficency?


[8/31/2022 8:37‚ÄØAM] andi15701
the regulator for the wifi is turned off


[8/31/2022 8:37‚ÄØAM] andi15701
in that case


[8/31/2022 8:37‚ÄØAM] szybet
the rest


[8/31/2022 8:37‚ÄØAM] szybet
they are many


[8/31/2022 8:38‚ÄØAM] andi15701
that is to be researched, and regulators have to be tied to the devices using them


[8/31/2022 8:38‚ÄØAM] szybet
too complicated

why arm isint using chipsets that handle that?


[8/31/2022 8:39‚ÄØAM] andi15701
also complicated


[8/31/2022 8:39‚ÄØAM] andi15701
giving a schematic


[8/31/2022 8:39‚ÄØAM] andi15701
and then we know what the regulators are doing


[8/31/2022 8:40‚ÄØAM] andi15701
what they are for


[8/31/2022 8:53‚ÄØAM] andi15701
and I can properly add that information to the devicetree


[8/31/2022 9:00‚ÄØAM] andi15701
```&usdhc3 {
        pinctrl-names = "default", "state_100mhz", "state_200mhz", "sleep";
        pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usdhc3>;
        pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_usdhc3_100mhz>;
        pinctrl-2 = <&pinctrl_usdhc3_200mhz>;
        pinctrl-3 = <&pinctrl_usdhc3_sleep>;
        vmmc-supply = <&reg_wifi>;
        mmc-pwrseq = <&wifi_pwrseq>;
        cap-power-off-card;
        non-removable;
        status = "okay"; ```
Here i am specifying the power supply for the wifi card. Then the host controller driver will turn off regulator when the card is not used. If no driver for the card is loaded, it is considered not used. A well behaved driver (!= rtl8189fs out-of-mainline-tree driver) will also tell when the card is not used, so the host controller will know what to do


[8/31/2022 9:03‚ÄØAM] andi15701
so here are the information which are in that sdio_wifi_power module or some other dirty ntx stuff on many ntx kernels


[4/1/2023 12:09‚ÄØAM] andi15701
what's up with tp36?


[4/1/2023 12:09‚ÄØAM] andi15701
secondary serial port?


[4/1/2023 12:09‚ÄØAM] szybet
you mean?


[4/1/2023 12:10‚ÄØAM] andi15701
that group of 4 pads next to the console


[4/1/2023 12:11‚ÄØAM] szybet
never tested really


[4/1/2023 12:15‚ÄØAM] andi15701
TP3-TP6: They are connected with the cable to the touchscreen, so probably some i2c around there


[4/1/2023 12:15‚ÄØAM] andi15701
can be detected by running i2cdetect on the corresponding bus


[4/1/2023 12:16‚ÄØAM] andi15701
and just looking at them with a multimeter


[4/1/2023 12:16‚ÄØAM] andi15701
i2cdetect in a loop


[4/1/2023 1:01‚ÄØAM] andi15701
On the clara there is another i2c bus which is more difficult to access on pullups (without zeros on it)   near the lm3630a, the situation might be the same on the nia. Hot candidates are R139, R143, TP26/25, less hot R146, TP84


[4/1/2023 1:01‚ÄØAM] andi15701
but turn off the backlight during any experiments here


[4/1/2023 1:01‚ÄØAM] andi15701
or measurements


[4/1/2023 1:01‚ÄØAM] andi15701
since the backlight has a comparatively high voltage


[4/1/2023 1:03‚ÄØAM] andi15701
lm3630a = U11


[4/1/2023 1:56‚ÄØPM] andi15701
TP182-TP285: UART with HW-handshake hof non-soldered BT chip?


[4/1/2023 1:59‚ÄØPM] szybet
yep


[4/1/2023 2:15‚ÄØPM] andi15701
TP36 really begs for attaching something to it


[4/1/2023 2:16‚ÄØPM] andi15701
using some spring contacts, so without soldering so things keep modular


[4/1/2023 2:18‚ÄØPM] andi15701
lots of distance to any other victim


[4/1/2023 2:19‚ÄØPM] andi15701
so just some backcover with holes in that place is needed


[4/1/2023 2:20‚ÄØPM] andi15701
My guess would be that UART4 is there


[4/1/2023 2:31‚ÄØPM] andi15701
how to find out: 1. check whether there are signs that pins are used by something else


[4/1/2023 2:32‚ÄØPM] andi15701
can be checked via devicetree


[4/1/2023 2:32‚ÄØPM] andi15701
then check that they are configured as gpio


[4/1/2023 2:33‚ÄØPM] andi15701
and then play around with enabling  pullup/-down  ressistors


[4/1/2023 2:33‚ÄØPM] andi15701
via pad configuration in the SoC


[4/1/2023 2:33‚ÄØPM] andi15701
and check if a) gpio input moves, b) voltage on the pins is affected


[4/1/2023 2:34‚ÄØPM] andi15701
that in coarse


[4/1/2023 2:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
could be done


[4/1/2023 3:00‚ÄØPM] andi15701
so uart4 would be gpio64/65 (LCD_ENABLE/LCD_CLK)


[4/1/2023 3:02‚ÄØPM] andi15701
in devicetree if used as gpio: &gpio3 0  &gpio3 1


[4/1/2023 3:02‚ÄØPM] andi15701
no signs of that


[4/1/2023 3:09‚ÄØPM] andi15701
uart2 is &gpio4 6/7, aka gpio102/103 aka NAND_DATA0[45]


[4/12/2023 11:10‚ÄØPM] andi15701
do you have the devicetree?

[4/12/2023 11:18‚ÄØPM] andi15701
if it contains *your* dtb, then I can extract it


[4/12/2023 11:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Yes it's Szybet's unpartitioned space


[4/12/2023 11:19‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
I don't have a Nia


[4/12/2023 11:19‚ÄØPM] andi15701
reason: Kuratius' Nia has U67 soldered and that makes me extremely excited


[4/12/2023 11:20‚ÄØPM] szybet
???


[4/12/2023 11:20‚ÄØPM] andi15701
the qfn thing which is not soldered on your board


[4/12/2023 11:20‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What does it do

[4/12/2023 11:26‚ÄØPM] szybet
and its not soldered to his too?


[4/12/2023 11:26‚ÄØPM] andi15701
it *is* soldered


[4/12/2023 11:27‚ÄØPM] szybet
i dont see a chip in this red square???


[4/12/2023 11:27‚ÄØPM] andi15701
it is an excerpt from your image


[4/12/2023 11:28‚ÄØPM] szybet
but thats kuratios image


[4/12/2023 11:30‚ÄØPM] andi15701
or just an optic illusion


[4/12/2023 11:30‚ÄØPM] szybet
what???...


[4/12/2023 11:31‚ÄØPM] andi15701
so, no not soldered there too


[4/12/2023 11:31‚ÄØPM] andi15701
the pcb looks darker


[4/12/2023 11:32‚ÄØPM] andi15701
and so I got the impression that the chip might be there


[4/12/2023 11:32‚ÄØPM] andi15701
would be too nice


[4/12/2023 11:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
What does it do


[4/12/2023 11:33‚ÄØPM] szybet
in the device tree is something about bluetooth


[4/17/2023 6:06‚ÄØPM] andi15701
has anyone ever compiled a kernel on this device?


[4/17/2023 6:13‚ÄØPM] szybet
on the nia, not for the nia?


[4/17/2023 6:13‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes


[4/17/2023 6:14‚ÄØPM] andi15701
on the nia


[4/17/2023 6:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
why


[4/17/2023 6:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
no


[4/17/2023 6:14‚ÄØPM] szybet
sounds as a horrible idea


[4/17/2023 6:15‚ÄØPM] andi15701
I sometimes to such things for stability tests

I found that comment and that makes no sense


[4/17/2023 6:29‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, there are no separate inputs but there are two separate internal regulators, so you have separate voltages


[4/17/2023 6:30‚ÄØPM] andi15701
and the datasheet says for 900Mhz, typ. 1.275 V and not 1.250V, so again dear NTX what are you doing here?!


[4/17/2023 6:35‚ÄØPM] szybet
shouldnt a compiler / crosscompiler always give the same results, without looking what cpu its running on?


[4/17/2023 6:35‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes, it should but it is often a good stability test


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] andi15701
there are several reports where some "internal gcc errors" were caused by hw stability issues


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] andi15701
I have also seen random error messages


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
stability as in hardware / software load test?


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] andi15701
yes


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
oh, okay


[4/17/2023 6:36‚ÄØPM] szybet
well those are ereaders, not regular pc


[4/17/2023 6:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
its not designed with this in mind


[4/17/2023 6:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe even, depending on time something could burn off


[4/17/2023 6:37‚ÄØPM] szybet
so i have concerns


[4/17/2023 6:56‚ÄØPM] andi15701
well, maybe I am a bit more aggressive here, but you could also have some unintentional load test by opening a too big book, or some web page hogging the cpu when using the internal browser, so I would expect that a device would sustain that.


[4/17/2023 6:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
my point is time


[4/17/2023 6:56‚ÄØPM] szybet
no one tested if an ereader can sustain 30h of full load on everything


[4/17/2023 6:57‚ÄØPM] szybet
maybe temperature of one of the components is slowly going up


[4/17/2023 6:58‚ÄØPM] andi15701
well, I do not urge you to try that thing, and I would not do in the hot sun


[4/17/2023 6:58‚ÄØPM] szybet
i had this problem on an asus tablet, luckly it was the cpu so it just shutted down


[4/17/2023 7:32‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
No


[4/17/2023 7:33‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
My Kobo hardware has sustained heavy loads more times than it would ever have wanted to and it's still working


[4/17/2023 7:34‚ÄØPM] szybet
for how many h


[4/17/2023 7:39‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Days?


[4/17/2023 7:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
It can throttle itself if needed


[4/17/2023 7:40‚ÄØPM] tux_linux
Didn't catch on fire


[4/17/2023 7:40‚ÄØPM] szybet
cpu, yes, other components, not really


[4/18/2023 4:01‚ÄØAM] ninuje
I remember poeple building a lot of stuff on-device back in the Kindle Touch days, too, FWIW


[4/28/2023 8:30‚ÄØAM] andi15701
well the regulator driver takes the voltages from a cache, which is never initialized if regulator is probed via devicetree (which is the case with the nia), so we are seeing the lowest end of the possible voltage range. The cache is in that case only set if the voltage is explicitely set by the kernel and not kept at boot state.


[4/28/2023 8:31‚ÄØAM] andi15701
Nasty surprises with ntx kernels everywhere... I hate that
