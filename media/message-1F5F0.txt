Options:
    -a          toggle autoskip: A single '*' replaces nul-lines. Default off.
    -b          binary digit dump (incompatible with -ps,-i,-r). Default hex.
    -C          capitalize variable names in C include file style (-i).
    -c cols     format <cols> octets per line. Default 16 (-i: 12, -ps: 30).

    -l len      stop after <len> octets.
    -o off      add <off> to the displayed file position.
    -ps         output in postscript plain hexdump style.
    -r          reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into binary.
    -r -s off   revert with <off> added to file positions found in hexdump.
    -d          show offset in decimal instead of hex.
    -s [+][-]seek  start at <seek> bytes abs. (or +: rel.) infile offset.
    -u          use upper case hex letters.
