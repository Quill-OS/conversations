# /tmp/sleep_status steps in chronological order:
# waiting - nothing, its just waiting
# preparing - its turning everything off, its needed to wait
# sleeping - its sleeping already. This mode is only for user information, not used in code
# restoring - after sleeping, restoring wifi for example

### TO DO: avoid launching multiple scripts becouse restart doesn't kill it
