1.5 => 1.6 Setup

Once you have InkBox working on your device and your ready to upgrade Plug the device into your computer.

Allow your device to access your computer.

Open the device with your file system.

If you have any books on the device you will see it here.
You should also see a folder called .inkbox.
If you do not see this folder you may need to turn on the 'Hidden Files' option in your file manager.
Drag and drop the two files listed into the folder.
Once the files have copied over safely remove the device from the computer and restart the device.
Once the device has restarted you should get a pop-up notice to update.
	
	NOTE: If your Kobo gets stuck longer then 2 min on the "Updating Screen" and the progress dots no longer are moving, then hold the power button for 10 seconds to restart the device. The update process should continue normally.  
	
Once the update is done an information screen will appear telling you of the improvments.
